Environmentally-friendly operations along the Tagus river will transform metropolitan commuting in Portugal’s capital city

The new fleet will play an integral role in delivering Portugal’s goal of carbon neutrality by 2050

The first of ten new, all-electric ferries opens a new age of emission-free commuter services along Lisbon’s Tagus River, in the latest example of green transformation from Portugal’s capital city. The vessel, whose operations rely on an integrated power, automation, energy storage and propulsion solution from ABB, has now been delivered to the ferry operator Transtejo by the Astilleros Gondán shipyard. Replacing a fleet of older, fossil fuel-burning ferries, the 40-meter, 540-passenger vessels will also improve passenger comfort and reduce operational and maintenance costs.

“Delivering the first of these 10 ferries is an important milestone for us, and it is a joy to see her on the water in Lisbon. We very much look forward to delivering the other nine,” said Antonio Pacheco, Director of GRP Division, Astilleros Gondán.

Ferry electrification is a key part of Portugal’s strategy to reach carbon neutrality by 2050. Consolidating Lisbon’s reputation as one of the most environmentally-friendly cities in the world, the electric ferry program continues a transformative period for a municipality which won the 2020 European Green Capital award.

“Lisbon is making waves as a pioneer in environmentally-friendly public transportation, as many of the world’s cities realize the benefits electric ferries bring for sustainability,” said Juha Koskela, Division President, ABB Marine & Ports. “ABB’s leading position in integrated electrification solutions for urban ferries is a highly visible example of our work to make the maritime industry safer, smarter, and more sustainable. We at ABB are proud to play a key role in shaping shipping’s new reality.”

With power distribution managed by ABB Onboard DC Grid™ ensuring that output of each ship’s 1,860-kWh battery pack is safe, reliable and optimized, ABB estimates the new ferries will cut about 6,500 tons in CO 2 emissions along the Tagus river every year – equivalent to the emissions of 1,400 passenger cars.

ABB is also providing the control and rectifier systems for shore power as well as an advanced communications system which identifies the vessel arriving, its charging status and the power required, enabling the ferries to recharge within 5-10 minutes.

With latest figures from the Maritime Battery Forum[1] showing 586 battery powered vessels in operation worldwide, and 195 more on order, ferry owners remain at the forefront of switching to hybrid and electric vessel propulsion. ABB works closely with ferry companies around the world, supplying integrated hybrid and electric propulsion solutions. Recent projects include the Maid of the Mist Niagara Falls tour boats, ‘Fusion Class’ ships for P&O Ferries, a new ferry connecting mainland Iceland and Vestmannaeyjar island, and ferry conversions for Swedish owner ForSea Ferries.",ABB Drives Emission Free River Commute In Lisbon With First All Electric Ferry

The upgrade has enabled LondonEnergy to improve the plant’s resilience and enable the connection of an additional steam turbine, which will increase annual green energy production to 1,000 megawatt-hours (MWh), equivalent to the electricity consumption of 80,000 homes and businesses.

“By upgrading our existing EfW plant, we have renewed confidence in our ability to keep waste out of landfill and minimise our carbon footprint. The new system allows us to monitor, control and automate the entire EfW plant’s electrical assets from one touch-screen user interface,” said Charles Bell, LondonEnergy’s E&I Manager.

An important feature of the project is the ABB Ability™ Electrification Monitoring and Control ZEE600, one of the first to be deployed in the UK. It acts as a hub to integrate data from five generators, as well as power distribution systems, grid connection, and drives and motors in waste-handling units. Operators interact with the system via a touch-screen interface that gives visibility and control, as well as access to alerts and historic performance data.

ABB supplied a total of 63 panels of UniGear ZS1 11 (kV) double busbar and 3.3 kV single busbar electrical switchgear to protect service continuity and provide redundant power capability. VD4G generator circuit breakers (GCBs) were selected to meet the most stringent requirements for generator applications. Their fault-handling capability was established by a power study that enabled the team to replicate the installation’s original electrical parameters. On top of offering comprehensive generator protection, ABB’s advanced Relion® REX640 relays are also able to automatically perform generator breaker synchronization, a crucial task for safe connection to the grid.

The project required upgrading of four original generators and interfacing them with a modern digital control system, as well as adding a new generator. To achieve this, ABB’s global experts in power studies and consulting delivered in-depth modelling and analysis, before developing a scheme that seamlessly combines the existing and new technologies. ABB also delivered training to help LondonEnergy’s operators transition to the latest control technology.

“Extending the life of an existing facility can have huge sustainability benefits by avoiding or delaying construction of a new site. When it was built 50 years ago, the original engineers could never have foreseen that we would integrate their generators into a modern digital control system,” said Stephen Gibbs, ABB’s UK Product Marketing Director for Distribution Solutions. “Our extensive research, modelling and simulations showed that it is possible to upgrade existing assets and it’s an approach that we can replicate elsewhere.”

By joining ABB in this endeavor, U.S. businesses have an opportunity to collectively reduce energy consumption, significantly slow the rate at which they are contributing to climate change — and mitigate the risk of overregulation.

These goals can be achieved by upgrading outdated industrial infrastructure with new generation energy-efficient technologies, such as high-efficiency motors and variable speed drives. The potential impact of this solution is illustrated in a recent report entitled “U.S. Industrial and Commercial Motor System Market Assessment Report,” co-authored by research scientist Dr. Prakash Rao, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, which highlights where some of the most prominent sources of energy wastage exist in our industrial and commercial infrastructure.

In most cases, according to ABB’s NEMA Motor Div. President Jesse Henson, the savings from a company’s increased energy efficiency can achieve a full return on the cost to install new generation technology within approximately two years of the original investment.

“While the adverse effects of climate change persist, ABB is investing in technologies which can help us all reduce our impact on the environment,” Henson said. “We now offer the most energy­efficient motors and drives in the industry, so we are choosing to actively lead that discussion and educate our industrial partners on how they can reduce their electricity consumption and effectively slow the rate of climate change in the process.”

In December, ABB hosted a virtual roundtable discussion to explore the high­efficiency solutions currently available on the market today and explain the proper course for affordable integration. The event explored the practical benefits and data of integrating high-efficiency solutions into existing industrial and commercial infrastructure to affordably and immediately reduce the impact of climate change. Attendees participating in the roundtable heard from featured guests included Dr. Rao, Henson, and ABB Motion President Morton Wierod.

“Now every commercial building and industrial process can be a part of a change in our climate and a solution. Motors and drives together just make the world a better place. By choosing to invest in these technologies and reducing the amount of electricity we consume, we can make a difference,” Henson said. “ABB is a part of the solution for a better planet. I believe it is our duty to make a difference for a better tomorrow. But we need your help to get the message out about this invisible climate solution.”

ABB shared energy transition insights at summit attended by Norwegian Crown Prince Haakon and the UK Secretary of State for New Energy and Net Zero Grant Shapps.

Appointment with Royalty for ABB’s Offshore Wind Electrification Solutions

An ABB delegation joined Norwegian Crown Prince Haakon and the UK’s Secretary of State for New Energy and Net Zero, Grant Shapps MP, at an energy transition summit on Wednesday, March 1 in London. The one-day event, attended by 500 energy business leaders and government officials from Norway and the UK, strengthened collaborations between the two countries to achieve net zero by 2050.



The event emphasized the significance of policy frameworks, investments, advancement in digitalization and artificial intelligence and cross-border cooperation between the United Kingdom and Norway. It also sought to address the challenges and solutions to reduce emissions intensity in the production of offshore oil and gas through electrification and offshore wind power.



With more than 40 years’ experience as a technology leader in power generation, management and control of offshore wind, ABB was invited to present how the electrification of offshore facilities and the integration of renewables can help accelerate the energy transition.



“It was an honour to be able to demonstrate to this summit how ABB’s electrification, automation and digitalization technologies are playing a key role in electrifying offshore assets with renewables, integrating offshore wind into the energy mix to help reduce industrial CO2 emissions,” said Asmund Maland, senior vice president Subsea and Offshore Power at ABB Energy Industries. “Such technology also enhances safety, drives productivity, ensures reliability and increases efficiency for offshore energy producers.”



The environmental benefits of offshore wind extend beyond boosting the amount of clean energy in the overall mix. For example, at Hywind Tampen in the Norwegian North Sea – the world’s first floating windfarm to power oil and gas platforms–offshore wind generation is being used to decarbonize hydrocarbon projects. Supplying renewable electricity to oil and gas fields reduces the emissions per barrel of the oil produced. ABB’s scope of work on the project includes an automation solution that controls the power generation from the windfarm so it can be connected to the oil and gas operations.



The UK is committed to becoming a clean energy superpower by the end of this decade. In December 2022, the government signed an agreement on offshore renewable energy cooperation with the EU and North Sea countries. The collaboration of development of offshore renewable energy and grid infrastructure will support the UK’s target to increase offshore wind fivefold to 50 GW by 2030.



“For both the UK and Norway, enhancing our energy security and independence is an absolute priority – moving away from volatile international markets in fossil fuels and towards greater use of alternative energy sources,” said Grant Shapps MP, Secretary of State for New Energy and Net Zero. “Today’s extension of the historic partnership between our two nations–will do just that, boosting our use of the latest green technologies to ensure security of supply, and increasing cooperation on the latest innovations and developments that will maintain our positions as world leaders in this field.”

The world’s most potent greenhouse gas has been replaced with an alternative that its developers say is much more sustainable in several railway switchgears in Germany.

Commonly used in electrical switchgears and other energy infrastructure for its excellent insulation properties, sulfur hexafluoride (SF 6 ) has a global warming potential 25,200-times that of carbon dioxide and lasts in the atmosphere for about 3,200 years.

With ambitious plans to decarbonise the German rail network by 2040 and eliminate use of SF 6 in its switchgear, Deutsche Bahn awarded Swedish-Swiss multinational ABB a contract to supply its first three-phase gas insulated switchgear solutions that are free of SF 6 . The technology will be used in four charging substations dedicated to battery-powered trains for Schleswig-Holstein, the northernmost state of Germany.

The devices replace SF 6 with AirPlus, which ABB described as a “sustainable gas mixture” that almost eliminates global warming potential.

“ABB’s SF 6 -free technology offers an interesting alternative to conventional assets, especially in terms of eliminating harmful greenhouse gases,” said Thomas Wehr, product manager at Deutsche Bahn’s Rail Power Systems contractor. “The switchgear can be integrated into our substation design without any problems.”

Other features of the new switchgears include ‘run flat’ technology, designed to enable continued operation in the event of a leak. The devices are designed to generate 20% less heat than conventional options, and integrated sensors can enable remote monitoring.

The European Commission recently proposed plans to ban SF 6 from new medium voltage electrical equipment from 2026 for applications up to 24kV, and from 2030 for applications up to 52kV.

Northern Lights, a joint venture between energy majors Equinor, Shell and TotalEnergies, is said to be the first industrial carbon capture and storage (CCS) project to develop an open and flexible infrastructure to safely store CO2 from industries across Europe.

The first phase of the project is due to be completed in mid-2024 and will have the capacity to permanently store up to 1.5 million tons of CO2 per year, with the ambition to expand to over five million tons per year in a second development phase.

The two vessels will support the Northern Lights CCS project by transporting greenhouse gas from industrial emitters to an onshore terminal in Øygarden, Norway. From there, the CO2 will be delivered by pipeline to dedicated reservoirs 2,600 meters under the seabed in the North Sea for permanent storage.

Each of the 130-meter ships will be able to carry up to 7,500 cubic meters of liquefied C02 in purpose-built pressurised cargo tanks.\

ABB’s permanent magnet shaft generator system is expected to increase the fuel efficiency of these ships, reducing emissions as a result. Combining this technology with variable-speed engines allows harvesting power for all onboard systems through the rotating force of the shaft, significantly improving performance compared to a traditional setup with fixed speed engines, according to the company.

The CO2 carriers, which are due for delivery in 2024, will be constructed by the Chinese shipbuilder Dalian Shipbuilding Industry Company (DSIC).

“As a longstanding partner of ABB, we are delighted to offer shipping companies the efficiencies, ease of installation and space savings enabled by permanent magnet shaft generator systems,” said a Dalian Shipbuilding Industry Company spokesperson.

ABB announced in June 2022 that it will also deliver the main electrical, automation and safety systems for the Northern Lights project, enabling the remote operation of the terminal and ensuring that the facility runs at optimum efficiency.

ABB’s scope of supply also covers full engineering and commissioning services. In addition, the vessels will have access to the ABB Ability Marine Remote Diagnostic System for continuous equipment monitoring, optimized machinery and planned-maintenance activities, and reduced maintenance costs.

CCS plays an important role in meeting global climate and energy goals. Today, CCS facilities around the world have the capacity to capture more than 40 million tons of CO2 from power and industrial facilities, according to IEA.

While the transport of trapped CO2 to permanent storage locations by pipeline is already deployed at a large scale, it can present a challenge when the point of capture is further removed from a storage facility. Ships offer a flexible solution for long-distance CO2 transportation.

Throughout April the demonstration will feature in a window display an ABB robot 3D printing a variety of personalized designer objects made from Parley Ocean Plastic® – intercepted marine plastic debris collected from Parley’s Global Cleanup network.

The 3D printing demonstration is part of Selfridges’ SUPERMARKET concept, which challenges consumers to think about how the goods they purchase are produced and the impact of this production on the environment.

“While expanded choice is great for consumers, it also comes at a cost to the environment, with products and packaging often being discarded with little thought about where they end up or whether they get recycled,” says Marc Segura, ABB’s Robotics Division President. “By re-using plastic from the world’s oceans to print designer objects, we help to highlight the important contribution of robots in creating the sustainable manufacturing processes central to a circular economy.”

Developed in partnership with environmental organization and global network, Parley for the Oceans, and innovative design brand Nagami, the demonstration will use ABB’s simulation software RobotStudio® and an IRB 6700 robot to create a variety of printed furniture, homeware, and other objects made from Parley Ocean Plastic. The robot will work with Nagami’s unique plastic extruder to print the objects, which can be selected by customers on a screen and made to order on the premises.

“Parley Ocean Plastic was invented to catalyze change in response to marine plastic pollution and the destruction of our oceans,” says Parley founder and CEO Cyrill Gutsch. ""Working with two industry leaders, ABB and Nagami, we can now print on demand anywhere in the world to turn a problem into a solution. Beyond the huge potential for reducing waste by printing directly inside retail locations like Selfridges, we want to use this technology to empower local communities across the globe – giving them the tools to turn local plastic pollution into business opportunities and useful objects. For the oceans, climate and life.”

Robotic transformation of the retail experience

As well as underlining the importance of eco-innovation, the demonstration will also help to highlight the wider potential of robotic automation in helping retailers attract customers into their stores. Robots are already being used in increasing numbers in inventory and delivery management and in-store services, with research organization Coherent Market Insights1 estimating a 30 percent growth in the uptake of robots in retail by 2028.

“Robots are increasingly used to help draw customers back to the high street,” says Segura. “We believe that future adoption will be influenced by three main trends including micro-fulfilment, where robots are used in-store to enable order fulfilment and delivery; personalization, where a robot makes a product to a customer’s specific requirements, with the added option of automatic personalization where data on previous purchasing habits is used to offer new choices; and ‘retailtainment’, where the robot is used as part of an interactive display or show to inform or entertain customers.”

One example is ABB’s robotic demo at German fashion retailer Solebox’s store in Berlin, which picks shoes selected by customers using a screen. If the shoe doesn’t fit or the customer would like to try something else, the robot picks it up from the drawer and returns it to the shelf. In China, a retail kiosk developed by Chinese mobile communications company, Huawei in conjunction with ABB, allows customers to collect a range of devices including smartphones and tablets. Designed to be situated in high street locations, the kiosk uses ABB’s FlexBuffer system to select devices either ordered online or purchased onsite. Once selected, the products are placed into a collection drawer for the customer to take away.

“The ability to introduce robots into their stores both behind and in front of the counter offers exciting opportunities for retailers,” concludes Marc Segura. “By using robots to handle in-store micro-fulfilment operations, staff can be released to people-facing roles, allowing them to focus more on providing customers with a better all-round experience.

“As demonstrated by the installation at Selfridges, robots can also be used on the shop floor to enable personalized production of goods at the point of consumption, adding a whole new dimension to the retail experience.”

This new customer segment broadens ABB’s portfolio as part of a wider strategy to accelerate expansion into new and high-growth segments including logistics, healthcare, and construction.

The study named ‘Billions of better decisions: industrial transformation’s new imperative’ explores how the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) can potentially provide efficiency gains, reduce emissions and encourage further sustainability from businesses.

Sustainability as a digital, industrial practice

Peter Terwiesch, President of ABB’s Process Automation business area, understands the importance of considering sustainability in digital transformation as he says: “Sustainability goals more and more are a crucial driver of business value and company reputation, and Industrial IoT solutions are playing an increasingly important role in helping enterprises achieve safe, smart and sustainable operations.”

But how do businesses utilise technology to make these sustainable changes?

The report highlights some key information on this, while also stating that 96% of leaders or decision-makers have said that digitalisation is an essential step in achieving industrial sustainability. “Unlocking insights hidden in operational data holds the key to enabling literally billions of better decisions throughout industry and acting upon them, with significant gains in productivity, reduced energy consumption and lower environmental impact,” explains Terwiesch.

Here are some of the key points from industry mentioned in the report:

More than 90% of the respondents from the survey agreed that to achieve sustainability, digitalisation is critical

Around 72% divulged their increased spending on IIoT to improve sustainability

Cybersecurity was regarded as one of the most prominent threats to more sustainable industrial operations with the use of IIoT

The pandemic has driven around 71% of respondents to make sustainable business a high priority

ABB innovates for sustainability

The report was carried out by ABB to highlight the demand and benefits of IIoT in improving upon emissions and managing energy consumption. This being spurred on by the figures from the International Energy Agency (IEA), which “estimates that industry accounts for more than 40% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions today,” Terwiesch says.

“If we are to reach climate objectives such as the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement, industrial organisations need to implement digital solutions as part of their sustainability strategies. Embracing these technologies at all levels – from the boardroom to the facility floor – is key, as every member of the industrial workforce can become a better decision-maker when it comes to sustainability.”

So, how can companies achieve this?

ABB is continuously developing its technical capabilities to provide leading technologies that impact the businesses contributions to environmental issues. On its own, ABB has reduced its GHG emissions by 25% over the past two years, as an integral commitment of its 2030 sustainability strategy. This strategy outlines the firm’s efforts to become carbon neutral by 2030 and provide its ABB Ability portfolio to allow its clients to achieve similar goals.

• The global production hub’s latest sustainability milestone marks the delivery of zero production waste to landfill in just two years

• The standard set by the Frosinone site reinforces ABB’s commitment to preserving resources, having achieved a 27 percent reduction in overall company waste from 2013 to 2020

Zero production waste to landfill has been achieved at ABB Smart Power’s manufacturing unit in Frosinone, Italy — 14 years ahead of the European Union’s Circular Economy Package target of no more than 10 percent landfilling by 2035.

Driven by rapid urbanization and growing populations, global annual waste generation is expected to jump to 3.4 billion tons over the next 30 years, up from two billion tons in 2016. Some 37 percent of this global waste is disposed of in a landfill1. Landfills, long the default for waste removal across the world, are considered unsustainable. Space is running out and landfilling contributes to climate change through the high levels of methane and carbon dioxide generated by rotting rubbish that could otherwise be re-used.

Opened in 1969, ABB’s Frosinone factory represents a center of excellence in ABB for the development and manufacture of low-voltage circuit breakers. The 150,000 square-meter facility with 800 employees is highly automated and produces more than three million circuit breakers every year. A Lighthouse Plant, selected by the Italian government as a model for digital transformation and Industry 4.0 strategies, Frosinone promotes smart, digitalized, and connected operations, increasing efficiency across the full value chain. Achieving zero production waste to landfill was a whole-factory program.

ABB is steadily reducing its environmental footprint through waste reduction and recycling programs at its sites around the world, building on the 27 percent reduction in overall waste achieved over the 2013–2020 period. “Preserving resources is a key pillar of ABB’s Sustainability 2030 strategy, with zero waste to landfill – wherever local conditions allow – an explicit target,” said Theodor Swedjemark, Chief Communications and Sustainability Officer, ABB. “The benchmark on zero production waste achieved at ABB’s Frosinone facility serves as a testament to fast, tangible progress on that strategy and on more circular operations, moving past the unsustainable ‘take, make, dispose’ model of production.”

Giampiero Frisio, President Smart Power Division, said: “We have proven at our Frosinone plant that with the right attitude and commitment from everyone across the business, zero waste to landfill is achievable. Since announcing our zero waste ambitions in 2017, this latest milestone signifies how we are leading positive change across our full production chain, delivering more sustainable solutions for all our stakeholders.”

Staff training was critical in educating, empowering and building the right attitude and culture for the zero-production waste to landfill initiative. Training topics included managing waste in accordance with current environmental legislation and the importance of waste separation. By getting the teams engaged, handling personnel became more involved in the correct management of the waste area.

Waste sorting and identification is set up at the place where waste originates. There are about 150 different labeled production waste containers and separated paper-cardboard and plastic waste containers in each workstation. The same amount of waste is coded as before, but with higher degrees of separation comes a higher percentage of waste recovery.

ABB Smart Power’s manufacturing unit in Frosinone is exploring more sustainable practices such as reduced CO 2 emissions by optimizing processes across the entire supply chain, a circular manufacturing process, reducing transportation and increasing plastics recovery.

Power products for floating offshore wind

Switzerland-headquartered Hitachi ABB Power Grids has launched a portfolio of transformer products for offshore floating wind farms.

The portfolio, which Hitachi developed in partnership with floating offshore wind developers, includes collector step-up transformers, which step up turbine generator output voltage from a few hundred volts to the collector system’s medium voltage distribution levels; earthing transformers; shunt reactors – absorbers of reactive power – for floating substations; and wind turbine transformers for floating wind turbines.

Hitachi ABB, which announced on Friday that it will switch to 100% fossil-free electricity by the end of this year, says its new transformer products will enable much greater volumes of wind to be efficiently harvested and integrated into energy systems.

The Biden administration announced on May 25 that the US Pacific Coast will be open to commercial-scale offshore clean energy projects for the first time, and floating offshore wind technology will need to be utilized in California waters because the continental shelf falls away quickly, into deep waters. So Hitachi’s floating electrical systems are a timely arrival for that announcement, and for the fledgling floating offshore wind industry in general.

Check out Hitachi ABB’s video below about their new transformers for floating wind turbines, and how offshore floating wind will unleash great clean energy potential:

Kriegers Flak wind turbines

Turbine installation is complete at what is now Denmark’s largest wind farm. The 604 megawatt Kriegers Flak offshore wind farm is 9 to 25 miles (15 to 40 kilometers) off the east coast of Denmark in the Baltic Sea. It will provide enough energy for around 600,000 Danish households and increase Danish wind production by around 16%.

Kriegers Flak consists of 72 Siemens Gamesa 8.4 MW turbines, installed by offshore development company Jan De Nul. Each turbine is 617 feet (188 meters) in height. The 72nd wind turbine was installed on June 5, and the first turbine was installed in February.

The wind farm will be serviced out of Swedish energy company Vattenfall’s new service facility at the Port of Klintholm, which is south of Copenhagen.

Kriegers Flak’s testing will need to be finalized, and it will then be certified, so that it can come online after summer.

Catrin Jung, head of offshore wind in Vattenfall, said:

Despite COVID-19, we have been able to deliver according to plan – actually a little ahead of schedule.

To enable the transformation to a sustainable society and preserve resources, production of solar collector panels must be precise, highly efficient and cost effective.

To achieve this, Absolicon and ABB have developed the world’s only complete solution for the mass production of concentrated solar collectors, in Absolicon’s factory in Härnösand, Sweden.

The degree of automation has increased production drastically. Absolicon’s robotic production line now uses two ABB robots to produce a solar collector panel every six minutes, compared with up to only three units produced a day using previous manual production methods.

Joakim Byström, CEO of Absolicon, says: “Developing an automated production process enables our global business case by radically reducing the price of our solar collectors, while manufacturing them consistently to a very high quality.

“The productivity offered by ABB’s robots means we can make solar energy compete on price with conventional industrial heating for the first time.

“Our new automated production line can produce a complete solar collector every six minutes, so while competitors rely on a manually intensive manufacturing process, we can now do it with five people, two robots and a fraction of the components.”

Absolicon has been developing sustainable solar technology for 20 years and produces parabolic solar collectors that are the most efficient in their class, generating heat and steam up to 160 degrees for industrial companies and district heating networks.

Sami Atiya, president of ABB’s Robotics & Discrete Automation, says: “We’re pleased that ABB’s robotics solutions are accelerating the productivity, quality and cost efficiency of Absolicon’s production line to enable them to bring a renewable energy product to market at a competitive price.

“In helping Absolicon to accelerate their production from three units a day to one every six minutes, our robotics solutions are playing a key role in accelerating the global adoption of sustainable technology, ensuring Absolicon’s production partners are able to consistently produce solar collector panels globally.”

Byström says: “Our vision is to enable a cost-effective mass-production of solar collectors across the world, to produce heat directly from sunlight.

“Our work with ABB to create this automated production process is a key enabler to realize our vision, while ABB’s global service organization will be a very valuable resource for our new customers as we roll-out our new automated production line globally.”

The next phase of the project involves supplying complete robotic production lines to manufacturing partners across the globe and ABB and Absolicon have agreed they will collaborate on the development, sales and marketing of the robotic production line worldwide.

The first installation has already been delivered to a partner in China, and framework agreements for the acquisition of robotic production lines have been signed with businesses in a dozen countries, with ABB supplying the robots for all new installations.

But the industry veteran knew his stringent sustainability goals weren’t possible working for a giant, so in 2019 he departed and two years later launched the brand Unless Collective.

“To be scalable and to disrupt, I needed to step outside the machine and do it from the bottom up,” Liedtke told FN. “We want to be the first 100% regenerative fashion brand, we want to pilot the whole thing, so we can then offer it as a service to the industry.”

More from Footwear News

Unless, a label with a streetwear lean, has already made significant strides in sustainable fashion after just two years. Its apparel, which debuted in November 2021, is made with only biodegradable, plant-based materials, to eliminate plastic waste. And the company created a takeback program that repairs, recycles or composts used products.

To boost awareness and foster collaboration, it is lining up a string of compelling partnerships. Its first was with Mammut for a hoodie and T-shirt released on World Mountain Day last December. “The collab was about protecting the places they play. It was cool and it exploded,” Liedtke said. “This is our model, to show what we offer is a great story to tell consumers and to build consumer advocacy — and it helps build our audience.”

Liedtke said three other collaborations in the works, though he remained mum on details.

Unless has also made inroads on sustainable footwear. In December, the brand revealed its first shoe, a skate style dubbed the Degenerate.

It was created with several plant-based materials from innovation company Natural Fiber Welding, including Pliant outsoles, Tunera foam midsoles, Mirum for the eyelet and mudguards and more. Also, the shoe was created to decompose at the end of its life.

Story continues

After selling out last December, Unless restocked the Degenerate in February, and it is available via Unlesscollective.com for $139.

Having proven its methods can yield market-ready product, Unless is now looking collaborate with the sneaker giants. “Our role is to show there is a better way, to show the momentum of the product and then talk to brands to partner,” Liedtke said. “I can now offer this to brands and say, ‘I have a solution, let’s do collections together, let’s do some things that can be fun.’”

For many in the sustainability space, performance footwear has been off limits because of quality concerns around eco-friendly materials. But after creating a cupsole skate shoe, Liedtke is confident performance-based styles are possible.

“We did this shoe inside of two-and-a-half years, so your running shoe is going to be there. It’s a capital raise away,” he declared.

For now, Unless does have more releases on the horizon. Liedtke said the brand has found tooling it likes and will pair it with different uppers, though the concept is still in the prototyping stage.

As for its retail strategy, Unless is branching out beyond its DTC channel to launch wholesale at the end of 2023. It is targeting streetwear doors and those in the surf-skate space.

“The criteria is: You have to tell the story,” Liedtke said. “Product times story makes a difference to the consumer. If you don’t have that story, what’s the reason to buy a shoe? You can’t just put our shoe on the shelf next to 1,000 Air Force 1s, Dunks or Jordans.”

When it comes to the gear you choose to train, there are ways to make what’s good for you, better for the planet. Self-care and caring for the planet can be on equal footing.

Taking strides for the environment, Adidas is helping consumers End Plastic Waste(opens in a new tab) by making their products and processes more sustainable. They’re swapping out virgin materials for recycled ones, creating products that can be remade, and working more closely with nature for inspiration.

Here’s a look at how Adidas is running in the right circles for sustainability.

Turning ocean plastic into polyester

Polyester is the most widely used fiber in the world because it’s durable, versatile, and lightweight, but virgin polyester is not sustainable. The upside? It can be made from recycled plastic and other more planet-friendly alternatives. By 2024, Adidas(opens in a new tab) is switching to recycled polyester wherever possible. Putting this into action already, they use high-performance yarn made from 50% ocean plastic and 50% recycled polyester. Ocean plastic looks terrible on a beach — but great on your feet as sneakers(opens in a new tab).

Reducing used apparel in landfills

With apparel and footwear designed to feel comfortable down to your soles(opens in a new tab), now your soul can feel good, too. Adidas is finding new life for worn-out products. Once you’ve had your full run with a product, instead of tossing it in the garbage, scan the Made to Be Remade(opens in a new tab) QR code and send it back to Adidas. They’ll turn your used gear into recycled articles of clothing or shoes sending less waste to landfills. In fashion, the hottest trends always come back.

Racing toward carbon neutrality

In moving toward having 90% of their products contain a sustainable material by 2025, Adidas has hit some impressive milestones, including creating the world’s lowest carbon footprint running shoe back in 2021 with 63% less emissions. The possibilities to End Plastic Waste are here now, whether it’s joining a beach cleanup with Parley(opens in a new tab), Adidas’ partner for repurposing ocean plastic, or buying products made with sustainable fibers(opens in a new tab).

A fifth of Global 100 companies are US-based, making it the leading country for members of the index, followed by Canada with 11%. However, as a region, Europe still leads the way with 44%, while Asia Pacific hosts 22% of the ranking companies.

Sporting goods companies Puma and adidas have remained on the list, improving their rankings, from 77 to 47, and from 82 to 66, respectively.

Activewear company Gildan also improved its ranking from 79 to 60, and was the only apparel manufacturing company included on the list globally. While luxury goods company Kering slid down the list from number 12 last year to 31.

Glenn Chamandy, president and CEO of Gildan, said: “We are pleased to be recognised by Corporate Knights’ once more, demonstrating Gildan’s strong commitment to ESG. Our increased ranking reflects our dedication and hard work in developing and advancing our Next Generation ESG strategy over the past year which includes increasing gender diversity, focusing on sustainable investments, employee safety, and linking executive compensation to ESG targets, amongst other initiatives. Under this strategy, we are driving ESG further into our business and remain committed to the path ahead to ensure that our products are made with respect for our people, the environment, and our communities from start to finish.”

Corporate Knights’ 2023 ranking of the world’s 100 most sustainable corporations is based on a rigorous assessment of more than 6,000 public companies with revenue over US$1bn. All companies are scored on applicable metrics relative to their peers, with 50% of the weight assigned to sustainable revenue and sustainable investment. Nine of the indicators have fixed weights; the rest are assigned weights according to each industry’s relative impact in relation to the overall economy. After quantitatively analysing data for 25 key performance indicators, using the Corporate Knights methodology, this year’s overall scores were converted to letter grades.

Ralph Torrie, Corporate Knights’ research director, says rising oil prices have stimulated growth in renewables, smart buildings, electric vehicles and other climate solutions, including circular economy measures. Indeed, the top-ranked company, Schnitzer Steel, is a metals recycler. “Global 100 companies are providing the products and services that are needed for the sustainability transition and that will form the basis of the emerging 21st-century economy,” says Torrie. “They’ve outperformed the market through these last few tumultuous years.”

But while improved productivity scores for carbon, energy, water and other environmental performance indicators are often collateral benefits of underlying megatrends, such as increasing electrification, energy efficiency and digitisation, the improvement in sustainable revenues and investments is generally the result of much more deliberate corporate investment policies and strategic decisions, Torrie says. “Very often, there is visionary leadership from the CEO, and the company has a clear view of the way the world is headed and how to get ahead of it.”","Puma, Adidas improve sustainability rankings in 2023"

But an audio headset where barely-there solar cells blend into the design? Until this week, we’d only ever tried one of those. Now, there are at least four.

On Tuesday, Adidas announced the RPT-02 SOL, a $230 pair of self-charging Bluetooth cans with Exeger’s Powerfoyle solar cells built right into the recycled plastic headband (via Engadget). That’s the same exact solar technology as in the Urbanista Los Angeles solar-powered headphones we reviewed last year, and they also quote the same 80 hours of “reserve” battery life, even in a pitch-black room.

I wouldn’t know it held solar cells unless you told me. Image: Adidas

We haven’t tried the Adidas headset yet, but the solar tech totally worked when my colleague Jon Porter tried it in the Urbanistas. Even indoors, without leaving them to charge in the sun, we saw impressively low battery drain. “The beauty of the Los Angeles headphones is that you don’t really have to think about it,” Jon wrote. Adidas makes no mention of active noise cancellation (something the Los Angeles has) or any fancy audio codecs, but it does have IPX4 water resistance, a microphone, and a USB-C port for backup charging. And Engadget writes that their predecessor, made by Zound, had remarkably good sound.

Urbanista is also now bringing the Powerfoyle panels to a set of true wireless earbuds (well, technically, their charging case), and a company called Blue Tiger also just put what it claims is the “world’s first solar powered communications headset” on sale late last month, again with the Powerfoyle cells and a noise-canceling boom mic. The Blue Tiger Solare costs $220.

I also spotted this upcoming POC Omne Eternal bike helmet, which uses the cells to power a flashing rear safety blinker.

It wasn’t a given that this tech would take off, even to this preliminary degree. JBL crowdfunded a pair of headphones like these on Indiegogo back in 2019 but wound up canceling the project and handing out refunds. Another Indiegogo campaign for solar-powered earbuds by a company named Pearl Audio is currently “under review.”",The Verge

It’s racing season and adidas has recently unveiled new colors of its record-breaking Running lineup.

The Adizero Prime X Strung is relatively new to the market, but it’s quickly gotten rave reviews from runners of all levels. As the first Adizero silhouette to feature a Strung upper, the Prime X Strung delivers a finely-tuned textile informed by athlete data, all without sacrificing comfort and durability. Previous offerings have favored “Pulse Mint” and “Off White” colors, but the latest favors fast “Solar Red” flair.

Underfoot, the long run connoisseur enjoys three layers of Lightstrike Pro foam. Additionally, the cocoon-like upper benefits from the Energyrods housed in-between the cushioning. All together, adidas’ Prime X sole unit makes for a responsive feel that pushes the running industry forward. Lastly, the shoe is made from a minimum of 50% recycled content, an impressive feat considering its unrivaled performance.

Adidas is so confident in its ‘Powerfoyle’ solar charging technology that it ships the Bluetooth RPT-02 SOL headphones without a charging cable.

What could be worse than a charley horse halfway into a run? The answer incessantly beeped in my ear as my wireless earbuds alerted me their time was nigh.

Up to the point, I had a great stride and was cruising on what would be one of my last summer runs. But with my legs outlasting my headphones, that vibe was gone. And I was stuck with the ambient sounds of distant ambulance sirens, nearby road construction, and the “swoo-swee” of my running shorts.

This wasn’t a one-off either. As much as I enjoy running and recreating with music or a podcast, there’s always a chance the battery will die (and having made the jump from corded headphones, I will not go back).

Adidas realized this and this summer offered up a solution: solar-charging headphones. For the last 2 months, I’ve been testing the RPT-02 SOL on-ear headphones.

And in that time, I plugged them to recharge exactly once. The rest of that charge, after near-daily use, came from sunlight. If these seem too good to be true, read on for the full rundown of what I thought.

In short: If you think the idea of wireless Bluetooth headphones that almost never run out of battery sounds like a fallacy, think again. Over the last 8+ weeks of testing, I plugged the RPT-02 SOL in only once to fully recharge. Most of the time, the power drain inside the headphones was either mitigated by sunlight, or the battery actually went up with use. But they aren’t perfect for everything and they come at a high price. So consider these a worthy investment if they match your lifestyle.

adidas RPT-02 SOL Wireless Solar-Charging Headphones Review

I was immediately impressed by these headphones even before putting them on. Opening the box, it was clear adidas wanted to make a big statement — the brand doesn’t even include a charging cable in the package.

That’s right, if these run out of juice, you’d better have a USB-C cable lying around (or wait until morning to use them again). But the message is clear: These really do charge from the sun.

Quick Start

If you’ve used any wireless Bluetooth earbuds or headphones, you’ll probably manage to navigate the RPT-02 SOL intuitively. At the very least, you’ll likely be able to start listening right out of the box.

A control button sits on either side, and these should face backward when worn properly. Your master control rests on the right headphone. This is a “five-way” toggle, so you can press it up, down, left, right, and depress inward.

Up and down control volume, left and right advance or reverse tracks. Pressing the toggle inward controls play/pause, or answers calls.

On the left ear is your “action button.” Despite the name, I rarely used this feature. The button is programmable — sort of — in that you can assign it to play certain Spotify playlists. You cannot assign it to any app you please and, at least in my thorough attempt, it won’t control podcasts.

You can also set this button to perform different functions according to the number of times you press it. So one press will illuminate the built-in light meter to show you how strong the light is. Two presses can launch Spotify, and three will access voice assistant (“call Arlo”).

A quick note on the light meter: I never used this. I figure if I can see the light meter, I can see whether or not it’s bright outside. What’s more, this consists of three concentric rings and is not a precise quantitative measure of the charge — for that, you’ll need the app!

adidas Headphones App

Screenshot of adidas headphone app in action — battery actually going up during use!

You don’t need to download the corresponding headphones app to use or enjoy the headphones. I didn’t at first, and everything worked fine. But after I downloaded the app and paired the headphones, I recommend you do the same.

The app will allow you to customize your action button, set your equalizer according to your preferences, and most importantly, it will show you the battery level and whether your battery is draining or gaining milliamps.

And on a bright, sunny day, you will actually see your battery going up as you use them — wild!

Great for (Some) Activity

Because I’m accustomed to earbuds that rest within the ear, I questioned how much use I’d get from the on-ear RPT-02 SOL. I am happy to report that these headphones do a pretty good job hanging tough during activity.

For trail runs and jogs about town, they stayed put the vast majority of the time. Yes, a couple of times they started to slide back — but that was easy to fix with a little adjustment (the earphones each slide several notches up and down along the headband — and they can be adjusted individually).

I also wore these on the basketball court and found them OK, but not ideal. For serious high-output activities, these will not prove as stable as good earbuds.

On top of this, the headphones carry IPX4 water resistance. You can’t take them swimming and I wouldn’t recommend wearing them in a soaking rain. But they will stand up to sweat during hot days, no problem.

Fit & Feel

While these headphones remained very stable during testing and proved generally comfortable, I found they wore out their welcome after about an hour. These are not true over-the-ear headphones, in that they sit on your ear, but they don’t cover it.

This isn’t a problem for moderate periods of time, but I can marathon a podcast series while catching up on my weekend honey-do list. So, I noticed pressure points along the middle of my ear and tightness around the sides of my head.

Readjusting the fit and placement helped relieve this somewhat, but it has been the main issue for me in testing.

For audiophiles and electrical engineers, here are the gritty details.

While I am not an expert on audio or sound, I’ve used my fair share of headphones. The RPT-02 SOL offers rich, balanced sound — and with customizable EQ, I can fine-tune the experience to my preferences. Zero complaints.

Conclusion: Who Should Buy

If you can swing $229 for a pair of headphones, I think you’ll probably be very happy. That said, if you are willing to spend that much, you may have more distinguished audio preferences than I do.

But if the price is right and longevity is of primary concern, I can just about guarantee you’ll love these headphones. I imagine with the onset of winter, I’ll need to be more mindful of recharging these manually.

But with an 80-hour stored runtime and near-infinite charge in summer, it’s a no-brainer for me. The RPT-02 SOL works great for many of my outdoor activities, and so far works better the more I use them.

Speaking at this year’s Cannes Lions Changemakers series which shines a light on female leaders making a mark on their industry, Free, the Head of Global Marketing at sportswear multinational Adidas, said brands must evolve their strategies to keep up with the growing expectations younger consumers have of companies.

“We know in our industry, we're part of the problem and we have to be a bigger part of the solution. We focus a lot on Gen Z and they really don't want to hear any more about sustainability,” she told Euronews Next.

Customers will hold companies accountable and as a future-focused brand serving conscious consumers, what you do speaks much louder than what you say, Free noted.

“They want to see action. They want to really see, what are you doing? How are you driving it? They want a longer lasting product and they want it to be better for the planet,” she said.

Putting values into action at Adidas

New consumer behaviours have led to fundamental changes in how one of the top sports companies in the world conducts its business and makes decisions.

Sourcing more environmentally friendly materials, reducing plastic in manufacturing and designing apparel that is more durable, for instance, are just some of the ways Adidas is improving sustainability through product innovation.

“We focus a lot on sustainability. It's a core belief at Adidas to create a stronger planet. When we think about sustainability, there's obviously a message that we want to deliver - but behind the message is the action, Free said.

Not only is the company making more sustainable consumer products, it is working on ways to reduce its carbon footprint internally and co-creating these solutions with customers along the way.

“Consumers want to know: how are you putting your values into action? And so that moves marketing upstream and the way we go about change, the way we build our strategy so that it's not at the end of the cycle, but it's actually at the beginning of the cycle,” she said.

In this sense, the Adidas brand has become much more than a model or aesthetics - it is a holistic representation of the entire company’s values, strategic decisions and purpose.

Diversity is key for brands too

Strong, future focused brands not only strive to put sustainable values into action, they also work on embedding diverse teams that represent the full spectrum of communities they serve.

Whilst the marketing and advertising industry is “late to the party,” Free argues, leaders can work on improving representation by cultivating a strong pipeline of talent in every area of a business.

“How to get to the future faster and that’s with the truth. And today our industry does not reflect the communities that we serve globally. Brands are just made of humans,” she said.

By creating the opportunities for different voices and perspectives to be represented in branding decisions, companies are more likely to better understand and connect to their customers beliefs, values and ultimately commercial choices.

So, how does a company know if it's building a strong, future focused brand? The true indicator is what consumers share voluntarily with others.

“It’s what the community is saying to each other. This tells us who's winning, who's meaningful, and who is truly innovative. And that's what we're focused on,” she said.

Kanye West is yet again a trending topic on Twitter. Adidas/Yeezy employees reported to Rolling Stone that Kanye West played pornographic videos in meetings and showed intimate photos of his ex-wife, Kim Kardashian, during job interviews. Former employees also say West used “mind games” to bully them.

Over two dozen former employees have come forth to admit that the culture in the office was abusive.

Now folks are taking to Twitter to speculate how long Adidas knew about this and allowed it to go on. Many are claiming that West’s behavior was probably excused because of his status. Some are even taking it as far as to say that Adidas may have been aware but swept the entire situation under the rug.

One of the statements in the article comes from an employee hired around the time West first transferred Yeezy from Adidas to Nike (2013). And several more came after this.

All of this information is surfacing just weeks after Adidas cut ties with and ended its shoe partnership with West.

Neither Kanye West nor Adidas has made any statements concerning the allegations yet. So as for now, it is uncertain whether Adidas was aware of these incidents or not.","Kanye West Allegedly Created An Inappropriate Work Environment At Adidas, How Long Did Adidas Allow It?"

In a statement Fili said, “Charging – everyone hates it. But every time you don’t charge [using main electricity] it is a good thing for the world. The new generation of young adults expects to be offered the tools to do good [for the environment], and that is what we are offering.""

The solar panels that Exeger makes are called Powerfoyle and they are just 1.3 mm thick. The technology they use is based on strips of titanium dioxide covered in a natural dye. In very simple terms, the dye absorbs photons of light, which are then transitioned into electrons.

While Powerfoyle’s panels are only half as efficient as the standard silicon-based solar panels, of the same size in the same amount of full sunlight, the titanium dioxide panels are, in addition much easier and cheaper to produce, while being significantly thinner.

There is a battery in the solar-powered headphones, that is charged from the solar panels, and gets up to 80 hours of playback time. Mr. Fili states that solar charging can produce one hour’s worth of power “from just 20 minutes of English or Swedish sunshine.”",Solar-powered headphones are the next must-have gadget

The Adidas Football x Parley Boot Pack uses ocean plastic, re-imagined plastic waste, intercepted on remote islands, beaches, coastal communities and shorelines to produce the shoes and prevent the materials from polluting the ocean.

""Boasting stunning lucid blue and white colourways and elegant wave-patterned designs spanning all of its key boot franchises - Predator Accuracy, X Speedportal and Copa Pure - the new pack strengthens adidas commitment to contributing to help reduce plastic waste,"" read an Adidas statement.

""Continuing to deliver the best for the athlete on the pitch while striving to make a difference off of it, the footwear drop is the latest chapter of a journey started in 2015 when adidas first partnered with Parley for the Oceans and saw the opportunity to turn a problem into performance by integrating Parley Ocean Plastic across a number of football apparel jerseys.

""While not the solution for saving our oceans, this innovation represents the brand's commitment towards replacing virgin polyester with recycled solutions by 2024 wherever possible.""

The Predator Accuracy boots are available for £230 ($280/€260), while the X Speedportal and Copa Pure items are priced at £230 and £220 ($265/€250), respectively, for the most expensive versions while cheaper alternatives of each are also on sale.

Running shoes, sweatshirts, shorts, hoodies, t-shirts, water bottles, sweatpants and leggings are also available in the collaboration with Parley for the Oceans.

Adidas is facing its first annual loss in three decades after ending its nine-year partnership with Ye, the American rapper formerly known as Kanye West.

The German sportswear brand split with the 45-year-old last October after he made several antisemitic remarks on social media, resulting in the end of Yeezy-branded products.

It is reported that the Yeezy range accounted for eight per cent of Adidas' total sales in 2021 after generating $2 billion (£1.6 billion/€1.8 billion) that year.

Bjørn Gulden, the new chief executive of Adidas, said it had yet to decide what to do with the unsold stock of Yeezy products which is reportedly worth around $1.3 billion (£1.1 billion/€1.2 billion).

If Adidas opts to dispose of the products, it could see the company’s profit drop by $500 million (£414 million/€468 million) and suffer its first annual operating loss in 31 years.",Adidas launches boots made of ocean plastic to prevent pollution

Adding to the shoe’s innovative comfort properties, ECCO FLUIDFORM Direct Comfort Technology ensures a finely tuned balance of cushioning and rebound that creates an integral and durable bond without the compromises common with stitched and/or glued assemblies. As such, despite its traditional look, the CLASSIC HYBRID still provides the wearer with a lightweight, flexible feel.

“The unique and exciting designs throughout this collection, whether it’s a brand-new product or an update to one of our all-time favorites, will appeal to a wide range of golfers,” said Jesper Thuen, General Manager, ECCO GOLF USA. “Finding a pair of golf shoes that fits your style is important, but what sets our shoes apart can only be experienced when they are worn.”

Brands selected are done so for their work championing sustainability best practice in all aspects of their work. Only in its second year, the Laureus Sport for Good Index is a collaboration between Laureus, the global organisation that aims to make green changes using sport as a vehicle, and events company SportsPro.

The index exists “to celebrate brands that align with Laureus’ messages around sustainability and making a difference.”

Rapha’s citation in the index read: “Some of the company’s most impactful work has been carried out by the Rapha Foundation, which was established in 2019 and now funds more than 20 organisations globally that support riders from under-represented communities.

“On top of its charitable efforts, Rapha also has a commitment to be carbon neutral by 2025 and – as a member of the Sustainable Apparel Coalition – is working towards a 45 per cent reduction in collective emissions by 2030.”

Rapha were one of many brands included which, according to SportsPro commercial director Paul Guest, use their position “to drive positive environmental and social progress across the United Nations 17 sustainable development goals”.

Francois Convercey, the new co-managing director of Rapha said that the brand was humbled to make the selection.

“Rapha exists to inspire the world to live life by bike and we're proud to be able to contribute to changing the face of cycling by making it more inclusive, serving underrepresented communities around the world and making our business as sustainable as the sport it serves,"" Convercey said.

""We're humbled to be in the company of many other game-changer brands and hope that together, we will continue to drive a positive impact through sport.""

Last week, Convercey became joint co-managing director of the brand along with another long standing Rapha employee Daniel Blumire.

It is striving to be a leading figure in a more sustainable future.

Part of this launch involved Jess Fox, Ian Thorpe, Nathan Cleary, and Steph Claire Smith debuting a sustainable floating tennis court composed of ocean plastic at the 2022 Australian Open. Adidas made the floating court also to raise awareness about marine plastic pollution.

The athletes played tennis on the marine barge along the Great Barrier Reef to draw attention to the importance of ocean cleanup and pollution prevention.

After the event, the tennis court was repurposed into a sports court and donated to a Townsville school. The firm wishes to inspire schoolchildren to unite through athletics and create a more sustainable world.

Ian Thorpe, an Adidas ambassador, and swimmer said he’s proud to be a partner in this cause. He said:

“The design of the new Adidas tennis range made with Parley Ocean Plastic is inspired by the Great Barrier Reef, so it was appropriately launched in the stunning heritage-protected Queensland marine park today to raise awareness and positive discussion around how we can help end plastic waste. It was a day that none of us will ever forget. Plastic is a problem that has reached unfathomable proportions: unless we change course, there will be more plastic waste in the sea than fish by 2050. This waste is destroying the oceans.”

It is hoped that the floating event will spark a good dialogue about the necessity of eliminating plastic waste and protecting the oceans from further degradation.

Shannon Morgan, Senior Director of Brand at Adidas Pacific, commented on the new collection:

“At Adidas, we believe through sport we have the power to change lives. We live this purpose every day by looking at all possibilities to include and unite people in sport to help create a more sustainable world. We need to continue to implement sustainable solutions now so that we can help create a new era of sport for future generations. We are committed to helping end plastic waste, and by 2024, we will replace virgin polyester in our products with recycled polyester wherever possible. To achieve these goals, we foster open-source partnerships and put a high value on collaboration over the competition to create sustainable solutions that go beyond our own business and influence.”

In recent years, Australia has seen a slew of climate change-related natural disasters, including bushfires, ozone layer depletion, and the continued contamination of single-use plastic, which has contributed to the Great Barrier Reef’s destruction. Rising global emissions is the other Great Barrier Reef destroyer; they cause global warming, which causes ocean temperatures to rise, resulting in mass bleaching events.

So, launching this collection and hosting the floating tennis court in Australia seems natural. This way, the country not only sees the effects of environmental deterioration but also the possibility of recovery.",Adidas Creates Floating Tennis Court Made of Ocean Plastic to Raise Awareness

Newton Heath. But make it neon.

Man Utd unveiled their new third kit for 2022-23, revealing a luminous, never before seen all-over green. Following on from this season's previous releases, adidas look to pay homage to legacy kits of the past while taking a bold step with a fresh design.

For the first time in club history, adidas introduce a striking new interpretation of the classic club colour for an eye-catching all-over 'Solar Slime' jersey. The colour green has long had strong connotations with the history of Man Utd. Still, we've never seen it done like this, and we have seen a lot.

As a club with a strong visual identity, it's no surprise we see a geometric pattern take centre stage both on the collar and the shirt itself. Drawing inspiration from the fashion culture of 90s Zeitgeist, the crewneck collar is dressed in a statement graphic, finishing off the striking design nicely.

Ahead of the release Inigo Turner, Design Director at adidas, spoke of the new kit as ""a convergence of cultural icons remixed and recoded, the 22/23 third kit takes its inspiration from the iconic Manchester United graphic identity, using geometric shapes and patterns.""

""Good players create time and space. Great ones leave them both behind. Unlock multidimensional speed in adidas X Speedportal. Sleek and super-comfortable, these football boots support instant reactions with a springy, full-length Carbitex carbon plate on their firm ground outsole.""

The football boots come in a laceless style, with the upper being constructed out of PRIMEKNIT material. The shoe includes EVA inserts on the inside of the boot, whereas the lightweight carbon heel locks on the outside sole, which keeps you stable during light-speed play.

The boots' upper features Speedskin 2.0, which is a laceless lightweight upper that guarantees comfort. The textured pattern over the boot helps by securing more direct contact with the ball.

Football boots inculcate a high-speed stability system, with the feature of a support cage and stability wing, which keep your feet locked in, so you can easily opt for dynamic multi-directional movements with absolute freedom.

Lastly, the outsole comes in a speedframe 2.0 design. The frame of the outsole promises acceleration, and when combined with the stud design, it improves traction as well.

Interestingly, the cleats are made with a series of recycled materials, with the upper constructed of at least 50% recycled content. The product represents the three stripe label's solutions to help end plastic waste. Other unique features of the boots include laceless construction, molded midfoot support, and carbon heel lock.

In the recent game between Croatia and Brazil for the Quarter finals on December 9, 2022, the center-back Joško Gvardiol was seen wearing X Speedportal ""Solar Green"" model. For the match, Gvardiol made a small adjustment by wrapping the midfoot in tape, which helped the player increase the lockdown of the foot.

The boots can be availed on the official e-commerce site of Adidas and select retailers at a price of $280.

And with those hopes may also come the desire to find hiking footwear suited for all-day weekend excursions into the woods. The ideal hiking shoes are light enough not to tire the feet after a few hours of traversing rocks, sands, and the innumerable surfaces across a trail, waterproof, offer a confident grip, and preferably look great while doing it. The adidas TERREX Free Hiker 2 is designed to check off all these marks.

The adidas TERREX Free Hiker 2’s footstrike ride is cushioned and almost airy, a characteristic credited to the Boost technology on which the hikers ride upon for an energy return feel that should add at least a few more miles without having to succumb to fatigue.

adidas has also given the Free Hiker 2’s a grippy traction outsole constructed with Continental rubber. When tested, the abrasion-resistance reinforcements and a molded toe cap design across a local trail with slippery rocks and dusty clay paths local to our area did well to maintain its composure switching between dry and wet surfaces, agile and lightweight.

While climbing around a small canyon dam over the weekend, we were also able to test out the weatherproof and breathable waterproof Gore-Tex membrane version. The adidas TERREX Free Hiker 2 aren’t really intended for deep backwoods hiking, but for a creek crossing pair of kicks or summit-reaching day trips, they’ll keep your feet dry and less fatigued.

We recommend the Free Hiker 2 for those who prefer hiking footwear with a more cushioned and lightweight feel. The TERREX Free Hiker 2 (above) and Free Hiker 2 Gore-Tex (below) silhouettes are available now for $200 and $230 respectively. Note the Free Hiker 2’s more sock-like design, with the Gore-Tex iteration adopting a more boot-like structure to keep water from soaking socks and feet.

Though on the precipice of releasing yet another new silhouette with adidas, Pharrell and his team have not yet moved on from the NMD S1 RYAT. As revealed by way of official images, the outdoors-inspired silhouette is about to see a brand new colorway, which consists of both “Core Black” and “Solar Red.”

Said “Solar Red” is met with more muted hits of purple and blue, all three of which come together in celebration of hiking gear. But these, though focal to the design’s overarching themes, are relegated to the Pharrell x adidas NMD S1 RYAT’s accents. “Core Black” is used much more comprehensively, applied to the construction’s suedes, leathers, and rubberized TPU mudguards. Even the laces and sole unit are done up in the same neutral, rounding out a look that’s only a few touches away from “Triple Black.”

For a closer look at this brand new Pharrell x adidas NMD S1 RYAT, see below. A release date has been confirmed for October 15th, 2022, available through the adidas Confirmed App.

But you know, and I know, that it takes more than talent to do what you’ve accomplished,” tennis legend Stan Smith said as he presented Adidas with the Sustainability Leadership Award at the 35th annual FN Achievement Awards Tuesday night.

“Starting with founder Adi Dassler, Adidas has always emphasized the functionality of sport, and more recently in fashion, in designing shoes,” Smith added. “And over the years, they’ve been committed to sustainability. Adidas has been using my shoe as the lead on this initiative to, among other things, help in reducing plastic waste in the world by using more recycled materials.”

He went on to mention the collaboration Adidas released with Disney featuring some of its “green characters” to emphasize the line’s more sustainable approach. (He happened to be was wearing the Kermit the Frog Stan Smith sneaker.)

Like many fashion and footwear players, Adidas has set a goal for its entire supply chain to be carbon neutral by 2050 in support of the targets outlined in the Paris Agreement that aim to curb rising global temperatures and the resulting climate change.

While 2050 seems far away, Adidas isn’t moving slow to reach its goal. In fact, the company has set a more-aggressive deadline of 2025 to reach carbon neutrality for its own operations, and to reduce the carbon emissions of its products by 15%. By that year, it also aims for nine out of 10 products to be sustainable (right now, six out of 10 are).

Caroline Lew-Wolf, vice president of business development for Adidas North America, accepted the award last night on behalf of the company. She mentioned recent extreme weather cases around the country and emphasized that third world nations are even more impacted.

“We have to do more, think bigger, and think differently. We need to do better,” Lew-Wolf said. “At Adidas, we are committed to ending plastic waste, creating a more sustainable world by creating products with recycled materials, with products that are made to be remade and products that are made of natural materials.”

Lew-Wolf added: “There’s a lot more that we have to do as a company and as an industry. So, let’s all keep pushing the boundaries of what’s possible because we know this is bigger than sports. We know this is bigger than sneakers. It’s the right thing to do for our people, our communities and for our planet.”

Below is an article from the magazine’s Nov. 29 print issue about its latest eco-minded projects.

At Adidas, the drive to improve its environmental impact has become an integral part of its business — at every level. “We have teams fully dedicated to sustainability and identifying new technologies, innovations, materials, designs and processes that are sustainable,” said Caroline Lew-Wolf, VP of business development for Adidas North America. Like many fashion and footwear players, the company has set a goal for its entire supply chain to be carbon neutral by 2050, in support of the targets outlined in the Paris Agreement that aim to curb rising global temperatures and the resulting climate change.

But if you think that 30-year timeframe means Adidas is moving slow, you’re wrong. It also has set a more-aggressive deadline of 2025 to reach carbon neutrality for its own operations, and to reduce the carbon emissions of its products by 15%. By that year, it also aims for nine out of 10 products to be sustainable (right now, six out of 10 are).

The company’s efforts have already earned it high marks with consumers. In an April survey of nearly 5,000 men and women globally, conducted by Stifel and Morning Consult, Adidas scored in the top five among all active/casual brands, based on its environmental sustainability, ethical business practices and community stewardship.

“Adidas has been a real thought leader in the area of sustainability,” said Stifel analyst Jim Duffy. He noted that awareness of the brand’s efforts is strongest in Europe, opening up opportunity for the North America division to further broadcast its eco-friendly mission among consumers.

Here, Lew-Wolf identifies five initiatives in 2021 that advanced the brand’s sustainability goals.

Choose to Give Back

“This fall with ThredUp, we launched the Adidas Choose to Give Back program to extend the product lifecycle. Consumers can send us used product from any brand via the Adidas Creators Club and it will be reused or resold,” said Lew-Wolf. That launch marked Adidas’ first foray into the rapidly growing resale business.

Adidas x Allbirds

Few collaborations this year generated quite as much excitement as this union between competitors. “Last year with Allbirds, we announced our ambition to create a performance running shoe with no carbon footprint. This year, we introduced Futurecraft.Footprint — each pair has just 2.94 kilograms of carbon dioxide and is created with 63% less emissions than a comparable running shoe,” she said.

Parley for the Oceans

This year, Adidas unveiled two new styles from its ongoing collaboration: the Ultraboost 21 x Parley, a performance shoe featuring an upper made in part with Primeblue, a high-performance recycled yarn containing 50% Parley Ocean Plastic; and the Ultraboost 6.0 DNA x Parley, also created with Primeblue as well as recycled plastics (20% of which comes from reprocessed fishing nets). “With Parley for the Oceans, we collect and recycle plastic waste found on beaches and in coastal regions before it gets to the oceans, then we transform it into high-performance sportswear. This year, we’ll produce 17 million pairs of shoes using plastic waste intercepted from beaches and coastal communities. We’ve created 30 million pairs since our partnership began in 2015,” said Lew-Wolf.

Made to Be Remade

“On Earth Day, we launched the Ultraboost DNA Made to be Remade. Once it’s worn out, consumers can return it to us, then we’ll grind it up and remake it into something new,” said Lew-Wolf. Since then, the brand has quickly expanded on the Made to be Remade initiative, rolling out a version of the classic Stan Smith made entirely of TPU, as well as a Terrex hiker and apparel.

Stan Smith Mylo

Recently, fashion labels have explored using mushroom-based leather alternatives to make handbags, but Adidas broke new ground with footwear this year. “We partnered with Bolt Threads for their natural Mylo material, made with mycelium, the root-like structure from mushrooms. This spring, we introduced our Stan Smith Mylo,” said Lew-Wolf. “We expect to have a commercially available proof of concept in the near future.”

At the center of the many wings of the 1,500-square meter space is the 12-meter tunnel, woven out of rattan and rising improbably among the white tiles and grayed out concrete of the flagship store. You could admire it from afar, or take a walk inside, and watch the videos playing on the displays mounted along the inside, educating you on adidas’ central advocacy: the plastic floating in the oceans.

MORE FROM SPIN MORE FROM SPIN

It could have been so easy for adidas to just take that space and use it to push even more product. “This was an area that we looked at and said we could put a long footwear wall… or we could do something with it,” said Anthony Frangos, general manager of adidas Philippines.

“But really, being that it was the center point of the store, we wanted to use the space to elevate and create awareness around marine plastic pollution.”

Adidas wants to educate consumers about sustainability

It’s been a central advocacy of the brand, globally, for the past few years, he added — and one that is particularly resonant for the Philippines.

“As a nation, as a country, we're made up of so many islands, surrounded by water and pollution and particularly plastic pollution in the oceans. It’s such a big topic,” explained Frangos.

He added: “We felt that it would be great to be able to amplify what the brand has been doing for so many years now and bring it to the Philippines.”

Beyond the giant installation at its center, the store itself will live up to the ethos of sustainability, and educate customers about the alternative choices that would better the environment.

Frangos said, “There are different choices to single-use plastic and we're providing some of that through the Maker Lab, the carry weight bags, and soon, you know, I'm very hopeful we'll be able to announce very local collaboration with an NGO that just helps us continue this story.”

And of course, the different adidas collaborations with the environmental organization Parley for the Oceans — like the UltraBoost 21 x Parley — will also be for sale.

But of course, the Three Stripes is looking to integrate more recyclable material into its various platforms, or even baking it into the way they work.

“The company really has looked at all elements of our range. So this year 60 percent of our range will be made from sustainable materials,” Frangos promised. “Seventeen million shoes will be made from recycled plastic waste from the oceans.”

Even though more than 90 per cent of adidas Golf apparel in its spring/summer range is made in part with recycled materials, they wanted to make a special collection to inspire others to join them on their journey to help End Plastic Waste.

This PLAY GREEN Collection, comprised of polos, t-shirts, and hats, brings versatile style and performance through products made in part with recycled materials.

adidas Golf's main goal is to replace all virgin polyester with recycled polyester in their products by 2024 wherever possible. The colours from the PLAY GREEN Collection were specifically curated based on the landscapes that golfers encounter over the course of their rounds.

The Spray-Dyed Polo, for example, features colours inspired by the vibrant green of the fairways, brushed whites of the clouds, contrasted whites and browns of the bunkers, and the dark blues of the ocean and waters often found around the course.

As a way to identify this special collection, adidas Golf created an inspiring emblem that combines golf with the mission as a brand to help End Plastic Waste.

This playful design features a plastic bottle holding golf clubs on a pushcart, encouraging all to consider the many ways everyone can do more to respect our environment.

""It’s always our objective to make products for golfers that perform, but we never lose sight of the need to do so in a more sustainable way,"" said Shaun Madigan, global director of apparel, adidas Golf.

""PLAY GREEN is a collection where we feature designs inspired by the natural beauty that’s unique to golf, but all on a canvas comprised of materials that are better for the environment.""

The PLAY GREEN Collection is available now at adidas.com, the adidas app and at select retailers worldwide.

Adidas is targeting online sales of up to 9 billion euros ($10.7 billion) a year by 2025 with an operating profit margin of 12-14%, up from the 11.3% achieved in 2019 before the coronavirus crisis knocked sales and profitability.

The company has reopened 95% of its stores after coronavirus lockdowns, it said on Wednesday, as it forecast a 2021 sales growth rate in the mid-to-high teens, rising to as much as 30% in greater China, the rest of Asia and Latin America.

Adidas shares were up 3.2% by 1250 GMT, the biggest gain on the German blue-chip index.

While the sporting goods industry has suffered from store closures during the COVID-19 pandemic, it has managed to sell more online as more people have taken up running, hiking and yoga during lockdowns.

Nike, the world’s biggest sportswear brand, has said people have logged on to its workout and store apps en masse, driving significantly higher online sales over the past year.

Adidas will invest more than 1 billion euros in its digital transformation by 2025, including making its supply chain more agile to better deliver online orders quickly.

Slideshow ( 4 images )

CEO Kasper Rorsted said e-commerce would account for more than 40% of the industry’s sales by 2025, with online growing three times faster than offline. Adidas has already attracted more than 150 million members to its online programme.

It will also spend 1 billion euros more in 2025 compared to 2021 on the brand, including on marketing and sponsorship as it launches sports-inspired lifestyle products, alongside its existing performance and Originals fashion categories.

Like rivals Puma and Nike, Adidas will put a bigger focus on the women’s market, announcing a partnership with Peloton, which has seen a surge of subscribers during the pandemic for its on-demand workout programmes on exercise bikes.

It aims to make nine out of 10 products more sustainable by 2025, using more recycled and biodegradable materials, with its Stan Smith tennis shoe leading the way with a version made of mushroom-based leather substitute set to launch later in 2021.

Rorsted said more than 70% of consumers say sustainability is an important consideration when making a purchase.

With greater China set to be its fastest growth market, Adidas will now manage the region separately from the rest of Asia.

Net income from continuing operations is projected to rise to 1.25-1.45 billion euros in 2021, up from 429 million euros in 2020 but still below the 1.9 billion euros in 2019.

Adidas expects a hit of about 250 million euros to operating profit from costs to make its struggling Reebok brand a standalone company as it prepares to sell or spin-off the business, with a third of that in 2022 but none in 2023.

More than that, waiting for them to finally charge can take an eternity and throw your flawless, systematic morning routine out the window.

Enter the Adidas RPT-02 SOL, a pair of self-charging headphones that are powered by light. The use of Powerfoyle technology transforms natural and artificial light into energy that will keep the battery level at 100 per cent - no pesky wires necessary.

Pretty impressive, right? We decided to put this bold claim to the test and see if they were as game-changing as they appear by spending every waking moment blasting our (late 90s, early 2000s-dominated) playlist.

Read on to find out our verdict.

Design

On first look, you can tell right away that these headphones are well designed and as soon as you place them on your head, the comfort sets in. There’s plenty of padding around the ear, and the headband can be slightly adjusted. Despite such a hard-wearing construction, they are incredibly lightweight and after wearing them for a few minutes you can easily forget that they are even there.

Adidas

Reading more into the design, the sustainability credentials are impressive. Similar to many new Adidas clothing lines, the negative environmental impact has been significantly reduced. Built from 87 per cent recycled plastics, and featuring no cables, these headphones are some of the most sustainable on the market.

Features

The most stand out feature is of course the Powerfoyle technology that powers the headphones solely through light. As all forms of light, including artificial light, can top up battery levels, you don’t need to be reliant on the temperamental British weather to provide a source of energy.

I tried out the headphones in various locations with different levels of lighting including eating lunch in a brightly lit living room, a jog through the park on a cloudy morning and an evening stroll at sunset. Throughout all of these tests, the battery life impressively remained at 100 per cent.

Adidas

But for the true test, I needed to find out how quickly the battery life would drain, so I put through their paces in total darkness. I drew all the curtains, boiled the kettle and set in for a Saturday night in-in with a cuppa and an audiobook (Becoming by Michelle Obama - if you must know). A few hours later, the battery level had barely shifted and when exposed to light again, they charged up in just 30 minutes. Offering 80 hours of stored playtime, you’ll never have to worry about battery life again.

For the next gruelling assessment, I tried them out during an intense hour workout and they proved to be a great gym companion - the IPX4-rated design makes them entirely sweat and splash proof. The inner headband and ear cushions are also removable and washable so you can either wipe them down or put them on a quick wash so they’re fresh for your next wear. They aren’t entirely noise cancelling, but the volume levels can be adjusted to block out much of the background noise.

To get the most out of this product, it is worth downloading the Adidas Headphones app. Through the easy-to-use interface, you can conveniently control and customise features like sound levels.

Verdict

Adidas has well and truly shaken up the headphone market - the innovative technology is highly impressive and no doubt other companies will follow with more solar-powered tech.

Over a weekend of usage, the battery was barely drained and they automatically charged up at the feintest exposure to natural or artificial light. With the rise in energy bills, we’re grateful to have one less thing to need to constantly charge up.",Adidas Headphones RPT-02 SOL review: the latest solar-powered tech

Similarly, through adidas’ global impact initiative Run for the Oceans, the brand aims to urgently address the devastating marine plastic pollution in our oceans, encouraging runners and the world to make a difference. In its fifth year, more activities than ever will be eligible for Run for the Oceans, with the introduction of tennis, wheelchair movement, football and more. For every 10 minutes of running recorded via the adidas Runtastic app, Parley will clean up the equivalent weight of one plastic bottle from beaches, remote islands, and coastlines before it reaches the ocean (up to a maximum of 250,000kg).

The Route

Lee Ryan and Ghani Souleymane ran for approximately 17 hours covering a total of 118 kilometers. The run started at Al Khawaneej and ended in Bluewaters. Dubai Can supported the runners as they visited 36 refill stations throughout their running route.

This initiative is more than just a run. It is an event that will inspire and empower residents of Dubai to unite around a common goal through sport and help drive Dubai Can and adidas’ mission to end plastic waste with the ambition of mobilising a generation to help end plastic waste.

“I am running for the oceans to show my children and my adidas Runners community that nothing is impossible”, said adidas Runners Captain Lee Ryan.

adidas Runners crew runner Ghani Souleymane commented on this initiative saying:” I am running to make a difference in the world paving the way for the next generation to enjoy running and believe they can also do it.”

Let’s make the impossible possible and help us end plastic waste for the city of Dubai. From May 23 – June 8, you can support this intitative by downloading the adidas running app and clocking in your minutes of activity from select activities, such as running, tennis, football, etc.

Published every week, this series charts how businesses and sustainability professionals are working to achieve their ‘Mission Possible’ across the campaign’s five key pillars – energy, resources, infrastructure, mobility and business leadership.

As the dust settles on COP26, businesses are keen to show that they can turn environmental ambitions into actions – potentially moving further and faster than national governments. Here, we round up five positive sustainability stories from this week for the last edition of this article for 2021.

ENERGY: Green light for solar farms in Essex and Oxfordshire

As the UK works to end unabated fossil fuel electricity generation by 2035, more renewables will need to come online. As such, it’s good to see that two solar parks have this week been granted planning permission.

Tuesday (21 December) saw Rochford District Council granted planning consent to British Solar Renewables (BSR) for the development of a solar park, co-located with utility-scale battery storage, on low-grade farmland. There will be a 25MW battery and 24.9MW of solar generation capacity at Fambridge Solar Park. There were no objections to the plans at the meeting, following an extensive consultation period with local groups throughout 2020.

BSR is planning to begin construction in 2022. It is targeting a biodiversity net gain of 58% in the solar park’s first year of operations.

BSR’s chief executive Tim Humpage said: “We are delighted that Rochford District Council recognises that urgent action needs to be taken to address climate change. It is well-considered projects like Fambridge Solar Park and those that will follow it, which will be critical to ensuring energy security and achieving the UK’s commitment to a net-zero future.”

Separately, South Oxford District Council’s planning committee also met on Tuesday and granted planning consent to developer Low Carbon for a 49.9MW solar farm on land at Harlesford Farm, near Tetsworth. The array will be developed across 78 hectares of land and sheep and lambs will be able to graze around the solar panels.

RESOURCES: Princes cuts food waste by more than 12% year-on-year

Multinational food and drink manufacturer Princes has this week published food waste data for its global operations. Princes is perhaps best known for its brands including Napolina, Flora and Branston.

The report reveals a 12.84% year-on-year reduction in total food waste production across the firm’s global operations. Of the food waste that was generated, more than 65% was used to produce animal feed. A further 29.6% was sent to anaerobic digestion plants for use in energy production. No food is sent to landfills in the UK, due to partnerships with charities including FareShare, for distribution.

Princes is notably working to align with the UN’s Sustainable Development Goal 12.3, which entails halving food waste per capita across the world. Other businesses supporting SDG 12.3 include Aldi, Arla, Danone and Tesco.

“As one of the UK’s leading grocery brands and food and drink manufacturers, we have a clear responsibility to address the issue of food waste from farm to fork, and take it very seriously,” said Princes’ corporate relations director David McDiarmid.

“In the last year, we have continued to make good progress across our global operations, during what was of course a very challenging year for colleagues at our sites. This work is very much ongoing, as we continue to explore all opportunities to accelerate further action to reduce waste, and ensure that whatever we have is re-purposed.”

MOBILITY: Kwik Fit owner purchases tyre recycling firm

In this part of the Sustainability Success Stories roundup, we often highlight a new electric vehicle (EV) model or a charging point installation scheme. But there is more to sustainable transport than electrification, including considerations of modal shift and the circular economy.

To this latter point, around 55 million used tyres are disposed of every year in the UK. They are not biodegradable and are a fire and pollution risk.

This week, the parent company of Kwik Fir, ETEL, has confirmed the acquisition of UK-based tyre recycling firm Murfitts, which has the capacity to recycle around 20 million tyres every year. Recycled tyres are used to produce rubber granulate products such as artificial sports pitches and carpet underlay.

“This acquisition makes clear strategic sense as we can bring the responsible collection, processing and re-manufacturing of tyre material under our own roof,” said ETEL’s chief executive Sean Tanaka.

“This will ensure that customers, both retail and wholesale, can be confident that their used tyres are being processed in the most sustainable way possible.”

THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT: CDL has 1.5C science-based targets approved

After setting a 2030 net-zero target, City Developments Limited (CDL) has set stricter emissions reductions targets and had them verified in line with 1.5C by the Science-Based Targets Initiative (SBTi).

CDL was the first real estate company in Singapore to set verified science-based targets in 2018, aligning them with 2C. It promised to increase targets in line with 1.5C when it announced a net-zero vision in February 2021.

You can read edie’s full story, including what the new targets entail, by clicking here.

“To tackle the climate emergency, businesses must set ambitious science-based targets and clear decarbonisation pathways,” said CDL’s chief sustainability officer Esther An.

“Having set our net-zero carbon goals under the WorldGBC Net Zero Carbon Buildings Commitment and having strengthened our SBTi targets, we will remain committed to driving green building innovations in the urgent pursuit of a low-carbon future, while creating value for our business and stakeholders.”

BUSINESS LEADERSHIP: Allbirds and Adidas debut innovative low-carbon trainers

The average running shoe has a carbon footprint of 13.6kg of CO2e, when you account for design, materials, manufacturing, transport and packaging. Keen to change that, Adidas and Allbirds have been working together to develop the world’s lowest-carbon trainers.

Following the launch of a prototype pair with a footprint of less than 3kg in May, the two shoe brands have this month launched the shoe online and at selected stores. 10,000 pairs of the shoes are being made available in the first instance, ahead of the lunch of four new colourways in the first half of 2022.

The shoes, called the FUTURECRAFT.FOOTPRINT, are lighter weight than usual trainers and have fewer components. Adidas and Allbirds have not revealed full details about the materials used but have stated that they are using only natural, low-carbon options, like Allbirds’ sugarcane-based SweetFoam cushioning. They have also stated that the shoe is just as durable as their traditional lines.

While goal No. 1 on the course is to “keep the ball in play,” adidas is extending this mantra beyond the golf ball.

The Made To Be Remade Polo is made with the intention to remake the polo into something new once it reaches the end of its use. The way it works is that the polo is meant to be worn, worn out, and then returned to adidas, who will then grind it, shred it, and convert into something new.

In other words, the end of one product is the beginning of the next, with no compromise on performance. Golfers can keep it in play for as long as they wish and then return it to us so that the materials can one day be used again.

Jennie Ko, Director of Apparel Design, adidas Golf said:

“Our intention with the Made To Be Remade Polo is to invite the wearer into this circular product process, from creation to recreation… Golfers will still benefit by getting a product that performs on the course but will also have the opportunity to limit a product’s impact on the environment.”

While Made To Be Remade products have been released across other categories within the adidas brand, this is the first time it is being featured in golf. adidas approached the design of this polo in the same way they always have: to construct and use materials that promote mobility in the golf swing and feel good on the body. To make this one special, adidas implemented a customized jacquard pattern with fully looped yarns inspired by the continuous loop motion of all Made to be Remade products.

The polo will be offered in two limited-edition colorways—Crew Navy and Semi Turbo—and will come with a special QR code tag located near the hem on the right-hand side. Once this QR code is scanned, it will take the wearer to the Made To Be Remade digital hub. It’s here where they can start their return once they’ve gotten the most out of the polo, learn more about adidas’ sustainability commitments as a brand, and explore other Made To Be Remade products. In order to give wearers enough time to wear down the polo, the return for remaking process will open 100 days after purchase.

The Made To Be Remade Polo is currently available, but exclusively to members of adidas’ adiClub, which is free to join. Members can purchase the Made To Be Remade polo on adidas.com and the adidas app. It will be available in men’s sizing to start, with women’s options available later this year.

For decades, big brands have been leaving a huge carbon footprint, with six billion pairs produced annually — 90 per cent of which end up in landfill and take up to 1,000 years to degrade.

That is why the biggest names have spent vast sums on glossy adverts featuring beautiful people in beautiful locations wearing “eco” goods made with recycled materials.

But a new documentary on Channel 4 on Monday reveals how it is merely “greenwashing” designed to make the likes of Nike and Adidas more money — and far from reducing the production of plastic, they could actually be boosting it.

Reporter Darcy Thomas said: “With consumers more environmentally aware than ever, trainer brands have promised to clean up their act. Slick promos create a vision of an eco-friendly future.

“When it comes to protecting the environment, every trainer brand promises the earth, but there are no easy solutions — except maybe buying fewer trainers.”

‘Degraded by the sun’

The UK now spends nearly £4billion a year on trainers and the average person here owns seven pairs.

Dispatches documentary The Truth About Nike And Adidas shows how the big names suggest our hunger for trainers is not just the problem but the solution.

Adidas boasts in adverts about creating footwear — costing £75 a pair — using plastics that have been retrieved from our polluted seas by environmental group Parley For The Oceans.

But Darcy worked out that less than 20 per cent of the upper part of the trainers in its Parley collection is made from recycled plastic — and little of it actually comes from the ocean.

He said: “Parley does collect some plastic that’s been washed up on the beach. But most of this plastic can’t be made into trainers because it’s too degraded by the sun and the sea.

“It says the plastic is intercepted from beaches and coastal communities before it reaches the oceans.

“In other words, this is plastic that ‘might’ have ended up in the ocean.”

As part of the investigation, Darcy travelled to the Maldives, where the Parley venture is based due to the island nation’s significance in the global marine ecosystem.

One of the country’s environmental campaigners, plastics expert Afrah Ismail, said: “The greenwashing element is there because you’re saying it’s ocean plastic and, to the layman, that essentially means it comes from the ocean.”

In fact, he discovered that in some cases the Parley organisation was getting its plastics direct from tourist resorts in the Maldives, where plastic bottles of all shapes and sizes are liberally used in its bars and restaurants.

He travelled to one of its biggest resorts and discovered that it was part of the same business that owned a factory making bottled water on the island.

In other words, the partnership between Parley and certain resorts appeared to be fuelling the creation of more plastic.

3 90 of trainers end up in landfill and take up to 1,000 years to degrade

A spokesman for Adidas said: “The use of recycled materials at Adidas is far more than our products made with Parley.

“More than 90 per cent of the polyester used in our entire product range is recycled polyester.

“We don’t talk about this being ‘the solution’. In fact, we actively say it is only a first step. This is made clear across our website and through our marketing.

“We are building up the recycled materials percentage in our products as more solutions become available.”

But Adidas is not the only brand that uses recycled plastic in surprisingly small amounts.

Other big names including Puma and Asics were also shown to use about 20 per cent of their materials from recycled sources.

Other brands have managed a better balance, including French trainers Veja, which use materials that are between 30 and 100 per cent made from recycled polyester and recycled plastic bottles.

Any cotton or other fabrics it uses are often organic or recycled, and it has developed a “vegan” material to replace elements of trainers that would normally be made from leather or plastic.

On the downside, they are more expensive, ranging from £95 to £120.

Meanwhile, Nike has taken a different approach to recycling. It introduced an initiative called Grind, where people can bring in their trainers to be ground up and re-formed into materials for playground surfaces and sports courts.

‘Just throw it in the bin’

It is already a questionable venture. The documentary reveals that most of the Grind material actually comes from industrial waste, not old trainers.

And the £130million of Grind material produced over the last 30 years represents just 0.01 per cent of the weight of new trainers produced annually.

Darcy also got a shock when he approached the manager at the NikeTown flagship store in London and was told they no longer recycle old trainers.

He said: “In fact, no store in the UK accepts recycling trainers.

“Nike Grind actually hasn’t been running in the UK for years now.

“They suggest I take my trainers to a charity shop because otherwise they’ll just throw them in the bin.”

As a result of the Dispatches programme, Nike has taken the Grind offer down from its UK website.

A spokesman for Nike said: “Our recycling and donation programme is currently available in 78 stores in Europe and we’re working to drive further scale.

“The programme is not currently available in the UK due to cross-border trade complexities that limit our ability to move product to our main recycling and sorting facility in the EU.""",How trainers using ‘recycled’ plastic from big brands like Adidas and Nike could actually be making the planet worse

Leading sportswear giant adidas unveiled their largest store in Bengaluru, located at the heart of the city- Brigade Road. The store is a blend of multiple digital touch points and embodies the future of retail experience for consumers.

Spread across 6500 sq. ft of retail area across four floors, the store focuses on 3 important pillars which are Experience, Sustainability, and Credibility.

The store provides the consumer a glimpse into the world of adidas, offering a wide variety of products and also has multiple sport & experience zones like an exclusive football floor with extended terrace play area, a gaming inspired lounge with an anx-box and an activity area for kids. The store is also enhanced using advanced technology which includes immersive screens, digital plinths to give customers a superior digital shopping experience.

In line with adidas’ long-term vision and commitment towards sustainability, the store houses a dedicated ‘Sustainability Wall’ which has been designed using electronic waste, displaying the End Plastic Waste logo. That is not all, the central Atrium installation at the store has been created in collaboration with local artists using only recycled bottles and plastic containers.

Commenting on the store launch, Sunil Gupta, Senior Director, Brand adidas said, “We are absolutely thrilled to open yet another phenomenal store in the heart of Bengaluru. The store not only provides our consumers a global shopping experience, but also gives them a glimpse into the world of possibilities with adidas, be it through our experience zones, our digital touchpoints, or our commitment to sustainability which comes to life with the sustainability wall and the installation made from plastic waste. We consistently want to elevate the in-store experience for our consumers through innovation, creativity, and design”

World Boxing Champion and adidas athlete Nikhat Zareen inaugurated the store. Speaking on the occasion Zareen said “I am super excited to inaugurate this beautiful adidas store today. This makes me reminisce about my first store visit, when I got my first pair of adidas shoes. A monumental moment for me as it was a pair which empowered me and to this day, I cherish it. That was my entry into the world of adidas,and from there on the possibilities for me have been endless. I wear my three stripes with so much pride and I am sure, this store too will be the first step towards many more such monumental journeys for young athletes in the years to come.”","Adidas’ largest store in Bengaluru a mix of ‘Experience, Sustainability, & Credibility’"

Having made its debut on the courts of the Australian Open in Melbourne in January 2022 with a splash, Adidas greeted Ian Thorpe, Jess Fox, Nathan Cleary and Steph Claire Smith aboard their ocean tennis court. Swapping their sport of choice for a chance at tennis, the athletics partook in a statement-making round on top of a marine barge along the Great Barrier Reef. The central idea of the event was to bring awareness to the effects of plastic pollution and the importance of cleaning up our oceans.

Adidas has worked side-by-side with GBRMPA (Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority) to achieve this satirical, yet powerful location. It is one of the GBRMPA’s authorised tug and barge operators that was transformed into a floating tennis court. A week out from the Australian Open, the barge, that regularly travels through the Great Barrier Reef for important environmental marine construction and diving projects, was transformed into a floating tennis court.

After the event the tennis court surface is slated to be fully recycled into a sports court, donated to a local Townsville school. Through these two acts, the company is paving the way for school kids to unite through sport and play a part in creating a more sustainable world. Adidas ambassador and swimmer, Ian Thorpe, in a statement expressed his pride in being a partner with the Adidas family saying, ""The design of the new Adidas tennis range made with Parley Ocean Plastic is inspired by the Great Barrier Reef, so it was appropriately launched in the stunning heritage-protected Queensland marine park today to raise awareness and positive discussion around how we can help end plastic waste. It was a day that none of us will ever forget. Plastic is a problem that has reached unfathomable proportions: unless we change course, there will be more plastic waste in the sea than fish by 2050. This waste is destroying the oceans.”

Athletes who were already in Australia were invited to take part Image: Courtesy of Adidas

Considering the uncertainty of global travel, Adidas invited athletes who were already in Australia to take part in this activity. All athletes arrived from either Sydney or Melbourne. Group travel was encouraged, so car and ferry transfers were clustered together where possible to further reduce the impact that travel has on the environment. This is in line with the inspiration of the brand's new tennis apparel collection. Worn by players during the Australian Open in Melbourne, the collection is inspired by the beauty of the Great Barrier Reef and consists of products from sustainability innovators, made with Parley Ocean Plastic. The hope is that the floating event would raise awareness and generate a positive discussion on the importance of ending plastic waste and ocean conservation.

Talking about the new range, Adidas Pacific Senior Director of Brand, Shannon Morgan, said, “At Adidas, we believe through sport we have the power to change lives. We live this purpose every day by looking at all possibilities to include and unite people in sport to help create a more sustainable world. We need to continue to implement sustainable solutions now so that we can help create a new era of sport for future generations. We are committed to help end plastic waste and, by 2024, we will replace virgin polyester in our products with recycled polyester wherever possible. To achieve these goals, we foster open-source partnerships and put a high value on collaboration over the competition to create sustainable solutions that go beyond our own business and influence.”

In recent years Australia has experienced a multitude of climate change related natural disasters such as bushfires, endangered ozone layer, and the ongoing pollution of single-use plastic that has contributed to the erosion of the Great Barrier Reef.

Dubbed “Solar Yellow,” the fresh makeover comes in eponymous neon yellow and black overlays.

The upcoming Adidas NMD V3 “Solar Yellow” rendition is slated to hit the sneaker world on Wednesday, September 14, 2022, at 7.00 am GMT. These brilliantly executed sneakers will be sold via the online stores of the shoe company and a few other retail shops. Each pair will cost you $160.

On December 9, 2015, a special premiere party was organized in New York City to officially introduce the NMD. The new Adidas design, spearheaded by Adi's VP of Global Design, Nic Galway, was able to combine elements from iconic Three Stripes models like the Boston Super, Rising Star, and Micropacer with the German athletic wear titan's flagship Primeknit and BOOST innovations.

Unlike some of the most well-received sneakers of the decade, the resulting design was the ideal synthesis of the classic and the modern.

You can stand out while also promoting sustainability with the brand new Adidas NMD R1 V3 ""Solar Yellow."" The outer midsole covering has been stretched for the new iteration, but some design elements from the previous iteration of this style have been retained.

A description of the upcoming Adidas NMD V3 Solar Yellow shoes on the brand’s website reads:

“Go ahead and check all the boxes with these adidas NMD_V3 Shoes. Breathable. Comfortable. Made with recycled materials. That's a yes to all three. Plus there's the style, like the perforated details, which is also where that breathability comes in. Playing with transparency, the 3-Stripes layer over the perforations, giving a glimpse at them underneath the monochrome signoff.”

The perforated mesh in the adidas NMD R1 V3 improves air flow. NMD R1 V3's upper is composed of a durable yarn made of repurposed polyester and Parley Ocean Plastic. The knit covering is held in place by ""Solar Yellow"" lining and ""Core Black"" reinforcements along the quarter's edges.

The upper is supported by a BOOST midsole with a gradient translucent overlay. The tongue flaps and lace fasteners are finished in ""Core Black."" The striking black laces are offset by speckled white hues. Furthermore, the insoles are stamped with Adidas branding. The translucent midsole casing also has shoe label branding prints on it.

Finally, the label's logo appears on the black outer sole units.

Adidas also emphasised the use of a sustainable design process in the creation of these sneakers, stating:

“This shoe's upper is made with a high-performance yarn which contains at least 50% Parley Ocean Plastic — reimagined plastic waste, intercepted on remote islands, beaches, coastal communities and shorelines, preventing it from polluting our ocean. The other 50% of the yarn is recycled polyester.”

Don't forget to pick up these Adidas NMD V3 ""Solar Yellow"" footwear pieces, which will be available on September 14 for $160 per pair through Adidas' shopping website and other partnering retail sellers.

Adidas and creative agency Mojo Supermarket created a recycling vending machine that accepts old plastic bottles as payment and offers discounts for new sustainable Stan Smiths, which are in turn partially made out of recycled bottles.

The vending machines, which can only be found at the Adidas flagship stores in New York and Paris, take empty plastic recyclable bottles as partial pay. Just insert the bottle, then the machine will confirm that the bottle is recyclable and then give you a voucher which you can take to the Adidas store checkout as payment.

The new Stan Smiths, which will be available in global markets later this year, feature the same silhouette and style as the original kicks, but they’re made with a premium PU-coated recycled polyester. The brand has stated that this new material will become the standard in Stan Smiths going forward.

More serious efforts integrate engineering patterns that leave little or zero waste in the manufacturing process. Sportswear giant Adidas is attempting to integrate not just one or two of these sustainable practices into the lifecycle of their sportswear, but a holistic effort integrating them all, manifesting in the Adidas FUTURECRAFT.LOOP Anorak.

For a span of six weeks this winter, I had the companionship of an early prototype of the brand’s FUTURECRAFT.LOOP Anorak to wear whenever weather would permit in modestly chill Los Angeles. Made of 100% recycled ocean plastic yarn provided by Parley and the non-dyed anorak proved to be a super lightweight piece of outerwear, one designed to insulate warmly and offer weatherproof protection with Primaloft insulation also, made from recycled plastic waste.

Noting this was a prototype accompanied with an invitation for feedback, I notably recommended including some form of hardware to secure the various straps that otherwise flapped loose; Adidas is reputedly planning to add snaps and recycled zippers to address feedback provided from their test group.

The FUTURECRAFT.LOOP Anorak’s dye-free components and recycled polyester yarn means it can easily be disassembled to be reprocessed at the end of its lifecycle to renew the loop. The dye-free jacket shows the natural color of recycled polyester. And to avoid waste, the anorak is made using a laser cutter for precision, resulting in the reduction of individual materials to mitigate the steps required in recycling. Additionally Adidas is exploring assigning QR codes to direct customers toward instructions detailing sending back the anorak and other future similar, providing consumers with transport labels, and likely satisfying collaborating prospects with presents playing cards or exceptional content.

Like Adidas’s efforts in designing recyclable sneakers, the FUTURECRAFT.LOOP Anorak is an attempt to make one person’s trash into everyone’s treasure.

According to a report last year from enterprise technology firm CGS, more than half of consumers in the United States and the United Kingdom — around 51% of respondents — ranked sustainability as an important issue to them. About 56% of U.S. consumers said they would pay more for a sustainable option, and that sustainable-minded companies are more likely to resonate with today’s shoppers.

Some boldface brands and retailers are listening: Over the past several months, a number of leading athletic, fashion and footwear companies have announced new and ambitious sustainability commitments. From Adidas to Walmart, FN rounds up the businesses leading today’s eco-centered discussions.

Adidas

Announced: December 2020

Goals: Adidas announced plans to make more than 60% of its products with sustainable materials this year. It also said that it would produce 17 million pairs of shoes with recycled plastic waste from beaches and coastal regions as part of its partnership with environmental organization Parley for the Oceans. From 2024 onward, the company would shift to using only recycled polyester in its products.

Wins: In 2020 alone, Adidas shared that it made more than 15 million pairs of shoes with waste product and collected alongside Parley almost 7,000 tons of plastic waste. It has also exclusively been using sustainable cotton since 2018.

Dick’s Sporting Goods

Announced: September 2020

Goals: Dick’s Sporting Goods intends to remove all single-use plastic bags from its stores by 2025. It also revealed that it has joined forces with Closed Loop Partners’ Center for the Circular Economy to seek more sustainable solutions to replace the current retail bag through the Beyond the Bag initiative. It will serve as the consortium’s sports and outdoors sector lead partner.

Wins: The retailer shared that it currently has a recycling rate of 70% across its retail stores and operations centers.

Nike

Announced: September 2020

Goals: Nike unveiled more details behind its “Move to Zero” program, which is intended to minimize its environmental footprint. It aims to power owned and operated facilities with 100% renewable energy by 2025, as well as reduce carbon emissions across its global supply chain by 30% in the next decade, which is in line with the 2015 Paris Agreement.

Wins: The brand recently piloted a new “visual badging” system highlighting more than 2,000 items both online and in stores that are made with at least 50% recycled content by weight. Shoppers are also able to filter their choices based on specific materials, such as organic cotton or recycled foam, and discover the brand’s process of turning trash into footwear and apparel.

Nordstrom

Announced: April 2020

Goals: Two days ahead of Earth Day, Nordstrom announced that it seeks to reduce its use of single-use plastics by 50%, starting with the phase-out of plastic bags from its more than 245 Nordstrom Rack stores. It also wants to ensure that 15% of all merchandise it sells is considered sustainable. What’s more, the department store chain said it would donate $1 million to support textile recycling innovation, as well as grant $100,000 to charitable organization The Nature Conservancy. The company has also committed to using sustainably sourced raw materials in 50% of polyester and cotton products from its Nordstrom Made brands, including Halogen, Chelsea 28 and Leith.

Wins: In August 2019, Nordstrom revealed its participation in the G7 Fashion Pact — a coalition of global brands and retailers including Chanel, Jimmy Choo parent Capri Holdings, Gap, Kering, Nike and Stuart Weitzman parent Tapestry. It also launched the shopping category Sustainable Style to narrow down eco-friendly products on its site for consumers.

VF

Announced: February 2021

Goals: Vans and The North Face parent VF Corp. announced its goal to eliminate all single-use plastic packaging — including polybags — by 2025. It added that all remaining non-plastic packaging used by VF and its labels will be reduced, originate from sustainable sources and be designed for reuse or recyclability. Across its enterprise, the corporation plans to remove all non-essential, single-use plastics “for which there is a viable product alternative” from all company-sponsored events by 2023. All VF-owned distribution centers are expected to be zero-waste by April 1.

Wins: VF is a longstanding participant of Canopy’s Pack4Good initiative — through which it has pledged that its paper packaging doesn’t contain materials from endangered forests or other controversial sources as well as reduces overall forest fiber consumption for packaging. At Timberland, which was honored with FN’s first Sustainability Leadership Award at the 2020 FNAAs, top executives outlined a vision for all of the label’s products to have a net positive impact by 2030.

Walmart

Announced: September 2020

Goals: Walmart has targeted zero emissions across its global operations by 2040. Working along with its philanthropic arm Walmart Foundation, it also intends to restore at least 50 million acres of land and a million square miles of ocean in a decade to help combat the effects of climate change. In order to achieve its goals without carbon offsets, the big-box chain said it would need to harvest enough wind, solar and other energy sources to power its facilities with 100% renewable energy by 2035. What’s more, it said it would cut out emissions from all of its vehicles, including long-haul delivery trucks, plus transition to low-impact refrigerants for cooling and electrified equipment for heating in its stores, clubs and distribution centers by 2040.

Wins: In 2019, Walmart shared that it powered around 29% of its operations with renewable energy and diverted 80% of its waste from landfills and incineration around the world. Its Project Gigaton program, which was introduced in 2017, also aims to avoid one billion metric tons of greenhouse gases from the global value chain by 2030.",These Boldface Brands and Retailers Are Making New and Ambitious Sustainability Commitments

Looking to bring back a sense of excitement once more, however, might be adidas’ new 4D Cush — which has just been previewed by the prolific sneaker leaker YankeeKicks.

adidas has kept the 4D sole unit (made from light, oxygen, and resin) relatively familiar throughout the course of its short lifetime, often delivering it in a green hue at around 5cm thick. It has appeared at just the rear of the heel on a 4D-BOOST hybrid, semi-concealed on Y3 pairs, and deceivingly thinner on the 4D Fusio, but now it has been given its most maximalist update so far.

For the adidas 4D Cush, cushioning is the aim of the game. At the rear, a large, pumped-up version of the 4D system appears in a “Carbon/Solar Green” mix, creating an elevated heel section before hitting what looks like adiPRENE. While we’re getting notes of the adidas Originals Ozweego’s adiPRENE midsole, wavy adidas branding on the medial-side midsole could mean this is some updated adidas tech.

As for the upper, you’ll find a mixture of mesh and TPU overlays that create a curvaceous, space-age aesthetic that combines with “Solar Green” waves on the mid-panel. YankeeKicks’ audience note nods to the Nike Air Max Tuned and Air Max 270 — but we’ll leave this up to you to decide.

Rounding out the shoe is a rather intriguing toe component that’s angular and protected with its bumper-like aesthetic, as well as Trefoil branding on the heel and more “Solar Green” hitting up the tongue. For now, we have no confirmation or further information on this pair, but we can expect to see more in the coming months ahead of the rumored 2022 release.

The 3-Stripes-branded area, like there tooling solution underneath, is made in part with recycled materials, following in the steps of the German sportswear brand’s other sustainable efforts. Together, each aforementioned component promises a ride that’s bound to help more runners break records.

What We’re Saying: Nigo and Human Made are never not collaborating. While currently prepping a release alongside KAWS, the Japanese label is also gearing up for yet another joint effort with adidas. Here, we find the frequent collaborators once again spotlighting the Tokio Solar, which is due to arrive in two new colorways in just a matter of days.

Created to coincide with the Tokyo Olympics, the Human Made x adidas Tokio Solar appears in blue and white and white and red iterations, each featuring breathable mesh underlays and suede overlays. Hits of leather add to the material composition, emerging via the Three Stripes branding on the side as well as the eyestays and at the heel. Below you will find adidas' Boost midsole tooling in white, making way for a Continental rubber outsole.

To signal the collaboration, Human Made's heart logo is debossed on one of the heels, while adidas' Trefoil insignia is applied to the other. The interior of the heel then features the year 2020, a nod to the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, which of course were pushed back to this year.

Look for the latest Human Made x adidas collab to arrive on July 24, just one day after the opening ceremony for the Olympics.

They’re called the RPT-02 SOL, and they cost $230. They’re available for order via the company’s website.

If you like music, working out, and love the planet, you’ll love Adidas‘ next pair of wireless headphones. The RPT-02 SOL is going to be light-powered, so you can listen nearly indefinitely without using energy from non-renewable sources.

Digital Trends had the scoop, with a conversation with Gustaf Rosell, chief product and innovation officer at Zound Industries, who worked together with Adidas to make the sustainable set of headphones.

That includes recycled materials from plastics used in the larger parts, recycled paper or responsibly sourced paper in the packaging, recycled polyester for the fabric sections, and the sweet tech in the headband that lets the headphones charge from any light source.

That tech comes from Swedish company Exeger, who also partnered with Urbanista for their upcoming Los Angeles headphones. Called Powerfoyle, it’s no normal solar cell. The advanced materials mean it can power up from even indoors or indirect light, so you don’t have to be sat in the sunshine to listen to your music.

The headphones have an 80-hour battery life, even without a light source, and a fun indicator on the headphones will show how well they’re recharging from your available light levels. They’re on-ear design so they’re great for the gym, and they’ve been designed to withstand the rigors of exercise.

The Adidas RPT-02 SOL will be available in the first half of 2022, with a projected price of $199 to $229.

While adidas hasn’t been burning up the sneaker market with general release product, they have been placing considerable emphasis on sustainability. Their new three paths strategy (reads more like four paths), similar to Nike’s Move to Zero, is a commendable start, which features a resale strategy as well, but it has its problems.

Source: THREE PATHS SHAPING ADIDAS’ FUTURE TO HELP END PLASTIC WASTE

Made with recycled materials we are speaking to our products that are made in part with recycled polyester or Parley Ocean Plastic – upcycled plastic waste intercepted on beaches and coastal communities, preventing it from polluting the oceans.

– upcycled plastic waste intercepted on beaches and coastal communities, preventing it from polluting the oceans. This is just the start. We’re also building new ways to keep products in play for longer through our Infinite Play program. It will include product takeback, resale, rental and subscription services. We’ll launch a takeback program in the US later this year and we’ll also be trialing a rental program for Terrex products this coming season in France.

‘Made to be remade’ is product that’s made to be worn, returned to us, ground up and remade into something new. After three generations of prototypes, we’ll be dropping the first Ultraboost DNA Made to Be Remade, made from 100% TPU, on Earth Day April 22.

Products that are ‘made with nature’ are sport and streetwear made in part with natural and renewable materials – offering additional innovative options that are created responsibly with inputs based on renewable resources. Today we’re sharing our first footwear created with the underground roots of mushrooms: Stan Smith Mylo.

A few weeks ago Nike announced Refurbished. I discussed it in the following post:

adidas had implemented their resale strategy in the UK and later in India. The company shot a great spot for the program that only garnered 63 views since last year. In essence, it was an announcement that went unnoticed and has probably been overlooked considerably since I haven’t seen anything on the program before and even in a search now, not much information is delivered. The lack of info is evident in the fact that a search for “adidas Infinite Play” doesn’t even show the adidas website on the first page. On the second page their GamePlan A site does show up with a very detailed post.

Brands as big as Nike and adidas simply can’t remove enough product from the marketplace to truly be sustainable. The amount of product generated without regard to eco-friendliness is too vast. Move to Zero for Nike and adidas’ new strategies are admirable, but when you dig into the discussing just a bit, there are problems.

On a UK review website, it shows that Infinite Play was discontinued last year. The obvious reason for this would be Covid-19. But, adidas didn’t give consumers any notice of shutdown. They even acknowledged this on their app in a picture that can be seen on the link above.

As the company prepares a rollout of Infinite Play in the U.S., my immediate thoughts on issues with the concept of Infinite Play is by my research adidas only has 30 stores in the U.S. Unlike Nike who had 339 stores in the U.S. in 2015. Nike has the ability to handle the return of products in a more efficient manner. They can repurpose their product because of the sheer number of outlets they have where they can place those used good. adidas would have to create a return facility in the U.S. Hire staff for the facility and then build a website, or add on to their current digital platform to process orders. If the issues in the UK are a measuring stick, and the fact that the UK is a much larger marketplace and is connected to the homebase of the brand, Infinite Play will be a difficult concept to initiate.

The Made to Be Remade and Made with Nature concepts are so limited in their reach, that like Nike and their Move to Zero products, the strategy is simply an attempt at leveraging good press. The Mylo based Mushroom Stan Smith above will undoubtedly be released in limited numbers and when it’s compared to the recent release from Saucony:

Both Saucony and adidas are making efforts that should be applauded, but they also have to be taken with a grain of salt. Sustainability is a buzzword. It allows a brand to trend positively in marketing, but ultimately a lot of work has to be done to truly make a difference. adidas is showing a consistent approach to problem solving and that is a good thing.",adidas’ Three Pronged Approach to Sustainability Includes a Revised “Infinite Play” Resale Strategy – ARCH-USA

Takahashi is known for her minimalistic touches in her art. She used elements such as circles and straight lines to represent infinite possibilities as USA Golf works to make history in this year’s competition.

The golfers will play Kasumigaseki Country Club near Tokyo, and each round’s uniform scripting will represent a different characteristic: Round 1 – wind, Round 2 – forest, Round 3 – fire, and Round 4 – mountain.

Golf in the Games begins with the four-round men’s competition July 30-August 1, and the women will compete August 4-7.

(Shop the Hiroko Takahashi Collection at Adidas for $40-$180.)

The men’s team will be fitted in Ultimate365 and Heat.Rdy polos so players can remain cool as Tokyo’s temperatures rise. The material is made of Aqua-X yarns that are built to wick away sweat.

Round 1 men: An Ultimate365 polo in a white base with bold blue stripes.

Round 2 men: A sport-inspired light gray printed polo with a blade collar.

Round 3 men: A bright red polo featuring Takahashi’s unique representation of fire.

Round 4 men: A blue polo that complements an athletic look with a single red stripe from the collar and into the sleeves for added design detail.

The men will have a blue pant option to wear as their bottoms. The pant is made with Adidas’ beltway material deigned for a soft and ventilated feel.

The women will wear a mixture of Heat.Rdy and Aeroready materials to beat the Tokyo heat and play comfortably.

Round 1 women: A crew mock short-sleeve polo with a white base and blue stripes, paired with a 16-inch Ultimate Solid Skort with a bright red under short for an additional color.

Round 2 women: A choice between a mock collar long-sleeve shirt, short-sleeve or sleeveless polo featuring a sport collar construction. The women will pair this with a 3-inch pull-on woven short in blue with a USA logo and side slits in red.

Round 3 women: The players will be decked out in all red.

Round 4 women: A dress with a mock collar and hidden-zip closure. The dress is sleeveless and has an athletic cut.

“I think that I was able to design with a different perspective from when I design products for everyone to wear,” Takahashi said. “I believe that golf is a unique sport in a sense that it’s an individual sport, but you can also play it with a team. With that in my mind, I designed the USA Golf uniforms with links of circles and lines, imagining the powers of individuals coming together as one and spreading into infinite possibilities.”

Like the pair that came before it, this blacked-out iteration is made from a mixture of utility-inspired materials — however, whereas the yellow offering presented itself covered in a black net webbing, this pair opts for something more tactile. For example, the toe box is made from heavy canvas, intersecting with leather on the toe box before more leather constructs the eyestay placket and mid-panel support.

Here, we find printed Three Stripes on a nylon mesh backing, synthetic overlays marking out the heel components, and a mesh tongue covered in the aforementioned web netting. Utility eyelets found on hiking boots grace the eyestay with “Solar Red” detailing adding to the underground aesthetic, while black rope laces thread across the tongue alongside the new addition of a metal and webbing tongue clip.

Of course, to round out the pair, adidas Originals adds a stacked sole unit that’s similar to that found on the Forum, only here it’s three times the size. adidas branding on the heel counter completes the look.

The brand has been following through its eco-friendly initiative by innovating manufacturing processes, upcycling, and recycling. We can only hope others follow in their footsteps soon. For now, let’s check out the Terrex Free Hiker Primeblue and what makes it sustainable.

The German activewear group is revamping its rugged outdoor-ready footwear catalog. Moreover, it seems the tweaks are for the greener good. Having recently featured their No-Dye Collection of golf shoes, the Terrex Free Hiker Primeblue is another notable step in the right direction.

Moreover, this is spreading awareness against pollution without compromising style. When hiking or trekking, it’s crucial that your gear is designed to perform to the highest standards. Given the unforgiving terrain and hazards, your feet need all the protection they can get.

Moreover, it needs to be adaptable and not restrict natural movements. To achieve this, Adidas gives it a water-repellent Primeknit upper crafted from its Primeblue textile. For those wondering, this material uses Parley Ocean Plastic which makes up 75% of the upper.

Each step you take answers back with incredible energy return from the Boost midsole. Combined with the sock-like fit of the Primeblue upper and exceptional traction from the Continental rubber outsole, these kicks are ready for the outdoors.

The Adidas, Terrex, and Primeblue branding are visible on the collar. Meanwhile, the iconic three stripes adorn the midfoot on both sides. The Terrex Free Hiker Primeblue comes with a rope lace closure and is available in five colorways.

A lot has changed about the UltraBOOST since its inception, from the weave pattern to the cushioning altogether. And for the relatively new UltraBOOST WEB DNA, the Three Stripes have transformed the shoe without straying too far from what made the original so special.

Most notably, the BOOST sole is encased in a rubberized cage, which is dressed a vibrant orange here. Above, the knit is threaded in a similar finish, whose 1.0-inspired weave pattern is highlighted in a dark black. Dark silvers, then, mark the stripes along the side, rounding out a simple but bold interpretation of the modified runner.

For a closer look at this newest UltraBOOST, check out the official images below. These are currently available right now on adidas.com at a retail of $180 USD.

From 28th May till 8th June, the adidas x Parley Run for the Oceans returns for a fourth year with the objective to address the devastating levels of marine plastic pollution in the oceans.

During the 2-week duration, for every kilometer run, adidas has pledged to clean up the equivalent weight of 10 plastic bottles, up to a maximum of 500,000 lbs of marine plastic waste from beaches, remote islands, and coastlines.

“As a global brand, and as global citizens, we have a big role to play in conserving the oceans and our planet. It is our responsibility to use our platforms, products, and voices to not just raise awareness, but to put into effect real action. In just three decades, the world’s oceans could contain more discarded plastic than fish if we don’t act now – only by working together and uniting can we end plastic waste,” said Alberto Uncini Manganelli, GM Running & Credibility Sports at adidas.

“More than a run or awareness campaign, Run for the Oceans has evolved into a powerful impact platform, one that inspires and empowers millions of people worldwide to unite around a common goal and support the oceans through sport, boosting the Parley movement through actual movement. And more than a partner, adidas has been a true ally, the family member we so urgently needed on our side to prove that industry can be the key that scales and accelerates solutions to the massive environmental problems we face. We believe that collaboration, creativity, and eco-innovation is the winning formula to save our oceans and end the global plastic crisis threatening the natural world, our own health and our future. Everyone who joins the run helps drive this vision forward,” said Cyrill Gutsch, CEO and Founder of Parley.

Unite and Run for the Oceans by signing up and tracking your runs via the adidas Running app. For more information and to sign up, visit adidas.com.my/runfortheoceans.

One of the brand’s latest projects still revolves around sports but comes in the form of audio equipment instead.

Some may not know this but Adidas has its own audio product lineup and we don’t mean those that the company have produced with Sennheiser before. Instead, what we meant is the Adidas Headphones family of products which are actually developed and designed by Zound Industries.

Based in Sweden, Zound was also responsible for bringing Marshall, who produced amplifiers used and adored by many musicians throughout the globe, into the world of consumer audio products in 2010. The partnership between Zound and Adidas is much recent though, as the initial batch of Adidas Headphones products was just launched in 2019.

Designed as the follow-up to the original Adidas RPT-01, what made the upcoming RPT-02 SOL rather interesting is the fact that it will be solar-powered, through the usage of Powerfoyle solar cell made by another Swedish company, Exeger. Aside from that, Zound will also be using recycled plastics in order to manufacture RPT-02 SOL.

As the story goes, this is not the first time that Exeger’s Powerfoyle is being used on a headphone. Previously, the company has also worked with audio peripheral company Urbanista to implement it on the Los Angeles headphones which will be released to the market later this month.

ADVERTISEMENT

However, the RPT-02 SOL will feature an on-ear design as opposed to the Los Angeles headphone which features an over-ear design instead. The fact that the Adidas-branded release is made for an active lifestyle, set them apart as well, given that the RPT-02 SOL will also be lighter than the Los Angeles headphone .

While the teaser video from Zound and Exeger has shown the general design outline of RPT-02 SOL, it is still going to be quite some time before consumers can get their hands on them though. At the moment, Zound plans to release the RPT-02 SOL within the first half of 2022 and are expected to have a price tag of between USD 199 (~RM 834) to USD 229 (~RM 960).

[UPDATE (12:56 AM / 15 July): This story has been updated to amend the information regarding Urbanista Los Angeles headphones.]

Away from all of the Yeezy release dates that’s recently been confirmed for 2021, adidas has been busy with dozens of mainline propositions. Case in point: An NMD R1 V2 in a tennis ball-reminiscent “Solar Yellow/Core Black/Core White” colorway.

Akin to BOOST-cushioned options that’ve surfaced since 2015, the forthcoming pair indulges in a predominantly-tonal arrangement. Profile 3-Stripes feature a “Core Black” outline that also complements trefoil logos stylized as thought bubbles on the tongue and heel. Sole units also boast slightly-accented makeups, although they’re free of playful graphics. Insoles, however, have a trefoil character thinking (about the Three Stripes, we assume).

The adidas UltraBOOST 21 hasn’t been officially announced by the Three Stripes, but it’s beginning to emerge in both official and unofficial images. The model’s inaugural colorway–a “Footwear White/Core Black/Solar Yellow” option–is currently scheduled to debut on February 4th.

At a glance, the silhouette is familiar to its 2015 iteration, but closer inspection reveals noteworthy updates. For starters, the BOOST cushioning it helped popularize among casual consumers has been redesigned to deliver six percent more foam than previous offerings. The increased cushioning enables improved comfort and a “bouncier” ride–whether training or traversing urban landscapes. As with other propositions under adidas‘ umbrella, the lightweight PRIMEKNIT+ top-half is constructed from PRIMEBLUE, a high-performance yarn containing at least 50% recycled Parley Ocean Plastic. Hits of “Solar Yellow” across the “Footwear White” upper nod to the Three Stripes’ performance-running heritage, having recently emerged on the adizero adios Pro “Sunrise Bliss.”

Underfoot, Continental rubber’s application has been reimagined around the Torsion bar-replacing adidas LEP (Linear Energy Push) technology. The wishbone-reminiscent structure delivers a 15% increase in forefoot-bending stiffness from previous solutions, which deliver extra propulsion. Together, the more robust BOOST midsole, stretch web tread and adidas LEP reenergize the UltraBOOST franchise.

Enjoy official images of the shoes here below, and expect pairs to hit adidas.com on February 4th with the $180 USD price tag of predecessors.

The adidas UltraBOOST 21 has yet to see an official launch, but it’s already emerged in a handful of colorways to cater to bold and model tastes alike. Its latest proposition, a “Solar Yellow/Cloud White/Screaming Pink” option, adds another tally to the former category.

A staple among the Three Stripes’ performance-running catalog, “Solar Yellow” takes over the pair’s entire PRIMEKNIT+ upper. Stabilizing structures on the heel deviate from the tonal scheme with their semi-translucent black makeup. Underfoot, the plump BOOST cushioning maintains its standard “Cloud White” aesthetic, but Continental rubber tread introduces “Screaming Pink” flair into the mix. Together, each tone creates a bold proposition perfect for 10K race training, trips to the corner store and everything in-between.

A month after adidas first unveiled colorways for their new Ultraboost 21, the model has finally arrived at the adidas webstore. Besides the arrangements that had surfaced throughout the month, a “Solar Yellow/Solar Yellow/Screaming Pink” offering is also available for purchase.

While an Ultraboost 21 that uses both Solar Yellow and Screaming Pink was revealed earlier, this new addition is an even louder take. The neon yellow-green hue goes beyond tinting the Primeknit+ uppers by coloring the stacked Boost foam midsole. The translucent lace cages take on a slightly darker shade, with this same color also applied to a pearlescent heel counter. As with the aforementioned pair, Screaming Pink is introduced by the outsole’s Continental rubber tread for an extra boost to the design’s color palette.

Grab a pair now at adidas.com for a retail price of $180.

The adidas UltraBOOST franchise has developed an extensive roster of models over the years, with the Ultraboost 21 being amongst the latest additions. However, the brand is sure to place focus on other BOOST-cushioned propositions as well, such as a new “Solar Red” offering for the UltraBoost 5.0.

The contrast between Core Black and Solar Red creates a graphic look delivered by the unique knit patterns of the uppers. To complement the woven design, the TPU lacestays and heel counter are in the aforementioned red. The red is further offset by black applied to the laces, inside, and the BOOST foam midsole. Although this isn’t the first time an UltraBOOST silhouette is getting a colored sole unit, it is still much more common for a pair to sport the classic white foam look. Continental Rubber underfoot provides added traction while rounding out the design.

Take a closer look at the UltraBOOST 5.0 below, which is scheduled to release on May 31st in Australia. Details for a release at North America’s adidas.com have yet to be announced, so stay tuned.

Albeit the launch date of the new adidas Ultraboost 21 is approaching, the brand has been able to diversify its focus among the handful of other propositions within the Ultra Boost franchise. For an upcoming release, the Three Stripes is referencing their earlier frameworks to deliver a fully neon 1.0 DNA trim.

The pair arrives in a “Solar Yellow” colorway that’s comparable to the IVY PARK Ultra Boost’s “Hi-Res Yellow” makeup, although slightly brighter. This shade covers the Primeknit uppers, lace cages, heel counter, and Boost midsole for an all-over fluorescent styling. Only a hint of white is applied to the rubber outsole and branding on the tongue.

The Ultra Boost 1.0 DNA will be available for purchase in Asia on January 27th. adidas fans in the States will be able to grab a pair at adidas.com for $180 when they drop in the near future.

As adidas prepares to roll out the Ultraboost 21, more colorways have been surfacing as part of the model’s debut. Joining the lineup is a black and grey pair that gets the slightest hits of Solar Yellow.

The Primeblue uppers are primarily Core Black, with grey accents wrapping around the forefoot and to toe areas. A translucent black lace cage sits atop the uppers, complemented by a matching heel counter. “ULTRABOOST” is printed in a neon Solar Yellow on the heel counter. The fluorescent shade is also used on the outsole to highlight the LEP cushioning system, which extends to the sides of the stacked Boost midsole.

Mark your calendars for the pair’s drop on January 28th at adidas.com. You can also grab a pair at select retailers during a wider release scheduled for February 4th.

From Tokyo retailer atmos to the NFL’s Jalen Ramsey and even gaming personality Ninja, the adidas ZX 2K Boost has been styled by a variety of brands and faces, making it a lifestyle silhouette bound to appeal to any audience. Perhaps more thoughtful collaborations will result from the release of the model’s sequel—the adidas ZX 2K Boost 2.0.

The new iteration will debut in two colorways: “Semi Solar Slime” and “Solar Red.” Inspired by the digital world, each pair sports a mesh upper that sees futuristic TPU accents. Hints of geometric, reflective elements are applied to the toe and heel further the theme of futurism. The TPU side stripes exhibit a satisfying gradient effect that distinguishes the new style from the initial ZX 2K Boost. Similar to the stripes, both the heel clip and the Wrapped Boost sole bring about pops of color to establish a two-toned look. A rubber outsole to match the full-length Boost midsole completes the sleek addition to the adidas ZX franchise.

Take a closer look at the ZX 2K Boost 2.0 below, which will drop at adidas.com on June 17th with a price tag of $150.

The adidas NMD line has recently enjoyed a boost from Pharrell Williams‘ Human Race imprint. For its latest proposition, however, the range has applied a “Hello Green/Core Black/Semi Solar Red” colorway to the lifestyle model.

Akin to previous iterations, the forthcoming pair indulges in a muted tone across its mixed-materials upper. Profile 3-Stripes boast a slightly different shade of “Hello Green,” and is partially hidden by a semi-translucent “Core Black” synthetic overlay just above the midsole. An eye-catching “Semi Solar Red” tone enters the mix at the heel pull tab and forefoot EVA plug. BOOST-cushioning underfoot and accompanying tread both don “Core Black” stylings that allow the aforementioned hues to revel that much more in the spotlight.

An official adidas.com release date may be in the works following a January 5th, 2021 launch in Asia. In the meantime, enjoy images of the NMD R1 here below.

adidas 4D technology was first introduced to the public in 2017, but it’s been in development for years before then. Recently, adidas Running has unveiled the new chapter of both its storied legacy and 3D-printed midsole innovation with the adidas 4DFWD.

Touted as “the future of running” by Alberto Uncini Manganelli, SVP and General Manager of adidas Running, the new silhouette combines 17 years of athlete data with advances in technology, design and sustainability. As its name suggests, the 4DFWD has been designed to move runners forward, a task approached differently on the UltraBOOST and adizero adios Pro. Insight gathered from the original FUTURECRAFT (2017) and its AlphaEdge (2018) and 4D Run (2020) successors helped inform the 4DFWD, in particular its lattice cushioning.

Over the past 18 months, adidas‘ design team mulled over one question: How to make every run feel like progress? In its attempt to answer this inquiry, the group created five versions of adidas 4D-cushioning, ultimately landing on a new, bowtie-reminiscent cell. Unlike previous iterations, the 4DFWD’s lattice system (unlocked by Carbon) features 23% more cushioning while delivering three-times as much forward motion; testing with athletes the likes of Wayde Van Niekerk, current world and Olympic record holder in the 400 meter race, discovered the peak breaking point (moment when running stress becomes overbearing) was reduced by an average of 15%. The FWD CELL’s shape shears forward, redirecting vertical impact into forward motion. On the sustainability front, the lattice structures comprise 39% bio-based material. Final specifications include: a PRIMEKNIT+ upper; redesigned rubber outsole; stack height of 11.3mm; and a weight of 11.75 oz. for a US size 9 (333gr. for a UK size 8.5).

The 4DFWD debuts in a “Core Black/Solar Red” colorway on May 15th via the adidas CONFIRMED app (sign-ups are open starting today, May 5th). A Tokyo Collection releases on July 1st, before hitting global retailers on August 12th. While you wait, enjoy official imagery of the launch pair ahead.

Elsewhere under the Three Stripes umbrella, a handful of new Yeezys have been confirmed for May and June arrivals.

They would be put through two days of detailed presentations on current and future programs as well as market and strategy. When the event was over, notebooks were full of material sufficient for several in-depth stories.

But when the aircraft manufacturer hosted its “Airbus Summit” Nov. 30-Dec. 1 in Toulouse and Munich, the contrast could not have been greater. The OEM presented a highly orchestrated multimedia show for more than 100 journalists and influencers, with many more participating online. Videos, sound and light effects, professional stage decoration and a detailed script were used to push a specific message.

OEM may delay ZEROe service entry if infrastructure lags behind

New concerns about hydrogen leakage emerge

That message, and the reason Airbus put in such an effort in the first place, was all too obvious: The pressure on the aerospace industry to do more to improve its environmental credentials is intense and likely will only increase. And Airbus is trying to position itself as the driver of the sector’s sustainability efforts, which it may be in some respects.

When the message runs up against reality, things get a little more complicated. Boeing is not in a position to launch any major development program that would result in a more efficient aircraft—likely for some years. Because of that, Airbus has no competitive incentive to move ahead on its own, and engine manufacturers have nowhere to put any new powerplants for the time being. And all of this is holding back any near-term leaps forward.

Most initiatives the sector is launching will likely have medium-term effects at best. Airbus’ signature project, the ZEROe hydrogen aircraft, is not likely to have a material effect on the sector’s carbon emissions for many decades. Whether the most promising roads ahead are instead sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) and hydrogen is largely dependent on progress in other industries—and political decisions.

Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury warned at the summit that things are not moving fast enough. “Ambition is not yet matched by action,” Faury said. “But the clock is ticking. It is difficult to overstate the scale of the energy challenge. The time for excuses is over, the time for action is now.” He indicated, for the first time, that uncertainty about hydrogen supply “could be a reason to delay the launch of the program, even if the technologies for the aircraft are ready.

“I am impressed by how this sector has come together, but overall it is a mixed picture,” Faury said. But he stated that “we need to have 10% of SAF by 2030.” The European Union mandate is for just 5%—and substantially less than 1% of global fuel consumption that is currently covered by SAF. Airbus aircraft are certified for 50% SAF use, with the OEM aiming at certification of 100% SAF by 2030. “We will be leading by example . . . [by investing] our own money,” Faury said.

Much of that money, along with ample French and German public research funds, is flowing into ZEROe. Airbus began by studying three different concepts: a regional aircraft, a narrowbody and a blended wing body. But Glenn Llewellyn, Airbus’ vice president for zero-emission aircraft, all but ruled out the blended wing body. Changing the propulsion system and the basic configuration of the aircraft in one single step would be “too much,” in his opinion. Instead, Airbus is aiming for a classic tube-and-wing concept “with a very different propulsion system,” he said at the summit.

Airbus is leaning toward handling hydrogen storage by putting two tanks behind the pressure bulkhead in the rear of the fuselage. Llewellyn warned that hydrogen aircraft are likely to be more expensive to operate than the cost levels airlines are used to today. “But not disruptively so,” he said. Airbus’ move to explore fuel-cell technology for ZEROe is also strategically relevant for engine manufacturers, and it can no longer be assumed that they are automatically onboard for the project. “But we could easily decide to partner on the engine,” Llewellyn said. Whether Airbus will go with fuel cells or direct hydrogen combustion is a decision for later. “We are not at that stage yet,” Llewellyn said.

Fred Krupp, president of the Environmental Defense Fund, is not even at the stage of wholeheartedly supporting hydrogen-powered aircraft. “Hydrogen can be a good thing, but not necessarily,” he said at the summit. In particular, he pointed to the emerging problem of hydrogen leakage, as well as the lack of standards for both hydrogen and SAF. “We have to make sure that SAF and hydrogen are steps forward, not backward.” He urged the industry to pay attention to the details, which may dictate the initiatives’ success or failure.

“Neither Airbus nor any other company has any equipment to measure [leakage],” Krupp said. But it should be investigated sooner rather than later. Hydrogen is not a greenhouse gas (GHG) itself but does have an indirect climate impact. The water vapor it helps create can form cirrus clouds, which increase global warming.

Moreover, to create water vapor, hydrogen combines with hydroxyl radicals that would otherwise react with methane—which is a GHG—and destroy it, Krupp said. The indirect greenhouse effect of 1 kg (2.2 lb.) of hydrogen is many times that of 1 kg of CO 2 .

Leakage could come from pipelines, and the farther the hydrogen is carried, the greater the chance of losses. Moreover, the small size of the hydrogen molecule makes it prone to leak.

The issue of leakage was underestimated for natural gas infrastructure until it was measured and understood, Krupp said. The problem should be carefully looked at, Airbus Chief Technical Officer Sabine Klauke said at the summit. Airbus is working on the issue with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and German aerospace research center DLR, she said, adding that “there are technical means to deal with it.”

As governments fund hydrogen projects, “we have to make sure those subsidies go along with leakage measurement,” Krupp said.

Airbus is working on adding catalysts at those places where hydrogen is about to leak, Klauke said. The catalyst causes a chemical reaction with oxygen, thus forming water. Universal Hydrogen, which is developing an ATR 72 hydrogen retrofit, uses such catalysts on its hydrogen modular tanks.

Meanwhile, Airbus is gearing up to start measuring the composition of the exhaust gases downstream in a hydrogen combustion engine. Under its Blue Condor project, the airframer is modifying two gliders with one small engine each. One is being designed to burn conventional Jet A1 fuel and the other one hydrogen, permitting a back-to-back comparison.

The focus is set to be on contrail formation, as contrails generate cirrus clouds. The question to be answered is how two opposing factors play out downstream in a hydrogen-burning engine: the absence of soot (which act as nuclei for the formation of droplets) and the greater generation of water vapor. Nitrogen oxides (NOx) are also to be measured. Instruments will be fitted to a light aircraft that will follow the gliders.

One modified glider has started flying but without the liquid hydrogen system, Sandra Bour Schaeffer, CEO of technology innovation arm Airbus UpNext, said at the summit. Flight testing is planned for the first quarter of 2023.

Airbus’ revelation that it will test a hydrogen fuel cell on an A380 testbed comes 18 months after the launch of the ZEROe project and the initial focus on burning hydrogen in gas turbine engines. An engine close to a turbofan was believed to offer a lighter-weight solution and therefore be more suitable for aviation. Airbus now wants to keep all options open, especially as a fuel cell may have less climate impact overall.

The 2.1-megawatt engine, resembling a conventional turboprop, is planned to be fitted on an upper-fuselage wing stub that is also being designed to test a GE Passport as part of a joint effort with CFM. The fuel cell engine test campaign is scheduled for the same period, 2026-28.

Both technologies use liquid hydrogen and are being explored in parallel, Llewellyn said. “At scale, and if the technology targets were achieved, fuel cell engines may be able to power a 100-passenger aircraft with a range of approximately 1,000 nm,” he added. “We are giving ourselves additional options that will inform our decisions on the architecture of our future ZEROe aircraft, the development of which we intend to launch in the 2027-28 time frame.”

A hydrogen fuel cell and the associated electric motor and propeller are expected to be more efficient than burning hydrogen in a gas turbine. Other benefits include the absence of NOx (which is suspected of contributing to global warming) and an even lower probability of forming contrails, which are known to play a role in global warming.

The test engine is being put together in Hamburg, Germany. It has been assessed at subsystem level, as the electric motor is still being tested.

Airbus has been cooperating with fuel-cell specialist ElringKlinger. In 2020, the two companies created a joint venture, Aerostack. The fuel cell in the test engine uses an arrangement that puts together cells into stacks, and the stacks into four so-called channels, making the layout scalable.

Before installation on the A380, full engine evaluations will take place at Airbus’ E-Aircraft System House ground-test center in Munich.

For the test engine, the Hamburg team kept subsystems segregated for better accessibility. Engineers came from the company’s space division—to take advantage of their skills in batteries—and Airbus Helicopters, for the gearbox that will link the motor and the propeller.

The biggest challenge will be weight. One should look at the full equation, factoring in the better efficiency, Hauke Luedders, head of fuel-cell propulsion systems for zero-emission aircraft, said at the summit.",Airbus CEO Warns Sustainability Progress Is Not Coming Fast Enough

The competition winners will receive access to Airbus’s Pléiades and Pléiades Neo satellite constellations and $5,000 in financing.

The satellites deliver images with resolutions down to 30 centimeters (12 inches) and could be used in applications such as anti-poaching, forest monitoring, and species population assessments.

The Airbus Foundation and the Connected Conservation Foundation (CCF) recently announced a new award for research that would use satellites to aid in biodiversity conservation.

The application period, open to individual researchers and nonprofit organizations, began Dec. 5 and ends Feb. 3, 2023. A team of four judges will assess the potential of proposals designed to address the global loss of species, which many scientists call Earth’s sixth mass extinction. Along with $5,000 in funding, the award comes with access to Airbus’s Pléiades and Pléiades Neo satellites. Pléiades Neo images come from a quartet of satellites offering spatial resolution down to 30 centimeters (12 inches).

“The open call sets out to look at the species in situations where high, 30-centimeter resolution imagery can really have a benefit,” Sophie Maxwell, executive director of CCF and one of the judges of the competition, told Mongabay.

CCF is an organization that aims to encourage the use of technology in conservation and nature protection applications, such as anti-poaching and population monitoring. In 2021, the group partnered with the Airbus Foundation, the philanthropic arm of the European aerospace company.

The goal, Maxwell said, is to find the bounds of the role that remote sensing can play in biodiversity conservation, including what it does and doesn’t do well.

“We have looked at use cases such as road detection [and] charcoal kiln detection, with variable levels of success,” Maxwell said. High-resolution imagery can help biologists better tabulate the sizes of wildlife populations. But there are limitations. Picking out the shapes of wildebeest against the varied background of an East African savanna, for instance, can be difficult, so projects aimed at monitoring on a more uniform background may work better, she added.

“One of the best examples perhaps would be counting penguins or other birds in the Arctic or Antarctic on their breeding grounds,” said Anna Schweiger, a postdoctoral researcher in remote sensing at Switzerland’s University of Zurich, who is not affiliated with CCF or the Airbus Foundation.

Schweiger noted that Pléiades Neo has a deep blue band for probing bodies of water. She said scientists have used WorldView, another set of satellites, to spot whales in clear water as deep as 30 meters (approximately 100 feet).

Schweiger said deep learning, a kind of machine learning and artificial intelligence, could be employed in tandem with Pléiades’ high-resolution imagery to gain new insights.

“The explosion of AI on satellite imagery is also making it much more … valuable and easier to get insights … because you’ve got analysis running on these huge images,” Maxwell said.

Schweiger said that scientists must be careful with the results of remote sensing, and noted that this type of imagery could have uses beyond conservation. (Airbus, for example, markets access to the Pléiades satellite constellation for military and intelligence uses.)

It’s also possible that imagery detailing, say, “the migratory routes of large swarms of fish,” could fall into the wrong hands, Schweiger said. “I can see that being a detriment to the survival of certain species.”

Still, Maxwell said addressing the biodiversity crisis requires innovative solutions, which she hopes the competition for this award will help to drive.

“This is a great chance to explore where this technology can help conservation efforts,” she added.

ALAMEDA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Wind River®, a global leader in delivering software for mission-critical intelligent systems, today announced it has worked with Airbus to support the A330 Multi-Role Tanker Transport (MRTT) aircraft for automatic air-to-air refueling (A3R). The MRTT aircraft is the world’s first tanker to be certified for automatic air-to-air refueling boom operations in daylight.

Airbus uses VxWorks 653 for the A330 MRTT air-to-air refueling boom system (ARBS). This system is comprised of multiple ARINC 653-compliant applications running at multiple levels of safety-criticality and achieved DO-178C DAL A certification.

With this development, the Airbus A330 MRTT A3R capability has earned the distinction of being certified by the Spanish National Institute for Aerospace Technology (INTA), involving multiple ED-12C / DO-178C DAL A applications running simultaneously on multiple cores on a multicore processor.

“A3R is a significant milestone in the evolution of airborne refueling systems. It is an honor to work with Airbus and play an important role in its latest A3R achievement,” said Avijit Sinha, chief product officer, Wind River. “The use of our industry-leading technology demonstrates continuing Wind River leadership in safety-critical real-time software solutions for mission critical systems. Wind River is able to help customers successfully navigate the challenges and complexities around certification.”

“Airbus is the first worldwide company to certify an airborne military equipment with an embedded multicore processor to the highest assurance level DAL-A covering CAST-32A requirements. With the support of Wind River, Airbus successfully navigated its multicore certification journey to achieve this impressive milestone. In addition to delivering its proven industry leading technologies, Wind River was a trusted advisor to help identify milestones, potential obstacles, and develop key metrics during the process to ensure that the system architecture was on the right track,” said Andrés Morán Valero, multicore certification team leader, Air Refueling Software group, Airbus.

The automated A3R system enables more efficient operation, reduces air refueling operator (ARO) workload, reduces inherent risk of this operation and optimizes the rate of air-to-air refueling transfer. In A3R, advanced technologies can identify the receiving aircraft’s shape and its refueling receptacle, then perform automated contact and fuel transfer while flying at high altitude.

Proven in the most challenging safety-critical applications, VxWorks 653 makes it easier and more cost-effective for technology suppliers to meet the stringent safety certification requirements of EN 50128, IEC 61508, ISO 26262, and ED-12C / DO-178C.

After 64 days of continuous flight, a solar-powered drone-satellite developed by Airbus Defense and Space crashed in the desert in the US state of Arizona on Aug. 18. The incident did not cause any injuries.

“The prototype aircraft's flight ended when the Zephyr 8 UAS encountered events that led to its unexpected shutdown,” said the US Army Command in a statement.

The drone was launched from the Yuma Proving Ground (YPG) test site in Arizona on June 15. The unmanned aircraft soared more than 60,000 feet (about 18 km) over the southern United States, the Gulf of Mexico, and South America, before returning to its starting point. Prior to the crash, air traffic control data showed the drone flying at an unusually low altitude.

“The military and its partners have collected invaluable data and increased knowledge about the endurance, battery efficiency, and station-keeping capabilities of the aircraft at high altitudes,” said said Michael Monteleone, director of the military program overseeing the flight. “This knowledge will allow us to continue to advance the requirements for reliable and modernized stratospheric capabilities for our soldiers.”

The drone, which is remotely controlled by satellite, weighs 75 kg. It has a wingspan of 25 meters and is entirely covered with PV modules with multi-junction cells. The system enabled the aircraft to travel more than 55,000 km, or more than one trip around the Earth.

The Zephyr 8 drone managed to double the previous endurance record for an unmanned aircraft, which was just under 26 days. Within a few hours, it would have been able to break the record for the longest flight in history, held by two American airmen, at 64 days, 22 hours, 19 minutes and five seconds in the sky.

Airbus Ventures led the round and was joined by AEI HorizonX–a joint venture between Boeing and leading private equity firm AE Industrial Partners–as well as GPVC, Stellar Ventures, Industrious Ventures and others.

A Solestial announcement says the new funding will be used to ramp up production and customer engagement as the company expands ground and flight testing. It will also fund research and development and sales and marketing activities.

Solestial’s core technology, which it has been working on for a decade as an Arizona State University spinout, is an “ultra-thin” silicon solar cell that can self-cure radiation damage at normal operating temperatures in space, the company says. It is packaged in a “flexible, lightweight panel designed to achieve minimum degradation for up to 10 years in LEO.” What is more, the panels can be mass-produced using automation, resulting in 90% lower costs than incumbent technologies and “virtually unlimited” manufacturing capacity.

“From the start of our diligence process, we were instantly impressed by Solestial’s solar cell technology, and we’re proud to be leading this impressive syndicate on a mission to help deliver advanced, lightweight, cost-effective solutions that power the new space economy,” says Mat Costes, partner at Airbus Ventures.

Most waste produced on international flights is commonly subjected to strict health controls, and the bulk is still either sent to landfill or to be incinerated. Certain items, however, can be recycled – although, until recently, airlines have had limited recycling success.

Emirates says it is determined to improve its onboard waste management processes, and at its core is the airline’s hard-working cabin crew, who have to quickly separate glass and plastic bottles as they collect meal trays and waste during a flight.

Recyclable materials are separated into dedicated storage units and then sent to a recycling plant in Dubai. Health controls still prevent recyclable material from being sent to any other facility apart from an airline’s home hub – an issue that affects every airline.

Glass bottles are separated by colour and crushed into reusable ‘cullets’ which can then be remelted and turned into brand-new bottles.

Meanwhile, plastic bottles are chopped into plastic flakes and sent to manufacturers to make brand new plastic bottles – including, in some cases, Emirates’ economy-class inflight blankets. Each one is made out of 28 recycled bottles.

Surprisingly, despite the sheer amount of plastic and glass recycled onboard last year, Emirates only started to separate recyclable material in 2019 after a member of cabin crew suggested the initiative during a regular feedback session. The idea was implemented within weeks.

Airbus Defense and Space has announced it will team with researchers from the University of New South Wales on a strategic research program to fast-track the development of high-efficiency solar cells to be used in space.

Airbus Defense and Space, a division of Airbus, has selected the University of New South Wales (UNSW) in Sydney to conduct a multi-year research project that is expected to push the performance of PV cells for space to the limit, both in terms of efficiency and radiation stability.

Airbus said the 3.5-year project will focus on the solar cells that are presently used to power spacecraft. Those cells are composed of several different layers of semiconductor materials that selectively absorb different parts of the solar spectrum. This selectivity enables the cells to operate more efficiently than the standard silicon solar cells used on domestic rooftops.

Professor Ned Ekins-Daukes, a researcher from the UNSW Sydney School of Photovoltaic and Renewable Energy Engineering, said the project will explore the merit of introducing patterned, non-planar layers into the cell structure, a technique known as interstitial light-trapping, which can further confine particular wavelengths of light into particular layers of the solar cell.

“Our research on high-efficiency solar cells can help extend the operational life of a spacecraft and lead to light-weight, lower-cost solar arrays,” he said.

Ekins-Daukes, who has previously developed nanostructured, strain-balanced PV absorbers that have utility for solar power conversion in the space environment, said the partnership with Airbus has the potential to open opportunities for commercialization of this technology in Australia and internationally.

With its Zephyr range of planes, airplane major Airbus is also using the renewable and most abundant form of energy to power long-duration flights.

Airbus Zephyr

The Zephyr isn't a commercial airplane meant to transport people over long distances. Instead, it is a High Altitude Platform Station (HAPS) that can fly in the stratosphere at around 70,000 feet (21 km), almost twice that of regular jet-engine powered aircraft.

The aircraft has 82 feet (25 m) wingspan but weighs under 165 pounds (75 kg). According to its website, the Zephyr is payload agnostic and can be used to capture imagery or radar or automatic identification systems for military, institutional or commercial uses. At its highest altitude, a single Zephyr can provide the coverage equivalent of 250 cell towers and could be used to improve connectivity in the remotest parts of the world.

Since the aircraft is powered by solar energy alone, it can stay airborne for long durations of time. Previously, the Airbus team has flown the Zephyr continuously for over two weeks on multiple occasions. This time around, the Zephyr was airborne for 64 days when it crashed.

How did Airbus Zephyr crash?

According to Simple Flying, Airbus has been testing iterations of its Zephyr planes in Arizona for many years. The latest iteration of the aircraft, called Zephyr 8, was now close to breaking the record for the longest recorded flight, which is held by a Cessna 172 Skyhawk flight that took place 63 years ago.

The company is working to mimic the behavior of bird flight with wings that adapt their shape on the fly to optimize aerodynamics, making for more efficient aircraft with lower carbon footprints.

The eXtra Performance Wing project was borne out of a similar Airbus project called AlbatrossOne, which in 2019 saw engineers fly a scale-model airplane with flapping wing tips. Inspired by the albatross wing, the wings featured semi-aeroelastic hinges that responded to turbulence and gusts of wind to lessen the load on the airframe, reducing the need for reinforcing structures and saving considerable weight as a result.

Launched last September, the eXtra Performance Wing demonstrator is a continuation of this thinking, consisting of a scaled-down Cessna jet that can be fitted with gust sensors, pop-up spoilers and multifunctional trailing edges. The platform will be used to rapidly test and develop these types of technologies, with a view to improving aerodynamics for future aircraft.

“The scaled demonstrator will integrate and fly breakthrough wing technologies using a remote-controlled Cessna Citation VII business jet platform in representative flight conditions,” explained Oliver Family, Head of eXtra Performance Wing UK. “The partly 3D-printed wind-tunnel model – expertly built by the aerodynamics team at Airbus’ low-speed, wind-tunnel facility in Bristol – is a scaled-down version of the Cessna jet, incorporating the lightweight, long-span design of the eXtra Performance Wing that will provide the emissions benefits we are striving for.”

Aerospace engineers regularly turn to bird flight in an effort to improve aircraft performance. We've seen research projects show how shape-shifting wings can make aircraft more efficient, and others that demonstrate how owls could inspire planes that fly more quietly and handle strong winds. Airbus hopes that by exploring the possibilities of biomimicry at its Filton wind tunnel near Bristol, it can soon get some of these technologies off the ground.

“Airbus’ state-of-the-art low-speed wind-tunnel is a fantastic way to validate our concepts before flight tests,” added Oliver Family. “Our computational aerodynamic analysis capability is world class, and the wind tunnel provides another valuable way to measure the performance and capabilities of the aircraft before flight testing. The technologies we have tested in the Filton wind tunnel – many inspired by biomimicry – will now be rapidly integrated for flight testing.”

I have appreciated Grigsby’s work on the fentanyl crisis among our youth. I also read the brief regarding Collin County Sheriff Jim Skinner, working with the North Texas Sheriff’s Criminal Interdiction, seizing 6,000 fentanyl pills. I remember a prior large seizure also.

But he and his colleagues must feel as if they are playing whack-a-mole by themselves! While Grigsby focused on the failure of the schools to protect students, schools can only do so much besides education and alerts because dealers usually operate off school grounds.

We need a united effort! Could we have an interview with Skinner on how we all could support the efforts of local law enforcement? Would an anonymous tip line help? Do we need to use the state surplus to attack this crisis?

Whatever the solutions, we need to listen to the people on the front lines — local law enforcement, schools, Border Patrol, the Drug Enforcement Administration — and work together. We could ask our politicians to work with Mexico to stop the flow of raw fentanyl from China.

And we can’t allow politically motivated issues to distract us. This is not a campaign issue. It is our kids’ lives!

Don’t blame the schools

The recent fentanyl deaths among Carrollton-Farmers Branch students are tragic. But by what distorted logic are the schools at fault for not preventing off-campus drug use by kids who bought the drugs from adolescent criminals who acquired them from other criminals?

Schools’ responsibility is education. Parents are responsible for teaching their children to eschew the drug culture, paying attention to what their kids are doing and taking appropriate measures if their children still experiment with drugs. Parents must not blame the schools for not doing what the parents themselves have failed to do.

Keep protests civil

Re: “Nearly 1 million march in 4th day of pension protests — Flashes of unrest mark biggest demonstration in Paris since the start,” Sunday news story.

Retirees appreciate your coverage of the historic protests in France as its government tries to raise the pension age from 62 to 64. However, the article came with a photo of a burning car. Americans who intend to hit the streets if certain Republicans persist in trying to “sunset” or “reform” (cut) Social Security and Medicare should forego using arson as a tactic.

Entire state at risk

Re: “Texas Lakes, Rivers Are on the Line ― EPA is looking into complaints of TCEQ’s ‘broken system’ of water permits,” Sunday editorial.

It’s not just Texas’ water resources that are endangered. The entire state, its infrastructure, its economic stability and social capital, and the public health are at risk.

As of December 2022, 33 states have climate action plans. Texas is not one of them. It’s no wonder that regulatory agencies such as the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and the Texas Railroad Commission, which regulates the oil and gas industries, are egregiously ineffectual. There is no plan other than the status quo. The regulators are controlled by those whom they are supposed to regulate.

Climate plans set greenhouse gas emission targets and actions to accomplish them. They enact sustainability measures to ensure a livable future. They set standards to maintain safe infrastructure such as highways and bridges affected by higher temperatures and frequent flooding. They are long-range plans, not incremental, patchwork policies designed to delay progress.

Many Texas cities have adopted their own climate plans. But our state legislators and their leaders are doing little, if anything, to prepare for the challenging future that we know is coming. We need to put them on the line.

Protect public from bad vets

Re: “Our Pets Deserve Better Than This — Poodle’s death shows why Texas vet board needs overhaul, but adding it to another board is a bad idea,” Feb. 7 editorial.

As a Texan whose beloved dog suffered catastrophic harm at the hands of a violative veterinarian, I heartily agree with the editorial board that we need an efficient, responsive Texas Board of Veterinary Medical Examiners.

During my seven-year history with the Texas Board of Veterinary Medical Examiners, veterinary professionals’ interests have repeatedly and increasingly been prioritized over the public’s. To be clear, the Texas Board of Veterinary Medical Examiners is a state agency meant to protect the public from violative veterinary professionals. Whereas the Texas Veterinary Medical Association is a special-interest group that protects veterinary professionals.

The veterinarian in my case continues to practice without consequence despite numerous complaints of incontrovertible wrongdoing. My experience is unfortunately not isolated.

While I do believe the Texas Board of Veterinary Medical Examiners requires additional funding to effectively carry out its stated mission, I fear if extra appropriations are awarded without strict supervision, the agency could become even more aligned with the Texas Veterinary Medical Association, and public protections may vanish altogether.

It is hoped the research will help push the performance of photovoltaic solar cells for space to the limit, both in terms of efficiency and radiation stability in the space environment.

The research project will be led by Professor Ned Ekins-Daukes, at the UNSW Sydney School of Photovoltaic & Renewable Energy Engineering. Prof Ekins-Daukes has previously developed nanostructured, strain-balanced photovoltaic absorbers that have utility for solar power conversion in the space environment.

“We are pleased to partner with UNSW Sydney for such an exciting development,"" Richard Franklin, Managing Director, Airbus Defence and Space UK, said. ""This is another example of the world class research capabilities to be found in Australia, and in partnering with UNSW Sydney, we aim to bring these leading-edge research results to applications in space.

""Airbus aims to develop new capabilities for the space industry and is committed to build the local space eco-system in Australia.”

“Our research on high efficiency solar cells can help extend the operational life of a spacecraft and lead to light-weight, lower-cost solar arrays,” Professor Ned Ekins-Daukes said. “We are excited to work with a global leader in the space industry, opening opportunities for commercialisation of this technology in Australia and internationally.

""Partnering with Airbus’ experts will help us to understand the broader aerospace industry requirements for solar power and realise the full potential for these future solar power technologies.”

This research project involves a focus on the solar cells that are presently used to power spacecraft composed of several different layers of semiconductor materials that selectively absorb different parts of the solar spectrum. This selectivity enables the solar cells to operate more efficiently than the standard silicon solar cells used on domestic rooftops. The project will explore the merit of introducing patterned, non-planar layers into the solar cell structure, a technique known as interstitial light-trapping, which can further confine particular wavelengths of light into particular layers of the solar cell.

The project will be supported Dr Phoebe Pearce, a Research Fellow with the ARC Centre of Excellence for Exciton Science at UNSW and Dr Michael Nielsen, UNSW Scientia Research Fellow.

“The partnership with Airbus will capitalise on UNSW’s research strengths and capabilities in the development of high efficiency solar cells for use in space,"" Vice Admiral Professor Paul Maddison, Director of the UNSW Defence Research Institute said.

The Zero Emission Development Centre, complementing its UK research platforms as well as work in Spain, France and Germany, will be set up at the aerospace firm’s Filton facility and focus on cost-competitive cryogenic fuel systems.

Technology development for the new centre has already commenced, and Airbus says it will cover a range of capabilities from components to full systems and cryogenic testing.

It adds that Airbus’s UK operation specialises in end-to-end fuel system development and such equipment will be “crucial” to hydrogen aircraft performance.

Airbus’s zero-emission facilities will be ready for Initial fully-functional cryogenic hydrogen tank ground-testing next year, and flight-testing in 2026.

Speaking during an event in London on 25 May, Airbus chief executive Guillaume Faury remarked that he had viewed the high-speed Lockheed SR-71 reconnaissance aircraft at Washington’s National Air and Space Museum.

“We think the hydrogen aircraft, the first fully decarbonised [aircraft] is a fantastic innovation,” he says. “When you look at what they did on the SR-71, that’s very inspiring. They did so much in a short period of time that it gave me a lot of energy – that we’re going to make it on the hydrogen [aircraft].”

Faury stuck to his belief that a zero-emissions aircraft could be ready by 2035.

Airbus says it will benefit from a UK government commitment to guarantee £685 million ($860 million) in function to the Aerospace Technology Institute over the next three years, intended to support low-emission aircraft innovation.

“We can continue to invest in one of our largest [research and technology] programmes, the ‘Wing of Tomorrow’, based in Bristol and Broughton, and launch new [research] development around fuel and landing systems,” adds Faury.

According to Aaditya, Tata-Airbus officials told the then Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government that they would have to put up the aircraft production plant wherever the Union government asked them to.

The Shiv Sena MLA also denied Fadnavis' claim that the previous MVA government did little to maintain the Vedanta-Foxconn semiconductor plant in the state, which was subsequently relocated to Gujarat. He said multiple talks had occurred early this year between Vedanta officials and the previous government.

A new spat has erupted between the incumbent Eknath Shinde government and the Shiv Sena-led opposition to the Rs 22,000 crore project to relocate the manufacturing of C-295 military transport aircraft from Maharashtra to Vadodara in Gujarat.

Earlier, Fadnavis said that the decision to relocate the Airbus project was made while Uddhav Thackeray was chief minister.

""Despite being a state opposition leader, I invited the chiefs of the Tata-Airbus Defence projects to my home on April 24, 2021, and I spoke with them and promised them that I would talk to then-chief minister Uddhav Thackeray about keeping the project in Maharashtra.” “However, they said to me, the state's atmosphere is not worth investing in,” he said.

Fadnavis, who served as chief minister from 2014 to 2019, said that he had followed up with companies since 2016 and continued to do so until 2019.

The senior BJP official further said that the French (aviation) business Safran will open its (plane MRO) facility in Hyderabad in 2021, however, the Opposition blames the Shinde-BJP administration for the project's failure.

Meanwhile, Aaditya asked Fadnavis to divulge the identities of Tata-Airbus personnel who purportedly advised him, while he was opposition leader, that the investment climate in Maharashtra was unfavourable.

""When the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maharashtra government contacted with Tata-Airbus Defence executives, they stated that they would have to establish the facility wherever the Union government requested. I challenge Fadnavis to name the officials who warned him that the environment in Maharashtra was not conducive to investment,” Aditya said.

""It is his failure that he was unable to take real moves to bring the Tata-Airbus Defence factory to Nagpur in three years. If that aircraft manufacturing plant was completed in Gujarat, why did Union Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari write to that company pleading with them to locate their project in Nagpur?"" he asked.

However, Fadnavis claimed that at one of the early meetings with company officials (Tata-Airbus consortium), he promised extra amenities to ensure the project remained in Maharashtra, but the state government that took over (in late 2019) did nothing to keep the project.

Aaditya explained the timeline for multiple meetings with Vedanta Foxconn and MVA government officials. He claimed that Foxconn representatives had visited Talegaon, near Pune, where the plant was to be built.

""On June 24, Foxconn's chairman toured the Talegaon site with MVA government officials, where the projected Rs 1.49 lakh crore semi-conductor facility was to be built. Officials from Vedanta-Foxconn have already acknowledged that the Talegaon site is suited for such a massive project,” he said.

“If, as Fadnavis claimed, Vedanta-Foxconn had already chosen to build the plant in Gujarat, why would they waste time with us,” Aaditya asked Fadnavis.

Aditya further said that the Maharashtra government gave Vedanta-Foxconn a package comprising incentives worth Rs 10,000 crore higher than Gujarat's proposed. The semi-conductor project is one of the most unusual of its kind, and it appeared that it will be established in Maharashtra.","Tata-Airbus Project Row: Company Officials Said, 'Unfavourable' Investment Climate In Maha: Fadnavis"

At times, the conversation was remarkably frank, and the technological details (and in places strategic overview) were often insightful.

The first session covered air traffic management, with a striking strength of feeling across the industry, particularly from airlines, that more efficient ATM is juicy and low-hanging emissions fruit — 6-10% efficiency gains were cited by Airbus — and one that, it can be argued, has been inadequately addressed by governments.

Early on the first morning of the summit, Airbus, Air France and French air navigation service provider DSNA collaborated on an optimised-trajectory flight between Paris and Toulouse with an Airbus A320ceo. Part of the ALBATROSS programme under the auspices of the remarkably widescale EU SESAR Joint Undertaking, a series of gate-to-gate live demonstration flights across Europe will put many solutions into practice, including new precision approach procedures and continuous climb and descent.

The electric agenda for the summit was largely focussed on helicopters and the air taxi/urban air mobility segment. Airbus unveiled a new helicopter engine backup system that could pave the way to a hybrid helicopter future, and an updated CityAirbus urban mobility vehicle. For some observers, however, this vehicle remains unpersuasive, both from a practicality and emissions standpoint.

The new CityAirbus’ speed is less than that of an electric car on a French motorway (120km/h versus the 130 km/h limit), and its range just 80km, about a third of that of a Renault Zoe electric hatchback being driven at top autoroute speed, leaving it still in “solution searching for a problem” mode. With Airbus scrapping its hybrid E-Fan X project last year, it was a shame not to hear more of the prospects of electric airliners, even the smaller ones.

Day 1 of the summit rounded out with a very punchy CEO panel on net-zero consisting of easyJet’s Johan Lundgren and Frontier’s Barry Biffle, both of whom were bearish on the question of sustainable aviation fuels. This position from single-aisle, shorthaul LCCs that are likely to be more in the zero-emissions hydrogen and electric spectrum in the medium range, is perhaps not surprising. But the frankly dismissive attitudes on the part of both CEOs were part of a “no, but” narrative that really struck your journalist in much of the panel discussion going on at the summit.

Aviation, as European aviation’s Destination 2050 programme explains, will clearly need a variety of technologies to replace fossil fuel power. In short, it will need a “yes, and” narrative. Zero-emissions, yes, and sustainable aviation fuels. Perhaps SAF is not the primary solution for easyJet or Frontier. That doesn’t mean that it’s a bad solution overall, or even for other airlines: indeed, its drop-in substitutability means that it can make an immediate impact.

The second day started with a discussion of the role of space in detecting climate change, and then led into what was the highlight of the entire two-day event: a net-zero panel with Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury, Airlines for Europe CEO Thomas Reynaert, Heathrow Airport CEO John Holland-Kaye, International Energy Agency head of energy technology Timur Gül, and environmental group Transport & Environment’s aviation director Andrew Murphy.

The debate was frank and thought-provoking to an extent not often seen in aviation, and Airbus is to be commended for bringing civil society in as part of the discussion, even if there was a certain amount of glaring happening elsewhere on the panel. Your author strongly recommends taking the hour and a quarter to listen through.

The morning wrapped with an interesting if lighter session on staffing and the employment pipelines, and then after lunch came back with some in-detail sustainability discussion among executive-level sustainability managers at network airlines Cathay, Delta, LATAM and Lufthansa.

The final session of the summit featured some technical detail of the new zero-emissions aircraft, concept aircraft and technology demonstrators from Airbus’ new chief technology officer Sabine Klauke and several industry technologists. It’s a useful watch to understand more about the hydrogen ecosystem (including the partnership with Air Liquide and Vinci Airports for a hydrogen trial at Lyon) and several new technologies around wings, including the new X-wing extra-performance wing demonstrator and the Wing of Tomorrow technology programme.

Overall, the summit was an informative success, and the broadcast a welcome option for those (like your author, invited but unable to attend owing to a non-COVID-related throat infection) watching from home. Indeed, given that the summit was primarily audio with very little visual material, readers could usefully listen back during a commute or wherever they might otherwise listen to a podcast.

The one major disappointment was the notable and visible lack of diversity in the summit at multiple points. It is five years since Runway Girl Network called Airbus’ previous CEO to task for all-male and very white panels at a similar event. While visibility of senior women has improved in some ways at levels in Airbus, the summit featured several all-male panels, an unacceptable situation in the year 2021. Solving the climate crisis and making aviation sustainable will require the contributions of all in society — not just white, middle-aged men from Europe.

Airbus has signed a partnership agreement with CFM International, a 50/50 joint company between GE and Safran Aircraft Engines. The companies will work on a hydrogen demonstration programme, with an aim of delivering a test flight in the new few years.

Both ground and flight tests will be issued for a direct combustion engine fueled by hydrogen. The demonstration will use an A380 flying testbed equipped with liquid hydrogen tanks prepared at Airbus facilities in France and Germany.

It is hoped that the technology can be used to assist with zero-emission flights by 2035.

“This is the most significant step undertaken at Airbus to usher in a new era of hydrogen-powered flight since the unveiling of our ZEROe concepts back in September 2020,” Airbus’ chief technical officer Sabine Klauke said.

“By leveraging the expertise of American and European engine manufacturers to make progress on hydrogen combustion technology, this international partnership sends a clear message that our industry is committed to making zero-emission flight a reality.”

Airbus first unveiled futuristic concept designs for zero-emission aircraft with hydrogen as the primary power source, back in 2020. At the time, the organisation claimed that they could operate commercial flights by 2035.

Airbus said in a statement that it believes hydrogen “holds exceptional promise as a clean aviation fuel” and has been working to design the concepts for several months.

Airbus has called the range of aircraft ‘ZEROe’ – short for zero-emission. It has said that governments and airports will need to provide “significant” investment in green hydrogen generation infrastructure and hydrogen transport and refuelling systems if the designs are to become a commercial reality in the coming decades. On the former, less than 1% of the hydrogen produced in 2019 was made using 100% renewably-powered processes, according to Wood McKenzie.

Airbus is in alignment with the Air Transport Action Group’s climate ambitions to get the aviation industry to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

Major companies are under increasing pressure from investors and climate change activists to report the emissions that result when customers use their products, known as “Scope 3”.

Airbus says it is the first planemaker to do so.

It says it is driving aerospace toward zero-emission flying with plans for a commercial aircraft powered by hydrogen by 2035, which it reaffirmed on Friday.

But environmentalist groups say that flying itself needs to be curbed to have a meaningful impact on climate change.

Airbus estimated lifetime emissions for jets built in two dramatically different years: 2019, which saw record deliveries on the back of an order boom, and 2020, when the pandemic sent aviation into crisis and forced Airbus to slash output by 40%.

For the 863 jets it delivered in 2019, Airbus estimated lifetime emissions of 740 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent based on an average aircraft lifespan of 22 years. That includes 130 million tonnes related to the production of fuel burned in flight.

In 2020, it delivered 566 aircraft with estimated lifetime emissions of 440 million tonnes, including 80 million for fuel.

Airbus also published carbon intensity data suggesting an “average efficiency” of 66.6 grammes of CO2e per passenger-kilometre in 2019, improving to 63.5g in 2020.

A senior Airbus official said the data included conservative assumptions for synthetic fuels, whose use is expected to grow.

Intensity-based targets measure greenhouse emissions relative to industrial output, meaning absolute emissions can rise even if the headline intensity figure falls.

‘DRASTIC ACTION’

Aviation produces 2.5% of human-induced CO2 emissions and 12% of CO2 from transport, the industry says. It has pledged to reduce net carbon emissions to 50% of 2005 levels by 2050.

“The scale of the emissions disclosed underlines the need for governments to take drastic action to rein in the climate impact of flying,” said Andrew Murphy, aviation director for Brussels-based environmentalist group Transport & Environment.

Airbus did not provide data for non-CO2 emissions, which some scientists deem at least as much of a threat as CO2. But it said it was working on initiatives that have been promoted to help address this, including improved air traffic management.

Airbus also reported emissions from its factories, giving a glimpse of a multinational network linked by boats, trucks, barges and huge cargo planes.

Its own CO2 emissions decreased by about 20% last year amid the pandemic, and Airbus purchased 21% less water in Europe. It also produced 25% less waste and potentially damaging vapours.

Airbus aims to consume 20% less energy and emit 40% less CO2 from its more than 70 sites by 2030, compared with 2015.

With these additional aircraft, it expects to offer up to eleven million seats during 2022, 40% more than in 2019.

In 2021, the company replaced its Boeing 717s to complete a fleet composed entirely of Airbus A319 and A320 aircraft. While it had planned to make this unification in 2023, it brought forward its plans to improve operating costs in the short term and increase its network offering, with aircraft of greater capacity and flight range.

“As a European airline, we see Airbus as a long-term partner for our fleet”, said Carlos Munoz, company’s founder and CEO. “This year, following our strategy, we will continue to connect medium and small European cities, and we will launch our largest offering in the market, with more than eleven million seats for sale and the opening of two new bases in France”, he added.

Volotea currently operates flights to more than one hundred European destinations from its bases in Asturias, Bilbao, Athens, Hamburg, Bordeaux, Lyon, Marseille, Nantes, Strasbourg, Toulouse, Genoa, Naples, Olbia, Palermo, Cagliari, Venice and Verona.

The company focuses on point-to-point operations between cities that cannot be connected by car or train in less than six hours. More than half of its flights connect the mainland with islands such as Corsica, Sardinia and Sicily.

Voloterra program

The acquisition of the A320s is also part of “Voloterra”, the company’s sustainability program. Among its objectives are to develop alternative zero-emission technologies and work to improve air traffic efficiency. In addition, Volotea expects to start using sustainable fuels to power its aircrafts in 2022.

From 2021, Volotea offers the possibility of offsetting the carbon footprint when issuing a ticket. The additional sum of two euros is earmarked for emission mitigation projects, such as reforestation and forest conservation initiatives, transition to the use of renewable energy and energy generation from waste. It plans to offset 25% of its emissions by 2025.

“Since the company was founded, we have worked tirelessly to minimize carbon emissions, starting with a strategy of offering direct flights between cities not served by other airlines, without wasting fuel”, said Gloria Carreras, Director of Corporate Social Responsibility and Sustainability. “With this program we intend to go one step further, accelerating the transition to an increasingly cleaner and more sustainable aviation sector and a zero-emissions future”, she added.",Volotea adds six new Airbus A320s and reinforces its commitment to sustainability

Reported first by EandT, aeroplane maker Airbus is developing an aircraft that can fly using solar energy, and recently it has managed to continuously fly for nearly three weeks without landing. The aircraft has a wingspan of 25 metres and weighs just 75 kilograms.



Dubbed Zephyr, it has flown six times until now -- four low-level test flights and two stratospheric flights. The latter ones actually went on for 18 days each, totalling over 36 days of continuous flight with just two take-offs.

From its looks, you would have figured out by now that this isn't a passenger aircraft -- in fact, it looks more like an unmanned glider and that’s exactly the case. It’s designed to help in disaster management operations, monitoring the extent of damage caused by oil spills or wildfires since it can stay up for so long without any hiccups.

It is powered by a dual-propeller system that could easily survive up to six months in the air and would be more environmentally friendly to be launched than a satellite using rockets.

Aerospace firm Airbus has completed two 18-day stratospheric flights of its solar-powered aircraft, called Zephyr, 76,100 feet above the Earth.

Zephyr's solar powered test flights in the stratosphere – the second layer of the Earth's atmosphere – set a new world record for altitude this summer, Airbus says.

The firm now wants to deploy the 'high altitude pseudo-satellite' (HAPS) for surveillance and beaming broadband down to remote areas that don't have internet.

Zephyr, an UAV with two small propellers, is powered exclusively by the Sun, thanks to solar panels lining its whole 82-foot wingspan.

It's typically hand-launched by four to five ground crew, fast-walking or jogging into a light wind, but it features on-board software for remote navigation.

THE AIRBUS ZEPHYR The Zephyr has been built by Airbus Defence and Space engineers. It is powered by the sun during the day, which also recharges its lithium-sulphur batteries to power it by night. Its huge 25m wingspan means it can be launched by four military personnel on their shoulders. The 'psuedo-satellite' can fly at more than 70,000 feet - twice the altitude of a commercial airliner. British military forces will use the high-tech aircraft to monitor targets on the ground from anywhere in the world.

Just one Zephyr provides the coverage of 250 cell towers, so the aircraft therefore saves space on the ground that would otherwise be taken up by bulky infrastructure.

At more than 75,000 feet, Zephyr flies higher than commercial planes (usually up to 40,000 feet), but lower than satellites (200 miles).

Its wingspan of 82 feet (25 metres) is just one third the width of the firm's A380 used for commercial flights, and weighs less than 75kg.

When fully rolled out for clients, it will be cheaper and easier to control than satellites, as well as landed and repurposed for a different mission.

And as it uses sunlight to fly and recharge its batteries, it uses no fuel and produces no carbon emissions. Secondary batteries charge in daylight power overnight flight.

Zephyr could soon be spending around six months in the air at a time, according to Jana Rosenmann, head of unmanned aerial systems at Airbus.

'We have ambitions to be going for periods of months, up to six months,' she told the PA news agency.

'Our batteries are really performing extremely well. I think we're confident right now about (reaching) three months and I would say that going for six months on this air vehicle would not be a problem.

'Have we proved that operationally? No, not yet.

'But all the steps we have been doing in our lab tests are clearly indicating that we are on a very good path.'

Zephyr's second test touched down on September 13 in Arizona, in a demonstration for the Ministry of Defence (MoD).

'Working with Airbus and the Zephyr team during the 2021 flight campaign, significant progress has been made towards demonstrating HAPS as a capability,' said James Gavin, head of future capability group, MoD.

'This summer's activities represent an important step towards operationalising the stratosphere.'

The campaign consisted of six flights in total – four low level test flights and two stratospheric flights.

The stratospheric flights flew for around 18 days each, totaling more than 36 days of stratospheric flight in the campaign.

This adds a further 887 flight hours to the 2,435 stratospheric flight hours for Zephyr to date.

The flight campaign aimed to demonstrate how Zephyr could be used for future operations, flying outside of restricted airspace and over airspace shared with commercial air traffic, away from clouds and jetstreams.

Zephyr is typically hand-launched by four to five ground crew, who fast-walk or jog into a light wind, but it features on-board software for remote navigation

The company is also pitching it for use in disaster zones, and other areas where real-time information is needed.

Airbus says it could revolutionise disaster management, for example, including monitoring the spread of wildfires or oil spills.

'It provides persistent surveillance, tracing the world's changing environmental landscape and will be able to provide communications to the most unconnected parts of the world,' the firm says.

Zephyr's new record-breaking test flights for altitude broke previous records set by the craft in previous years.

But in August 2018, Zephyr S managed to set a world record in its maiden voyage for time in-flight without refueling.

It was able to stay 70,000 feet in the air for 25 days, 23 hours and seven minutes, setting a record for the longest continuous flight in Earth's atmosphere.

According to reports in 2019, Facebook was working on test flights of Zephyr in Australia.

The social media giant had had plans to provide internet connectivity to people worldwide, as part of its so-called Aquila project.

In 2018, Facebook grounded Aquila following 'significant internal turmoil' at the company, but said it would continue to pursue partnerships with firms like Airbus.

In three stages, the “Erfurt” will now become a flying research laboratory

The “Erfurt” is expected to take off from Munich at the end of 2021 for its first flight in the service of climate research

Predicting the weather even more accurately, analyzing climate changes even more precisely, researching even better how the world is developing. This is the goal of a globally unique cooperation between Lufthansa and several research institutes.

Converting an aircraft into a climate research plane poses major challenges. Lufthansa has chosen the most modern and economical long-haul jet in its fleet – an Airbus A350-900 named “Erfurt” (registration D-AIXJ). In three stages, the “Erfurt” will now become a flying research laboratory.

In Lufthansa Technik’s hangar in Malta, the first and most extensive conversion work was carried out. Preparations were made for a complex air intake system below the belly. This was followed by a series of test insertions, at the end of which came the certification of a climate research laboratory weighing around 1.6 tons, the so-called CARIBIC measurement laboratory. The acronym CARIBIC stands for “Civil Aircraft for the Regular Investigation of the atmosphere Based on an Instrument Container”. The project is part of a comprehensive European research consortium.

The “Erfurt” is expected to take off from Munich at the end of 2021 for its first flight in the service of climate research, measuring around 100 different trace gases, aerosol and cloud parameters in the tropopause region (at an altitude of nine to twelve kilometers). Lufthansa is thus making a valuable contribution to climate research, which can use these unique data to assess the performance of current atmospheric and climate models and thus their predictive power for the Earth’s future climate. The special feature: Climate-relevant parameters can be recorded at this altitude with much greater accuracy and temporal resolution on board the aircraft than with satellite-based or ground-based systems.

“The conversion of our A350-900 ‘D-AIXJ’ into a climate research aircraft is something very special for us. We were immediately enthusiastic about the plan to continue CARIBIC on our most fuel-efficient aircraft type. In this way, we can continue to support climate and atmospheric research in its important task on long-haul routes. We are helping to ensure that particularly important climate-relevant parameters are collected just on that altitude where the atmospheric greenhouse effects is largely generated”, says Annette Mann, Head of Corporate Responsibility at the Lufthansa Group. “I am pleased that we can implement this ambitious project together with our partners in record time and thus contribute to improving today’s climate models.”","Lufthansa Airbus A350-900 ""Erfurt"" will become climate research aircraft"

Share this page

The world’s largest commercial airliner was discontinued last year, but the iconic design could now pave the way to environmentally-friendlier air travel.

When Emirates received its 123rd Airbus A380 in December, it marked the end of the line for the biggest passenger plane ever built, just 16 years after launch, with new orders dwindling as a result of advances in technology making newer models more economical, and the pandemic’s devastating impact on global demand.

Now the manufacturer has announced plans to retrofit its super-jumbo, which has a capacity of 525 passengers, with hydrogen fuel technology as part of ongoing efforts to introduce the world’s first zero-emissions aircraft by 2035. The project is a partnership with CFM International – a joint venture involving General Electric division GE Aviation and Safran Aircraft Engines.

Hydrogen-powered gas turbines will be installed between the A380’s two upper level doors, with storage and distribution systems for the fuel located inside the aircraft, which was chosen for the test due to its huge size, which Airbus believes will allow it to better evolve the concept over time.

‘This is key in enabling us to achieve our ambition of having a zero-emission aircraft in commercial service by 2035,’ said Glenn Llewellyn, a leader on aviation climate strategy and VP of Zero Emission Aircraft at Airbus, in a video posted to the company’s YouTube channel.

With global air travel accounting for 915 tonnes of CO2 in 2019 alone, the pressure is on the aviation sector to perfect lower and zero-emission alternatives. Last year, it emerged that Europe’s five largest airports – London Heathrow, Paris Charles de Gaulle, Frankfurt, Amsterdam Schipol and Madrid Barajas – emitted more CO2 than the whole of Sweden.

The company had slashed its workforce as the pandemic disrupted its aircraft production but it is preparing to accelerate output over the next 18 months.

Airbus is also implementing plans to address demand for sustainable aviation, working on decarbonisation projects including new propulsion concepts and the evolution of its aircraft portfolio.

“This can only be achieved by acquiring the right talents in the various domains of expertise that will help us grow our activities as we come out of the crisis,” says Airbus chief human resources officer Thierry Baril.

One-third of the total recruitment will be allocated to young graduates.

Baril says the company is looking to acquiring the “new skills” it needs to operate in the post-pandemic environment, while expanding the diversity of its workforce.

Some 25% of the planned hiring will concentrate on introducing these skills to support Airbus’s long-term ambitions for decarbonisation as well as cybertechnology and digital transformation.

Airbus has “demonstrated resilience” during the crisis, says Baril, and the initial recruitment wave will be global and cover all the company’s businesses.

READ: Qatar Airways award-winning Qsuite

Crosswind landings can be a major challenge for pilots and occur when the wind is across the runway, not head-on.

Typically aircraft land and take off into the wind to decrease the landing or take-off distance.

In some cases aircraft land with a slight downwind component – typically associated with noise-sensitive airports where one runway is preferred over another.

READ: Flying like a billionaire on VistaJet

Where a pilot faces a crosswind landing they need to point the aircraft in the direction of the wind while maintaining a straight course toward the runway.

This is called crabbing or yawing.

In strong crosswinds, the pilot may also dip the wing – sideslip – into the direction of the wind.

Just before touchdown pilots apply rudder to bring the plane – and its undercarriage – back so it is aligned straight down the centerline of the runway.",Pilot of Airbus A340 performs a perfect cross-wind landing

Exactly one year back, Airbus had revealed concepts of new hydrogen-powered zero-emission commercial aircraft that could enter service by 2035. All major Indian carriers except SpiceJet currently have Airbus planes in their fleets.

Speaking during Airbus Summit 2021 here, Faury stated: ""This challenge is not only about an airplane. It is about having the right fuels -- hydrogen at the right time, the right place, the right quantity, and the right price. And that is something that aviation can't manage alone.""

We are more and more confident that this is an achievable goal when it comes to the hydrogen-powered plane, he mentioned. However, since the aircraft manufacturer is working everyday to make the hydrogen-powered zero-emission plane a reality, it has realised that entering this aircraft into service in 2035 is just one of the challenges, he noted.

""Given the number of ruptures and changes that we are going to bring to the aviation sector, we need to onboard the regulators,"" he stated. There are a lot of things that need to be developed, to be decided to be written in terms of rules and regulations on how we are going to use the new fuels in airports and planes, and how we are going to certify the planes, Faury mentioned.

Also, there are obviously a large number of challenges when it comes to safety, reliability, and the way this plane is going to be operated, he said. ""It is collective challenge. But 2035, at the scale of aviation, is tomorrow. Therefore, we have to be fast and we have to be fast together,"" Faury mentioned.

""And we are very happy to gather people from many many different sectors at this summit so that we understand better what needs to be done to be faster together going to that point of having the right fuel, the right planes, the right regulations, so that we can fly net-zero (emission) planes,"" he added.

The two-day long Airbus Summit 2021 was conducted on the topic of ""Pioneering Sustainable Aerospace"". On September 21, Airbus had revealed three models of hydrogen-powered zero-emission commercial aircraft that it plans to bring into service by 2035.

First is the turbofan design that would be capable of operating trans-continentally and would be powered by a modified gas-turbine engine running on hydrogen, rather than jet fuel, through combustion. The second concept is a turboprop design that can carry up to 100 passengers and is powered by hydrogen combustion in modified gas-turbine engines. The turboprop design would be capable of travelling more than 1,000 nautical miles, making it a perfect option for short-haul trips, Airbus had mentioned.

The third concept is a ""blended-wing body"" design, which can carry up to 200 passengers. In this design, the wings merge with the main body of the aircraft. It will be able to operate trans-continentally, Airbus had stated.",Airbus aims to make hydrogen-powered zero-emission commercial aircraft by 2035

Airbus is expecting its new Zero Emission Development Centre (ZEDC) near Bristol will initially support around 50 jobs and be a “key project” in attracting new talent into the UK aerospace sector.

The company announced an event in London last week (May 25) it is set to develop hydrogen technologies at its site in Filton as part of efforts to decarbonise aviation.

Work has already begun in South Gloucestershire on technologies Airbus has said will be “crucial” to the performance of future aircraft powered by liquid hydrogen, which scientists and aerospace experts have said could provide cleaner, more sustainable flight.

The new research hub will look to deliver a “cost-competitive cryogenic fuel system” and support Airbus’ ambition to develop the world's first zero-emission commercial aircraft by 2035.

A spokesperson for Airbus told BusinessLive they expected the centre would employ “around 50 people” in early phases up to 2024.

The number will consist of a mix of existing and new staff, with the project “key” to accelerating the company’s zero-emission ambitions, Airbus said.

The centre adds to Airbus’ existing research and technology footprint in the UK, as well as the work on cryogenic liquid hydrogen tanks being done at the manufacturer’s existing ZEDCs in Spain, Germany, France and Germany.

All Airbus ZEDCs are expected to be fully operational and ready for ground testing with the first fully functional cryogenic hydrogen tank during 2023, and with flight testing starting in 2026.

The firm said its ZEDC in Filton would benefit from a £685m government fund, recently granted over the next three years to national research programme the Aerospace Technology Institute (ATI), to support the development of zero-carbon and ultra-low-emission aircraft technologies.

While it looks like a gust of strong wind would be its undoing, the solar-powered Zephyr is proving its mettle after a successful test campaign saw it establish a new world altitude record during a creditable 36 days of stratospheric flight.

The Airbus experimental drone‘s new world record for this class of unmanned aerial system (UAS) saw it reach an astonishing 76,100ft.

The Arizona test campaign of what Airbus calls its “High Altitude Platform System” (HAPS) was the most ambitious yet and involved four low-level test flights and two stratospheric flights.

READ: Boeing set to launch 777XF at Dubai Air Show?

The stratospheric flights flew for around 18 days each, totaling more than 36 days adding a further 887 flight hours to the 2,435 stratospheric flight hours the aircraft has accumulated so far.

The carbon-neutral UAS uses sunlight to recharge its batteries and is designed to remain in the stratosphere for months at a time.

Airbus predicts it will bring “see, sense and connect capabilities” to both commercial and military customers and has the potential to revolutionize disaster management, including monitoring the spread of wildfires or oil spills.

It marked, according to Airbus, significant progress for a fixed-wing HAPS and a step towards making the stratosphere an operational reality for its customers.

The flights exercised US Federal Aviation Administration flight approvals operating inside the National Airspace System and included a payload that allowed it to stream Earth observation data.

Airbus said the Optical Advanced Earth Observation System was part of a customer focus aimed at demonstrating how Zephyr could be used for future operations, flying outside of restricted airspace and over airspace shared with commercial air traffic.

“Working with Airbus and the Zephyr team during the 2021 flight campaign, significant progress has been made towards demonstrating HAPS as a capability,’’ said James Gavin, the future capability group head at the procurement arm of the UK Ministry of Defence.

“This summer’s activities represent an important step towards operationalizing the stratosphere.”

Airbus UAS head Jana Rosenmann Zephyr had demonstrated “credible and proven ultra-persistence, stratospheric agility, and payload interoperability”.

The Zephyr S has also set a new altitude record for an Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) in its class, soaring to 76,100 feet in the sky over Arizona.

The test campaign carried out in 2021 consisted of six flights in total, four low-altitude test flights, and two stratospheric flights.

Weighing in at 75 kg (165 lb), the Zephyr S is the largest of the Zephyr line with a wingspan of 28 meters (92 ft). The solar-powered stratosphere drone can carry a payload of can only carry a 5 kg payload; this is enough to support the company’s Optical Advanced Earth Observation system for Zephyr (OPAZ) payload for streaming Earth observation data. Besides, the aircraft remain aloft for up to 26 days without landing thanks to Amprius lithium-ion battery packs totaling 24 kg (53 lb). The batteries are charged during the day by thin, flexible, high-efficiency gallium-arsenide solar cells mounted on the wings.

During the flight, Zephyr can transmit internet signals to the military and civilians in case they do not have access to a cable connection. The device will provide the potential to revolutionize disaster management, including monitoring the spread of wildfires or oil spills. It provides persistent surveillance, tracing the world’s changing environmental landscape, and will be able to provide communications to the most unconnected parts of the world.

Typically, a series of satellites are used to provide a wireless global Internet connection, which is delivered to low-earth orbit using launch vehicles. Airbus has focused on a cheaper alternative that runs on electric motors and is therefore completely environmentally friendly.

All one needs to see it is a short walk down the aisle of the new Airbus A350-1000 that flew from Abu Dhabi to Paris on Thursday (March 31) morning.

The subtle changes in the cabin – deftly done while the industry acclimatised itself to serving passengers in the aftermath of COVID-19 – are hand-in-hand with the significant leap the Abu Dhabi-based carrier has taken in its green goals.

With a better seat load factor, the aircraft is more economical, and consumes 25 per cent less fuel compared to its predecessors.

But that alone is not what sets the plane apart. It’s the beginning of a greater push towards sustainability flying – the airline has five A350-1000 in its fleet, and 12 may join soon.

“Shutting airlines down because of the pandemic is easy. Getting them back up is tough, it’s a step-by-step process,” Terry Daly, Executive Director Guest Experience, Brand and Marketing, told Gulf News.

“But we took it in our stride. COVID-19 was a good time to rethink what we wanted to offer to our passengers, to refurbish the planes’ interiors, such as upholstery and panels, and be prepared once services resume in full strength.”

One look around the new plane, and you know it’s a job well done. The Business class seats are enabled with wireless charging, just like we have in the latest cars. (No need to borrow charging cables any longer...)

The seats also have a shoulder strap seat belt, like those seen in automobiles. Three hidden panels with adequate storage space means less clutter on the seat.

Return to profit

The airline, which sharply cut its losses in 2021, is likely to return to profit in 2023, said Daly, who joined the airline in March 2020, just a few days before the Covid-triggered lockdowns struck. Etihad recorded a sharp drop in losses in 2021 at $476 million compared to a loss of $1.70 billion in the year-ago period.

We will resume many of the services and start new ones this year. Passenger demand is already growing, and we hope it will multiply further in the coming quarters - Terry Daly, Executive Director Guest Experience, Brand and Marketing at Etihad Airways

Healthy competition

The UAE may be home to several full-service budget carriers, but there’s space for everyone.

“I don’t see any consolidation happening. Everyone has their own space,” Daly said when asked if the country has too many airlines operating out of it.

“The airlines cater to different cities. The smaller carriers link to cities that the larger ones don’t, and vice-versa. They create a new market for the UAE airlines and help serve the country as a hub for travellers across the world. Smaller carriers have opened up routes that UAE didn’t have earlier.”

Masks will remain for some time

Six months ago the airframer unveiled proposed designs for zero-emissions aircraft, including a blended-wing body concept alongside more conventional twinjet and turboprop configurations.

“We think it’s going to happen,” said Faury, speaking during a Eurocontrol-hosted event on 30 March. “These are different architectures we’re looking at – among others – these are the main ones we’re looking at for future hydrogen aircraft.”

Faury says the blended-wing concept is “very interesting”, because it is “well-suited for a high volume of fuel inside the aircraft” – pointing out that hydrogen is “bulky” compared with kerosene-based fuel.

“To go a certain distance need more volume of fuel on board and that’s why we’re looking at different architectures,” he states.

Faury believes the 2035 timeframe for entry-into-service “makes sense” because it gives the aerospace industry five years to mature the technology.

He says the industry is “working on that now, big time”.

Another two years would be necessary to prepare to launch an aircraft programme – sourcing funding and finding production locations – before a formal launch around 2027-28, giving another seven or eight years before introduction to service.

“That’s very credible,” says Faury. “It doesn’t mean all solutions are on the table.”

Although hydrogen is “not a new technology”, he says, a “lot of engineering” is necessary to adapt it safely and reliably to commercial aerospace.

Faury also stresses that a new regulatory framework is required, as well as a “level playing-field” for those regulations, plus “large quantities of decarbonised hydrogen at airports” by 2035.

“Obviously we’re far from being there,” he says. But he adds that there is “big momentum” on hydrogen technology in a number of industries. “We think that’s really good to see, very encouraging,” he says.",Mid-2030s zero-emission aircraft horizon 'credible': Airbus chief

A new £40m research and test facility will accelerate the design, manufacture and eventual operation of zero-emission aircraft, Airbus has said.

Jointly funded by the government’s Aerospace Technology Institute programme and the aerospace multinational, the Aerospace Integrated Research and Test Centre (Airtec) opened today (3 June) in Filton, Bristol.

Covering the equivalent of two football pitches, Airtec is designed for structural testing of large-scale aircraft assemblies, from full-size wings down to individual components and materials used in aircraft design. Facilities include a 14m by 10m strong wall capable of testing wings with force equivalent to the weight of 240 cars.

“It provides the most advanced working environment and tools for Airbus alongside external suppliers, partners, and academia, to deliver the next generation of aircraft wing, landing-gear systems and fuel system designs,” an Airbus announcement said.

The centre will also aid the company’s design, manufacture, testing, certification and commercial operation of new zero-emission aircraft, with plans for ‘sustained investment’ in R&D. Airbus said the facility is ‘central’ to its Wing of Tomorrow programme, which is exploring the best materials, manufacturing, and assembly techniques for more fuel-efficient aircraft.

Universities and companies in other sectors – such as maritime and nuclear – will also be able to use the centre, which includes labs and collaborative office space.

Kwasi Kwarteng, the secretary of state for business, energy and industrial strategy, formally launched the centre. He said: “These top-class research and testing facilities will be used to continue the spirit of innovation for which we are world-renowned, and will produce the cleaner, more efficient flights of tomorrow.

“This is great news, not just for Filton but for the rest of the UK, which will benefit from jobs in the supply chain. I am proud of the government’s support for the centre’s construction, showing we are leaving no stone unturned in our drive to make the aviation industry cleaner.”

Airbus employs about 2,800 people at its site in Filton. The company is the largest commercial aerospace company in the UK, as well as its biggest civil aerospace exporter, employing more than 13,500 people at 25 sites across the country.

An Airbus plane powered by used cooking oil and waste fat has completed its first flight.

The A380 aircraft took off from Toulouse, in France, and flew for about three hours, according to the aerospace giant, which has a major UK base in Filton.

According to Airbus, the plane's Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engine used 100% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to fly. SAF is non-fossil derived and is being used to replace traditional fuels in the aviation industry in a bid to reduce carbon emissions.

Some 27 tonnes of unblended SAF, which primarily consisted of used cooking oil as well as other waste fats, was used for the flight. The SAF was provided by French multinational integrated oil and gas company Total Energies and was produced in Normandy.

A second flight with the same aircraft is scheduled to take place from Toulouse to Nice Airport, on Tuesday (March 29) to test the use of SAF during take-off and landing.

It is the third Airbus aircraft type to fly on 100% SAF over the course of 12 months; the first was an Airbus A350 in March 2021 followed by an A319neo single-aisle aircraft in October last year.

An Airbus spokesperson said: “Increasing the use of SAF remains a key pathway to achieving the industry’s ambition of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Key statistics outlined in the Waypoint 2050 report indicate that SAF could contribute between 53% and 71% of required carbon reductions.”

All Airbus aircraft are currently certified to fly with up to a 50% blend of SAF mixed with kerosene. The aim is to achieve certification of 100% SAF by the end of the decade.

The A380 aircraft used during the test is the same aircraft recently revealed as Airbus’ ZEROe Demonstrator - a flying testbed for future technologies that will be instrumental in bringing the world’s first zero-emission aircraft to market by 2035.",Airbus A380 plane powered by cooking oil and waste fat completes flight

The trial took place in the United States in August, when the Zephyr S aircraft undertook approx. 18-day stratospheric flights to test various capabilities.

Carrying an onboard radio transmitter, the Zephyr S provided an agile datalink during a stratospheric flight to simulate future direct-to-device connectivity. Test data was captured at different altitudes and at different times of day and night, focusing on assessing how connectivity is affected in the stratosphere by factors including weather conditions, different elevation angles and aircraft flight patterns.

Tests included various bandwidths to simulate direct-to-device service from the HAPS to end users using low, nominal and high throughput. The demonstration confirmed the viability and versatility of the 2GHz spectrum for HAPS-based services and also the use of a narrow (450MHz) band to provide connectivity in a range of up to 140km.

The measurement and analysis of the propagation of radio waves transmitted from Zephyr demonstrated the feasibility of stratospheric communications to devices such as smartphones. Based on the results of this experiment, Airbus and NTT DOCOMO aims to provide communication services to mountainous areas, remote islands, and maritime areas where radio waves are difficult to reach.

As part of efforts to further advance 5G and prepare for 6G, ""coverage expansion"" to expand communication networks to any location, including air and sea, is being studied worldwide. To achieve this, non-terrestrial network (NTN) technology is expected to be used. In addition to coverage of the air and sea, stratospheric HAPS networking will be useful for disaster preparedness and many industrial use cases, for example, to increase communication capacity in densely populated areas such as event venues, and remotely controlling heavy equipment at construction sites.

The test data will be used to inform future LTE direct-to-device services that are expected to be provided via the Airbus Zephyr HAPS solution.

Takehiro Nakamura, General Manager of DOCOMO's 6G-IOWN Promotion Department

DOCOMO believes that HAPS will be a promising solution for coverage expansion in 5G evolution and 6G. In this measurement experiment, we were able to demonstrate the effectiveness of HAPS, especially for direct communication to smartphones, through long-term propagation measurements using actual HAPS equipment.","Airbus, DOCOMO Test Solar-powered Zephyr HAPS for 5G/6G Connectivity"

""Apple today announced a major acceleration of its work to expand recycled materials across its products, including a new 2025 target to use 100 percent recycled cobalt1 in all Apple-designed batteries,"" the company stated Thursday.

In addition to this, magnets in Apple devices will use entirely recycled rare earth elements by 2025, and all Apple-designed printed circuit boards will use 100 percent recycled tin soldering and gold plating.

A carbon neutral future

It comes as part of Apple's broader push to make every Apple product, from its best iPhones to its Apple TV, carbon neutral by 2030. Apple noted that last year it ""significantly expanded"" its use of recycled materials, and now sources ""over two-thirds of all aluminum, nearly three-quarters of all rare earths, and more than 95 percent of all tungsten in Apple products from 100 percent recycled material.""

The 100 percent Cobalt target for batteries is quite ambitious given only a quarter of cobalt in Apple products last year was recycled, and only 13 percent the year before. Cobalt is used in batteries found in your iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, MacBook, and more.

The aforementioned circuit board targets will affect the circuitry connecting components like the logic board, cameras, and more in your favorite devices.

Apple is also tackling plastic and only has 4 percent plastic remaining in its packaging footprint, with labels and lamination key areas to tackle. Apple says it has developed new printing methods to print more information directly onto the boxes of iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro, while new overprint varnish found on the iPad Air, iPad Pro, and Apple Watch Series 8 reduces the plastic lamination found on these boxes.

Based on the company's new pledge, it seems like sustainability is being taken seriously, to be honest. The company something has been working really hard to ensure that it leaves the least amount of carbon footprint, and the new vision that the company has makes one think that removing the charger from the box was just a tiny step.

Apple has a lot of cool, new technologies in place to ensure better sustainability as the company takes more steps toward going green

So what's new this time around? Apple has pledged that all the batteries the company will design will be made out of 100% recycled cobalt. At the same time, all the magnets found in devices will be made using 100 percent recycled rare earth elements, and last but not least, all the PCB (printed circuit boards) found in Apple devices will be using recycled gold plating and tin soldering.

Another step that Apple has taken is that it has started using augmented reality (AR) systems. These systems are going to help the company's recycling partners have an easier time disassembling various Apple devices, all thanks to video imagery that will be projected directly onto the work surface. I do understand that this might be confusing for some people but think of it as that scene from the original Iron Man (2008) where Tony Stark starts drawing up the concept of his Mark II suit. While Apple is not making manned suits, I do like how this implementation is done because it will help the engineers have a much easier time disassembling the devices.

Last but not least, Apple has also talked about how by 2025, it will completely stop using plastics in its packaging. Instead, the company will be going for fiber alternatives to screen films, wraps, and foam. 96% of the packaging is already plastic-free, and the company is working on ensuring that whatever is left is also taken care of.

Although it might look like a rudimentary statement, I am honestly really happy that Apple is taking such steps to ensure that the environment is in a much better condition. This is also a message for other companies to start working harder towards making this world a better, more habitable place for everyone.

Image: Apple TV+

""Extrapolations,"" a new, star-studded Apple TV+ series, depicts humanity’s future under ever-worsening — yet largely realistic — climate change scenarios in strikingly ambitious ways.

Why it matters: The series is arguably the most far-reaching and experimental portrayal of climate change yet attempted. It sputters in some respects, with characters weaving in and out of episodes in sometimes confusing arcs.

But it is startlingly well-grounded in climate science, and specifically references likely consequences of higher emissions scenarios from U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports.

Driving the news: Creator, producer and writer Scott Z. Burns told Axios in an interview that the show explores the “messy middle” of the climate story.

Now available for streaming, ""Extrapolations"" is not an end-of-days, apocalyptic disaster series, where nothing can yet be done to rein in global warming.

Rather, it examines timeframes in which humans still have some agency to shift course on greenhouse gas emissions.

In just the first episode, you’ll find a U.N. climate summit taking place, as well as a detailed discussion of China’s observer status in the Arctic Council.

For climate professionals, it may be a show that stays with you long after it is finished, be it a rabbi struggling to save his congregation’s place of worship in a sinking Miami; or a frighteningly realistic rogue geo-engineering (featuring Edward Norton).

Zoom in: Burns, known for producing Al Gore’s “An Inconvenient Truth” and serving as a writer on “The Report” as well as “Contagion,” said he was most heavily influenced by an essay by Amitav Ghosh called the “Great derangement.”

He also consulted with Gore, along with climate activist and writer Bill McKibben, former NASA climate scientist James Hansen, among others.

Burns aimed to tell the story of climate change at different time periods and from different perspectives, reflecting the fact that its effects vary widely depending on one’s economic circumstances, race and class status. In this way, the show shines a spotlight on climate justice.

What he's saying: “I was really interested in the kinds of stories that were going to occur in the messy middle, not the post apocalyptic moment, not in the final analysis, but in the human sized increments that a person might experience, that a couple might experience that a child and a parent might experience,” Burns said.

Co-producer and writer Dorothy Fortenberry said she and Burns made an effort to tell stories during the time period when decisions made by characters near the beginning of the show continued to have ramifications near the end, which is in line with climate science findings.

Between the lines: Both Burns and Fortenberry told Axios they hope that this show will inspire other creators in Hollywood to tackle climate change on film and television.

“This is one show, this is one way to do this,” Burns said. “I hope that we put a little crack in our industry, and other people will pry it apart further.”

The bottom line: You may find the dialogue in this show lingering in your head as you process it, especially if you work in the climate space.","Apple TV's new drama ""Extrapolations"" is a climate cautionary tale"

APPLE BLOSSOMS, not apple pie, that traditional treat of mid-summer, nor apple cider, the beloved autumn beverage, are what's on our apple-loving minds when spring begins. But sometimes the pleasures of late summer and fall can cameo in the floweriest season, thanks to the fact that April is a half year from October and several ""Halfway to Halloween"" events pop up on the calendar. For autumn aficionados, this is super: It's like a postcard from their favorite season, well before that time of year makes its anticipated arrival. And here's one postcard that pomme lovers can get stoked over as springtime deepens: The Gravenstein Apple Fair, that apple-y extravaganza that graces Sebastopol each August, just announced its August event.

HAPPY 50TH: And the 2023 to-do is special, for the homespun festival, which includes lives tunes, craft brews, appearances by cute barnyard critters, cider, the popular ""Apple Alley,"" and lots more, is marking a milestone. ""We're excited to throw the biggest party in our 50-year history,"" said Executive Director and Gravenstein Apple Fair Producer, Carmen Snyder. ""This year we're honoring the foresight of our founding farmers and their vision to preserve agriculture in Sonoma County. We're also delighted to showcase the next generation of inspiring farmers and ranchers who are meeting the moment and cultivating a more resilient food system through regenerative agricultural practices.""

When Sienna Miller arrived on the set of Extrapolations for the first day of filming in October 2021, a Native American shaman came to bless the grounds. There were no printed signs directing her where to go, or stacks of paper scripts available for producers to scribble their notes in the margins. Instead, there were clothing racks filled with thrifted and vintage garments sustainably sourced by the costume department, water stations for refilling nonplastic bottles, compostable plates and utensils, and plant-based craft services. It was the greenest set the actress says she’s ever been on.

“It was really environmentally conscious, and that was a treat,” says Miller. “I’ve been on sets with bamboo stools, but nothing to the degree that this was.”

That difference was intentional on the part of Scott Z. Burns, writer, director and creator of the new Apple TV+ series, and executive producers Dorothy Fortenberry and Media Res’ Michael Ellenberg.

“Dorothy and I, along with Media Res and Apple, felt that if we were going to make this show, we needed to try and make it in the way that the subject matter required of us,” says Burns.

All filming took place throughout New York City’s five boroughs, drastically reducing the project’s carbon footprint. But the greatest success of the production, which employed the help of Green Spark Group, a consulting firm that trains filmmakers on how to reduce their environmental impact during production, was simply demonstrating what’s possible when it comes to how we engage with the Earth and with each another.

Which is precisely the point of Extrapolations. Rather than fixate on hypotheticals about what the planet might be like if humans continue on our current path or depict a distant, apocalyptic-like universe, the eight-episode drama drops viewers in near-future societies around the world where its characters’ entire relationship to one another revolves around the climate issues many believe we still have the luxury to ignore. And that, in and of itself, is terrifying, says Yara Shahidi, another member of the star-studded cast.

“I think that this series asks a question in a really helpful way, which is, As much as you may think of it as an extreme imagining of the future, is it really all that extreme? Is it really all that unrealistic?”

Daveed Diggs in Extrapolations Courtesy of Apple TV+

Extrapolations begins in the year 2037 with climate activists protesting Alpha Industries, a tech company that claims economies will fail if corporations such as theirs aren’t allowed to develop technologies that will raise average temperatures more than 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels — which scientists say is the cutoff to avoid climate catastrophe — in the short term in order to remedy ecological issues in the long term. The argument sets the stage for the theme of environment versus enterprise that plays out in the series.

Kit Harington plays Alpha CEO Nicholas Bilton. “He’s obviously shaped around a few different people in our consciousness right now,” says Harington. “You could pick any one of those kinds of tech billionaires and decide that’s who he’s based on. But really, he’s his own invention. It’s this idea of someone who is ultra-capitalist and very motivated by the free market and believes that they can save the world through capitalism and all of the issues that come with it.”

It’s also during this episode that audiences are introduced to two of the characters who’ll humanize the threat of environmental calamity: newly appointed youth Rabbi Marshall Zucker (Daveed Diggs) and marine biologist Rebecca Shearer (Miller).

“The fame of the cast was important because we wanted characters and actors that the audience would immediately connect to and feel for,” says Ellenberg. “We wanted to collapse the distance from this issue, and with these famous actors you’re there automatically.”

Episode two, “Whale Fall,” set in 2046, finds Shearer in Cali, Colombia, working as a species archivist for a company called Menagerie 2100. She’s developed a relationship with Eve, the last humpback whale on earth, who’s on a forlorn quest to find a mate after losing all four of her children. She shares this desire with Shearer, who’s able to communicate with Eve by assigning her the voice of her late mother, played by Meryl Streep.

“It was extraordinary to watch her work because she can be having a laugh one minute and then suddenly, she gives the greatest emotional performance you’ve ever seen take place and it’s so grounded in truth,” Miller says of Streep. “Because she’s so open and available, it just inspires something in return.”

The thread of parenthood and loss is personal to Burns, whose passion for saving humpback whales dates back to the second grade when he first helped raise money for the cause.

“I think the fact that my father was dying while I was writing that episode made me think a lot about my childhood and about saying goodbye and the idea of, What would it be like to do an exit interview with the last whale?” he says. “What would they say about us?”

In the midst of her grief, Shearer’s also managing 9-year-old son Ezra’s “summer heart,” an illness that requires him to limit his time outdoors. It’s one of several presently fictitious, yet futuristically plausible conditions brought on by global warming — along with “heat rage” and even earlier onset dementia — that shows up in the series.

“We talked to different scientists and experts about potential realities,” explains Fortenberry. “We asked, ‘How will climate change affect agriculture? How will it affect real estate? How will it affect cities? How will it affect politics?’ What we were able to do was come up with potential worlds that really unfolded in ways that surprised us.”

One such world is that of adult Ezra (Tahar Rahim), now living in London in the year 2066, which is explored in episode six, titled “Lola.” Facing cognitive decline, having outlived his summer heart diagnosis, Ezra relies on a technology known as “Cache Cloud” to keep his most precious memories alive. However, when the cost of the service increases after an earthquake causes the servers to crash, he’s forced to make difficult decisions about which moments to preserve.

It’s through his work with a personnel application known as Pack that he meets Natasha (Gemma Chan), a single mother who uses the platform to provide a father figure for her daughter after her biological dad disappears. Using technology and his command of multiple languages, Ezra is able to assume the appearance of different individuals whom he’s hired to impersonate for various purposes, from human connection to confessing wrongdoings. With most clients, the job is merely a task to check off his daily to-do list, but he finds himself forming a bond with Natasha.

“They’re grieving, they’ve both lost their respective loves of their lives, they’re yearning for connection. and, really, against the odds, they’re falling for each other,” says Chan. “I found it really interesting, this idea that in society at that time, everything will have become so divided and fragmented that we’re connecting in this kind of way.”

There’s a desperation that comes over Ezra, however, when no amount of money or technology proves sufficient to keep his memories safe, with Cache Cloud servers continuing to overheat as temperatures soar to 2.32°C above pre-industrial levels. Ultimately, he’s forced to assess what he’s sacrificing to cling to a life that’s no longer his.

“One of the themes of the episode is about letting go and being in the present and that conflict that we all have — whether we’re looking too much into the future or still trapped by the past — of, How can we be completely present and focused on now?” adds Chan. “I think that’s relevant to your romantic life, but also every area of your life.”

Beyond depicting how climate change could upend individual lives on an intimate level, the series also zooms out to the larger, geopolitical landscape. Ecocide — widespread, long-term and severe destruction of the natural environment that’s brought on by either deliberate or negligent human action — is a concept that originated in the 1970s following the Vietnam War. While 10 nations have domestic laws criminalizing ecocide, only one of which — France — is a Western country, there’s currently no international law that bans the practice in peacetime. In Extrapolations, world leaders can no longer afford to overlook how the devastation brought on by increasing global temperatures affects countries in disparate ways.

In episode one, representatives from Algeria and Palestine make pleas to France for access to water, which they argue will also slow the increase in refugee migration. In episode five, set in Mumbai in the year 2059, a nationwide drought resulting from extreme temperatures has rendered stolen goods from the Svalbard Global Seed Vault in the Arctic useless. The predicament calls into question whether the illegal practice of geoengineering, foreshadowed in the prior episode, would be justified if it could bring back the rain needed to germinate the unmarked seeds, even if it played into the hands of controversial billionaire inventor Gita Mishra (Indira Varma).

All the while, Alpha Industries continues to develop technologies that Bilton argues satisfy the basic human desire for convenience.

“So as far as he’s concerned, he’s trying to do right by everyone,” Harington explains. “He thinks his company is the company to help the emerging climate crisis. The trouble is that, like with anyone who spends their life at the top of a company such as that, things get distorted in his mind and money enters in an unhealthy way into his motivation.”

It’s that acknowledged propensity to place comfort above climate concerns that gives audiences an opportunity to take a look at their own choices. (In one scene, a government official confesses, “I feel like I traded the future for the present.”) It’ll be an international court, however, and not individuals’ own consciences, that will decide the cost of doing so.

“If God made humans in his image, why do they suck? Or did we just evolve into sucking?” a precocious preteen (Neska Rose) asks Rabbi Zucker as they stand in the middle of a synagogue in Miami, wearing rain boots due to the persistent sea level rise in episode three, “The Fifth Question.”

“I wanted to write something that was broadly about what we do in society when the stories and the myths that we tell each other at home or in church or in synagogue begin to fray at the edges. Because the world that exists in those stories is also fraying at the edges,” explains Burns.

The episode, which stars Diggs and David Schwimmer as two practicing Jewish men with conflicting agendas for the climate-displaced, is inspired by the Coen brothers’ 2009 black comedy A Serious Man and is one of several ways Burns plays with various genres throughout the series. Episode four, “Face of God,” starring Edward Norton, which Burns co-wrote with novelist Dave Eggers, draws from Sidney Lumet’s 1964 Cold War thriller Fail Safe, written by Walter Bernstein. Burns likens episode seven, which he crafted with playwright Bess Wohl, to Edward Albee’s 1966 play, Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?

“I remember saying to Michael and Dorothy, ‘You should be able to take a story as fundamental as Romeo and Juliet and ask, so how does that change in a climate-changed world?’ — because all the stories that we know were written for a climate that no longer exists.”

In the penultimate episode, “The Going Away Party,” set in San Francisco in 2068, Sylvie (Marion Cotillard) invites Nic (Tobey Maguire) and his much younger girlfriend, Elodie (Eiza González), over for a New Year’s Eve feast with her husband, Auggie (Forest Whitaker), that costs them six carbon credits. It’s more than they can afford, which is why Sylvie, in her floor-length formal gown, tells Anna, the help she’s hired for the night — who has to wear an oxygen mask as she treks through the street to make it to the couple’s walk-up apartment — not to expect a tip.

During dinner, Auggie reveals he’s won a lottery that allows members of society’s upper echelon to upload themselves into a digitized cloud to be awakened at a later date when the world is in a happier and healthier state. He shares his desire to take advantage of the opportunity without first consulting his wife — an indicator of the state of their marriage. What follows is a meltdown on the part of Sylvie that’s so impetuous you can’t help but laugh as it unfolds onscreen.

“That’s her strength,” González says of Nicole Holofcener, who directed the episode. “She really understands how to bring out the comedy and absurdity of certain situations.”

Still, there’s an equal level of realism in uncovering how interpersonal relationships will be affected by individual responses to the new way of living brought on by climate change.

“What I loved about the episode is it allowed for deep conversations on-set,” adds González. “Marion comes from a completely different culture growing up in France, and me in Mexico, and with Forest and Tobey there’s all of these different years, times and places in the world, and we had to figure out, How does that intertwine? These conversations really bled into our lives on a daily basis.”

The final episode of season one of Extrapolations opens with a scene of Grammy Award-winning Blues musician Ben Harper singing a pared-down version of Marvin Gaye’s “Mercy Mercy Me (The Ecology)” onstage. The year is 2070, the average global temperature has increased by 2.59°C, and the reality predicted in the song’s 1971 lyrics have been fully actualized.

Where did all the blue skies go?

Poison is the wind that blows

“It’s important that people learn that Marvin Gaye’s ‘Mercy Mercy Me’ is kind of the first song that brought awareness to this issue,” says Burns. “Once you understand that, you begin to learn that this issue shows up in people’s lives in different ways, and it’s not surprising that frontline communities often experience this in ways that aren’t on the weather report.”

Burns’ words speak to the personalization of environmental issues that defines Extrapolations and underlines its effectiveness. The hope, says Chan, is that “people are moved, entertained and perhaps a little bit scared” after watching the series.

The creators also want viewers to be galvanized to act. “When I describe the series, people are like, ‘OK, so do we fix it or don’t we?’ ‘Do we win or do we lose?’ And that’s not the question,” says Fortenberry. “It’s not a binary. It’s an ongoing, unfolding event that we’re all going to be living through, and we’re all going to be influencing, and there will be challenges and opportunities at every turn.”

In fact, many of them are already here.

“My daughter watched the trailer and said, ‘The reality is, this is not far away,’ adds Miller. “It’s probably a decade too late that we’re making this show, but how wonderful that there’s a platform to tell it.”","The Making of Star-Studded Climate Drama ‘Extrapolations’: “I Hope People Are Moved, Entertained and Perhaps a Little Bit Scared”"

The new Apple store is a perfect blend of fine architecture, great consumer experience and is in line with company's environment-friendly policies. It's everything Apple stores stand for and aims to provide the best shopping experience to Apple customers.

“At Apple, our customers are at the center of everything we do, and our teams are excited to celebrate this wonderful moment with them as we open our first retail store in India,” said Deirdre O’Brien, Apple’s senior vice president of Retail. “Apple BKC is a reflection of Mumbai’s vibrant culture and brings together the best of Apple in a beautiful, welcoming space for connection and community.”

We, at India Today Tech and FIIBER, were among the very firsts to enter the new Apple Store. The store will open for public on Tuesday, April 18 at 11 am IST. But, here is what you should expect.

A one of its kind store

The Apple BKC almost feels like a college library -- with benches for customers to sit and experience the Apple products -- a lot of sunlight coming through the windows with the only difference of local Mumbai music playing in the background. It is definitely a place you can spend hours experiencing the products or just sitting around, working on your laptop.

The design of the store is inspired from the local Kaali Peeli Mumbai Taxi art. It features a triangular handcrafted timber ceiling that extends beyond the glass façade to the underside of the exterior canopy. Apple has used a total of 1000 tiles on this ceiling which consist of 4,50,000 individual timber elements, all of which were assembled in Delhi.

The next thing you see after entering the store is a stainless-steel staircase which connects the ground floor to the first level. Other than this, there are two stone walls sourced from Rajasthan which just add to the beauty of the store.

Every Apple product on showcase

With the opening of the Apple store, customers won't have to worry about the shortage of products. They can simply walk in and buy their desired Apple product or accessory - in almost any colour they want. They will also be able to hold these products, use them and get the required assistance around them.

The store has display tables and avenues featuring the latest iPhone, Mac, iPad, AirPods, Apple Watch, and Apple TV line-ups, as well as accessories like AirTag. Apple BKC also offers Apple Pickup, which allows users to order Apple products online and pick them up from the store itself.

On top of it, the store will have 100 Apple members available to help the customers. These members can collectively speak over 20 languages and will be able to help customers around the world, helping them learn about Apple products and offering advice on the Apple Trade in program.

Environment-friendly approach

It's incredible that the entire Apple store in Mumbai will run on renewable energy. Apple claims that the Apple BKC is designed to be one of the most energy-efficient Apple Store locations in the world, with a dedicated solar array and zero reliance on fossil fuels for store operations.

Additionally, the store is operationally carbon neutral as part of Apple’s commitment to turn the company carbon neutral by 2030.

The wild custard apple is one of a number of “forgotten food crops” identified as being potentially instrumental in adapting future food systems to climate change.

Researchers at Scotland’s Rural College (SRUC), the World Vegetable Center, World Agroforestry and partner institutions have modelled how nutrient-rich forgotten food crops – crops not promoted in recent decades with the dominance of major staples – could help diversify future food systems to make them more climate-resilient and healthier.

The research, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA, considered the case of sub-Saharan Africa, where the need to support food and nutritional security is high and where there any many potential forgotten food crops that could be more widely grown. Like elsewhere in the world, Africa’s climate is getting hotter, and weather events like floods and droughts are increasing, and this means that agriculture must adapt.

Climate niche modelling was used to prioritise 58 forgotten food crops from seven different food groups including fruits, leafy vegetables, pulses and cereals that have the highest potential to contribute to healthy climate-proof cropping systems of the African major staples of maize, rice, cassava and yams to the year 2070.

Dr Ian Dawson, a reader at SRUC, explained: “Africa already has massive problems in achieving sufficient nutritious food supply, and climate change is expected to make the situation a lot worse. Colleagues at the World Vegetable Center and World Agroforestry are committed to supporting the diversification of Africa’s food systems with a range of healthy foods.”

Lead author Maarten van Zonneveld from the World Vegetable Center said: “Of the 58 prioritised forgotten food crops, many are annuals and tree fruits rich in Vitamin A and C, and a large number are vegetables high in Vitamin A, iron, folate and zinc. Our study shows that in most locations where major staples are currently grown in sub-Saharan Africa, one or more forgotten food crops from the different food groups will be suitable for cultivation under 2070 climate conditions and can diversify major staples to support more nutrient-rich diets.”

Dawson added: “Although our paper looks at future food systems for Africa, there is no reason why similar climate-niche modelling methods should not be applied to forgotten foods in other parts of the world, and that includes Europe and the UK. Already, the UK is thinking about how to introduce or reintroduce unusual legume, cereal and vegetable crops into production, to reduced greenhouse gas emissions by providing alternative sources of protein to meat, and to create healthier diets. So these moves would also help adapt our food system to the future climate we anticipate.

“The special thing about our current research was that we not only modelled crop distributions, but we looked at the nutritional value of the crops and therefore more directly how their production affects diets, which is a crucial factor in support of micronutrient supply ‘beyond calories’ that current staple crops provide. In the UK recently, we have seen the problems of getting access to healthful salad crops, for example.

“As we note in the paper, the climate modelling we have done is of course only an initial step in supporting food system diversification, and many other considerations are needed to design future food systems and put these designs into practice. We need to work with producers and consumers to find out what works in bringing about useful change, but our modelling is a useful step on the way.”",Custard apple ‘among climate change solutions’ in Africa

Hollywood has long mined global warming to create terrifying scenarios of apocalyptic futures. Some of these aren’t very realistic. Others are all preaching and no teaching. But the new Apple TV drama series “Extrapolations” takes a different, more science-steeped approach; the episodes cascade through the future of this century, using real scientific projections and computer-generated special effects to show how global warming might play out under the most likely scenario.

It’s a projection based on humanity continuing to chip away at the emissions problem; not ignoring it but not making any great leaps of progress either.

Each episode takes on a year between 2037 and 2070; a future many of us will inhabit. People go on with life, but with a backdrop of new landscapes and weather patterns that look increasingly different from our current world. The show was created by Scott Burns, who is known for the 2011 pandemic drama “Contagion” and for work on Al Gore’s 2006 global warming documentary “An Inconvenient Truth.”

Last week, at a panel discussion held as part of Yale University’s Environmental Film Festival, one of the show’s writers and producers, Dorothy Fortenberry, said they wanted to avoid the post-apocalyptic plot with heroes struggling for survival. They went for the middle of our current range of scientific predictions; a planet that is warmer by 2.5 or 3 degrees Celsius and the weather and sea level changes that likely come with that.

“It’s what will happen if we keep muddling through … the way we’re muddling through now,” said Fortenberry.

We’ve already warmed the planet by more than 1 degree Celsius, and climate scientists tend to agree that anything over 1.5 will cause major disruptions. There’s consensus that to be safe we should try to keep global warming under that mark, though 2 degrees is a more realistic goal, and even that will require major changes in the way we consume energy.

The show’s scientific accuracy looks good to climate scientist Michael Mann of the University of Pennsylvania, who has studied how global warming will manifest itself in extreme weather. Mann says he thinks the climate we’ve created is plenty dramatic already, with Australia burning, California burning and then flooding, and record heat waves killing unsuspecting people in normally cool places such as Seattle and London. (Mann was cited by Leonardo DiCaprio as an inspiration for his character in the 2021 satire “Don’t Look Up,” in which scientists try to warn the public about a killer comet, an allegory for global warming.)

“Extrapolations” depicts bigger floods, stronger hurricanes and more fires; with more smoke pollution. Cities have built seawalls to keep back the tides. There’s a global geoengineering scheme, pulled off by a rogue scientist, and it has its own unintended consequences.

Mann says that more warming is likely to intensify these kinds of extreme events. How much the sea rises is harder to predict, but given that many coastal areas are already having trouble with flooding, it’s plausible there will be more in 2046.

Despite the scientific accuracy, many critics panned the series, calling it patronizing and predictable, as well as sappy and sermonizing. One suggested that it would have been better if the producers had gotten rid of the actors entirely. And yes, it was often hard to care about the human characters; even though the plight of a doomed whale was genuinely heartbreaking.

One of the panelists at the Yale event, Anna Jane Joyner, of the climate consulting nonprofit Good Energy, says Hollywood often tries to get people to eat broccoli by promising chocolate. She suggested that the entertainment industry is wrong to equate global warming with broccoli.

She’s certainly right in the case of “Extrapolations.” The part of the series that’s educational and science-based is fun to watch, even addictive. It’s the chocolate. The peripheral dramatic storylines about the characters’ relationships, however, are far less appetizing.

Audience reviewers had mixed reactions; but many said the scientific ideas transcended the dramatic flaws. There could have been a lot more science; more scientists shown explaining things, maybe even more charts and graphs showing what was happening to the world and why.

Movies and TV that appeal to the intellect can work. And it’s especially important for scientists to appeal to people’s reason, not their emotions. During covid, one reason the public health message in the U.S. did such a terrible job saving lives was it relied on emotional manipulation: fear and guilt. People didn’t get enough science; about how the virus works, how it’s transmitted, how scientists are investigating its origin, and dozens of other questions about which there was tremendous curiosity.

We have a chance to learn from some of those mistakes with global warming. When it comes to our climate, we still have the power over the outcome, Mann reminds me: “It still depends on us.”

Maybe if Hollywood makes movies with less preaching and more teaching, there’s still time to avoid making things too much worse.

“Apple is no longer participating in the Upper Burdekin project. Apple will continue to explore renewable energy projects in Australia,"" a spokesperson told Windpower Monthly.

A Windlab spokesperson said: “Windlab and Apple have agreed to terminate a power purchase agreement for the Upper Burdekin wind farm. The development phase of the project has taken significantly longer than originally anticipated, and the project no longer meets the PPA’s milestone requirements.”

Windlab owns 100% of the planned 500MW Upper Burdekin Upper Burdekin (500MW) Onshore Townsville, Queensland, Australia, Asia-Pacific Click to see full details wind farm.

The allocated site for the wind farm is north of Townsville, inland of Queensland’s Pacific coast.

The approximately A$1 billion (US$675 million) project has faced a backlash for its potential impact on wildlife after Windlab published the environmental report into its proposals. The report suggested local ecology – including endangered species like koalas – faced habitat loss and possibly even death as a result of vegetation removal associated with the wind farm.

Rainforest Reserves Australia is an environmental group campaigning against the wind farm. The group today (5 April) called on Windlab and its majority owner Andrew Forrest – colloquially known as “Twiggy” – to cancel the project following Apple’s withdrawal.

“Now is the time for Twiggy Forrest and Windlab to discard the Upper Burdekin wind farm plan. We know Australia is a world leader in extinctions, so carrying on with this project is madness,” Steven Nowakowski, a state conservationist with Rainforest Reserves Australia, said.

Windlab said it had taken numerous measures to protect ecology as part of the development process.

""Any suggestion that we will not apply the highest of standards to protect koalas and other species – is incorrect.

In Apple TV+’s new show, “Extrapolations,” the creators give us a series of stories all intertwined by the could be the effects of climate change should existing trends continue. The stories are all interwoven and they are about love, work, faith and family. As the planet changes because of the chaotic effects of climate change, the characters must face the battle between courage and complacency — after all, the fight for the future is universal.

“These are our extrapolations of potential futures. What we are trying to make a show about is, yes and? Yes, there is climate change, and? What do we collectively do about it? We can’t know the future, but can influence the present,” said Dorothy Fortenberry, one of the show’s executive producers.

“We hope the audience gets an understanding of the issues. They are entertained, they are stimulated. It is a look at our future, but really, it is looking at our present. They show is an act of faith and love,” executive producer Michael Ellenberg said.

Imagine having to walk around with an oxygen aid because the Earth’s air has become unbreathable. Imagine living in a world where entire species of animals have gone extinct because of climate change. These are all plausible scenarios “Extrapolations” explores as human do little to nothing in the fight to reverse course when fighting climate change.

In our current reality, how hopeful is the cast that we as humans will resolve the issues the show explores?

Heather Graham says she is hopeful we will find solutions for them in real life.

“How can we know? We can’t know. But actually, if we stimulate that question to an audience, then hopefully they will start to make change, and maybe we will,” said Indira Varma, who also stars in the show.

Daveed Diggs, who plays Rabbi Marshall Zucker, was a bit more cynical.

“It is going to have to be money involved. It is going to have to be profitable to do so. We are good, particularly in America, at making things profitable when we want to. I really do think that if we can figure out a way to monetize this, and once you can get rich off of it, you can make change happen,” he said.

For the show creators, how important was it to have a storyline of a faith leader and how did they connect it to climate change?

“These questions of climate change are questions of relationship. How do we relate to each other? How do we relate to God? How does climate change impact that relationship with God? If you believe God made the world, what is like to watch all the changes unfold and how does living within a religious or spiritual context influence the choices that you can make as a person of faith toward the planet itself,” Fortenberry said.

At the end of the first episode, for instance (there are spoilers throughout this review, by the way), a self-interested developer looking to profit off Arctic warming, played by Matthew Rhys, is literally killed by a walrus. Incredibly, this is portrayed somberly, as an overwrought metaphor for Earth and nature taking revenge, and that made me, frankly, lose it. I cracked up, too, when I realized that decorated thespian Meryl Streep’s main role in the show is voicing—wait for it—a whale. Given the show’s realistically grim portrayal of our climate future, something I write about every day and deeply care about people understanding, I wasn’t expecting to laugh so much.

Extrapolations, which hops forward sometimes decades in time with each episode to portray the worsening impacts of climate change, is infused with a strange kind of self-righteous exposition about the climate crisis, full of lines like “The world made you sick, because we made the world sick” and “They say there will be three meters of sea level rise by the end of the century.” Creator Scott Z. Burns, who also wrote 2011’s prescient Contagion and produced 2006’s An Inconvenient Truth, told the New York Times that he consulted with Elizabeth Kolbert and Bill McKibben for this effort. Burns, however, dropped the ball here on making a show that both informs and entertains. The climate science portrayed in Extrapolations is realistic, sure, but what isn’t is how these characters talk.

Many of Extrapolations’s characters vacillate wildly between two extremes, acting as either somber mouthpieces for climate alarm or cartoonish villains profiting off the crisis. They are also, overwhelmingly, very wealthy or upper-middle-class, as well as politically connected (the daughter of a rich developer taking advantage of sea level rise in Miami; a negotiator at a UN climate meeting; a brilliant scientist opposed to geoengineering who also happens to own a private yacht and has connections within the U.S. government). It takes five whole episodes for Extrapolations to actually focus on someone living in the Global South, which feels like a pretty glaring oversight for a show that purports to base itself in climate reality. (Another moment that made me laugh: Sienna Miller’s scientist shows up to work in her lab in what looks like an incredibly expensive linen outfit, with flowing wide-legged crop pants, elegant ballet flats, and an off-the-shoulder white top. I don’t know of any scientists who actually go to work in ‘fits like that, let alone have the cash to blow on Eileen Fisher-focused wardrobes, but maybe shit is different in the future.)

At the end of the day, Extrapolations never manages to feel like it’s about people, or the planet, even—the vibe is so constantly moralizing it’s impossible to forget we’re watching a TV Show Where We’re Supposed To Learn And Pay Attention. I had the same issue with the 2021 blockbuster Netflix movie Don’t Look Up, which at least recognized the inherent comedy in our world careening toward disaster while the powers that be do absolutely nothing to stop it. When I think about my favorite TV shows and movies that handle or mention climate change, they do the opposite: the story is centered on the characters first, issues second.

Take First Reformed, which effectively conveys the despair that a lot of us feel at this current moment about the fate of our planet. Or Beasts of the Southern Wild, which quietly amplifies the dangerous beauty of a changing world. WALL-E—yes, it’s a climate change movie—creates a love story for the ages from humanity’s (literal) trash. If you want media about the futuristic excesses of capitalism, Sorry To Bother You takes the viewer on a wild rollercoaster ride through a world where billionaires are truly let off the leash; meanwhile, Children of Men, which is set in 2027—uncomfortably close to the present—is a harrowing look at an apocalyptic near-future through one man’s journey to protect an expectant mother. And UK miniseries Years and Years, which aired in 2019 and portrays one family’s journey through 15 years of life-changing (and uncomfortably familiar) future events, manages to succeed where Extrapolations struggles: by making you care about the characters and their little dramas, even as the world is shifting around them.



All of these movies and shows focus not on the lives of politicians, billionaires, or wealthy scientists spewing facts like they’re the human embodiment of an action campaign, but rather normal people (or robots) attempting to navigate the new environment they find themselves in—not resigned to the fate of the world, exactly, but making the best of what’s in front of them. The kick in the guts for us, the viewer, comes from recognizing exactly how different that world looks from ours and how close we could be coming to making it into a reality.

There are moments in Extrapolations that work well and show the missed opportunity of this star-studded affair. I really liked a scene in the third episode where an arguing family has to put on their rain boots before going to their flooded synagogue, perhaps because it was blessedly free of overwrought exposition about science. I also don’t think it’s an accident that the fifth episode, which follows a man hired to drive mysterious cargo through a smog-choked future Mumbai, is one of the best of the show. The series gets a little better toward the end, and some of the scenarios it portrays are interesting. But it never quite recovers from the initial preachiness—or that dang walrus attack.",Apple TV+'s Extrapolations Is a Missed Opportunity

Tesla has released a video showing its $100 million 240 MWh California Flats Megapack battery, which is one of the largest installations in the United States of Tesla's Megapack product.

These Tesla Megapacks were purchased by Apple, and the Energy from them is used to help power the company's corporate headquarters in Cupertino.

I see many more businesses purchasing a setup like this in order to have a large supply of backup power in the event that the power goes out and operations of the business can continue.

In Monterey, California, there is a 2,900 acre Flats solar facility that features a wide range of solar technologies. These range from early solar panels to the most recent innovations and comprise 280 MW of solar panels, and they can power up to 100,000 homes a year.

This reduces annual CO2 emissions by 109,000 metric tons, which is like taking 22,000 gas cars off of the road. To store excess solar Energy generated, Arevon installed a 240 MW making it one of the largest battery installations using the Tesla Megapack.

Tesla Megapack provides reliable energy when demands are high or when the power has gone out, or the grid is down. This also reduces fossil fuel usage and moves humanity forward to sustainable energy.

Tesla Megapack Orders Are 2 Years Out

Tesla Megapack orders are back up to about early 2025, which is a 2-year backlog. There is a reason that Tesla still has a 2-year backlog for this product. There is no perfect solution for management of energy outside a Megapack solution that doesn't involve some kind of gas or fossil fuel generator.

It's good to see Apple and Tesla working together. Tesla Megapack and its Powerwall equivalent product have barely started to scratch the surface of all the energy needs they need to handle.

Elon Musk has said many times that the Energy Business of Tesla will eventually surpass the auto business in revenue. That may be hard to see today, but look forward 10 years and the growth rate of energy will catch up.

The installation of Megapack is pretty easy and when it ships, it ships fully assembled and ready to operate. This makes for a quick installation on site and reduces the complexity of getting it up and running. There is also a 20-year warranty on the product in case anything goes wrong.

What do you think about this deal between Apple and Tesla? Is it a good idea for Apple to use Tesla Megapack?

Srinagar, Mar 27: Farmers in Kashmir valley are worried about the early blooming of apple trees, which is an unusual phenomenon that experts attribute to global warming and fluctuating temperatures. Despite intermittent rainfall, the rising temperatures in March have concerned orchardists and environmentalists in the valley.

According to Dr. Tariq Rasool, Associate Professor of Plant Pathology at SKUAST-K, proper temperatures are required for fertilization or pollination. When temperatures decrease or it rains, it affects pollination and flowering. Last year, Kashmir witnessed a dry and hot March, and this year the bloom has come out very early. Dr. Tariq stated that there is no normal weather in Kashmir due to climate change and fluctuating temperatures over the past several years.

Dr. Tariq suggests that the government and SKUAST-K should issue weather-based advisories and decision support systems for the management of diseases, pests, and all agricultural and nutrient management. The climate change and fluctuating temperatures will have a definite impact on the horticulture industry. Generally, crop failures happen in Kashmir orchards due to bad or adverse weather conditions. When there is bloom and all of a sudden there is a decrease in temperature and rains occur, there are chances of crop failure.

Abdul Quds Beigh, Horticulture Development Officer of the Horticulture Department Kashmir, said that the early blooming of flowers has left farmers and apple growers concerned. He suggested that farmers change the spray schedule according to the dip in temperature and the stage of growth in their orchards. When the temperature dips, there would be less pollination in apple trees.

Director of the Indian Meteorological Centre Kashmir, Sonam Lotus, stated that this year has been warmer and witnessed a rise in temperature as compared to previous years, especially in February and March. He attributed the reason for the warm winter to less frequency of western disturbances, adding that the temperature is fluctuating. In previous years, J&K would witness good snow in February and March, but this year that did not happen. This year, the valley is witnessing an early spring.","Amid climate change concerns, early bloom of apple trees worries farmers"

Across two long days, unlikely allies will transport a secret package that many other interested parties are gunning for.

Extrapolations is essentially an omnibus series about the future, as seen through the eyes of people affected by climate change. That means every episode bears a distinct identity. In this week’s installment, entitled “2059 Part II: Nightbirds,” the creative team hits upon something partly neo-realist, partly Bourne-inspired action and party speculative fiction. It’s the most consistent and engrossing episode of the very patchy show so far.

Extrapolations recap: ‘2059 Part II: Nightbirds’

Season 1, episodes 5: We’ve seen Gaurav (played by Adarsh Gourav) before. He was on the street when the private security fleet owned by Nicholas Bilton (Kit Harington) blew up the plane of would-be environmental terrorist Gita (Indira Varma). She had threatened to release calcium carbonate all over the world, forcing the hands of millions to combat climate change.

Gaurav had no idea about any of that, of course. He’s a small-time hood in Mumbai. He’s on a job now, and he’s been paired with the foul-mouthed, short-tempered, sarcastic Neel (Gaz Choudhry), who immediately proves a thorn in Gaurav’s side. They have to get to Varanasi, which is 12 hours by truck, so they need to leave now.

Neel’s nursing a breakup. His girlfriend left him after he lost his leg, and he wants to talk about it, along with everything else in his life. Gaurav usually works alone and does not want to talk. Mumbai is a dangerous place to live, even if you don’t factor in Gaurav’s criminal side hustles. The air isn’t breathable, and everyone has to fight for hits of oxygen on the street. Birds can’t fly during the day anymore, so they crash into cars a lot more often.

Gaurav turned to crime when his family’s farm collapsed and his father killed himself. He doesn’t have a lot of hope for the future. Neel does, though, and he tries desperately to get his new companion to get some.

And the contraband cargo is …

They don’t get too far before the police shake them down, beating them pretty badly, but they’ve got a pretty good cover story for the stolen goods in the back. Unfortunately, the cops don’t want to hear it. Somehow, Neel manages to get the drop on the police and shoot his way out.

They make it to the first checkpoint, then trade cars and pick up a new passenger, a genetic scientist (played by Waris Ahluwalia, always a welcome sight) who was hit by a burst of radiation sickness. Now he’s only lucid a few minutes a day. They also learn what kind of contraband they’re carrying: seeds. The trouble is, someone else (Keri Russell) is looking for them. And she doesn’t seem like she’ll be as careless as the corrupt cops.

Neel makes a foolhardy decision to help a little boy (Dhruv Jagan Badireddy) in danger of dying from intense sun poisoning — and almost dies for his altruism. The boy’s family takes in the three travelers for the night. That’s when Ms. Someone Else shows up and a bloody gunfight ensues. The seeds are safe … at great cost. The question is, will it have been worth it?

Solid directing and writing trump a preachy cli-fi message

I didn’t know the name Richie Mehta before it showed up under the “directed by” credit in this week’s episode of Extrapolations, and that made for a pleasant surprise. Mehta’s been making what sound like dependable, solid movies in a number of genres for the last two decades. And I think his not having the ego of some other directors means that he really just tells this story with as little nonsense as possible.

Prolific playwright Rajiv Joseph scripts this week’s episode. And though he occasionally reaches for theatrical devices and over-enunciates his themes, compared to the previous entries in this series, he might as well be Samuel Beckett. Together, the two men make something that just flies to its violent outcome.

The touchstones were likely not simply show creator Scott Z. Burns’ Bourne movie script, but that’s basically the territory we’re in, with a little neo-neo-realism thrown in. (It gets nowhere near as dark, but the idea of a nighttime odyssey into darkness and violence reminded of Brillante Mendoza’s Kinatay, a movie I’m sure at least nine other people have seen.)

All hail Keri Russell

The violence was quite effectively utilized as well. Keri Russell (who you might have seen in Felicity or The Americans) showing up and just laying waste to folks was quite unexpected. Extrapolations isn’t necessarily afraid of going dark, but there’s metaphorical bleakness (which could very easily have been the title of this show) and then there’s the sight of people bleeding to death in an impoverished village.

The key to this episode working while the others flail and drown is that it’s tangentially related to the show’s broader themes at best. Yes, Neel’s optimism is meant to be a kind of stand-in for the creators’ worldview (and spoiler alert: he isn’t rewarded for it). But the global climate change stuff this week acts merely as set dressing. The protagonists could have been hauling gold or radium or something. Doesn’t matter.

Admittedly, this dilutes the moral of the story. But I’ll take it over being hit in the head with the least-subtle version of “Hey people, we’re doomed! Do something!” like I am every other week by Extrapolations.

The first batch yielded 30,000 litres of vinegar and has helped to prevent 50 tonnes of apples from being wasted.

The Continente Seleção Apple of Alcobaça Cider Vinegar, produced from fresh apple juice, has also obtained IGP certification, the retailer noted.

Select apple varieties – including Casa Nova, Golden Delicious, Red Delicious, Royal Gala, Fuji, Granny Smith, Jonagold, Reineta and Pink – have been used in making the vinegar.

Continente challenged five apple producers from Alcobaça – a Portuguese city and municipality 100 kilometres north of Lisbon – to develop a product using small or deformed apples that are not commercially viable.

Ondina Afonso, president of the Continente Producers’ Club, added, “The project began through an initiative of the Continente Producers’ Club, the ‘Waste Fair’, aimed at producers, promoting the valuation of some products, such as those that the end customer does not value, nor wants to buy, such as fruit that is too small or with defects.”

The Project

Apple producers Narc Frutas, Cooperfrutas, Frutalvor, Campotec and Lusofruta collaborated with Continente’s industrial partner, Mendes Gonçalves, to create the product.

Jorge Soares, administrator of Campotec, added, “We already have a very old partnership with MC [Mendes Gonçalves], of supplying apples from Alcobaça, and this project arises from the communion of the work of several producers as a way of solving the problem of apples that would result in food waste.

“The Alcobaça Apple Vinegar is a way for us to help the planet by transforming these apples into a value-added product.”

Sustainability is clearly high on the agenda for CEO Tim Cook. Only yesterday (27 October) Apple announced record results for fiscal 2022 fourth quarter revenue of US$90.1bn – up 8% year on year. That put annual revenue at US$394.3bn, also up 8%.

“This quarter’s results reflect Apple’s commitment to our customers, to the pursuit of innovation, and to leaving the world better than we found it,” said Cook.

“As we head into the holiday season with our most powerful lineup ever, we are leading with our values in every action we take and every decision we make. We are deeply committed to protecting the environment, to securing user privacy, to strengthening accessibility, and to creating products and services that can unlock humanity’s full creative potential.”

Let's hope Cook has taken into account the fact that global CO2 emissions have more than doubled since Apple was founded in 1976, so leaving the world better than when they found it could be quite the task.

Apple will track and audit key manufacturing partners on carbon

The message seems consistent from Apple, and now they are putting the onus on their key suppliers to decarbonise. Apple requires reporting on Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions reductions related to Apple production.

Apple says it will track the progress of key partners as it aims to set the same standards in its supply chain – the company has been carbon neutral since 2020 and intends to meet the same standard across its entire supply chain.

“Fighting climate change remains one of Apple’s most urgent priorities, and moments like this put action to those words,” said Cook, Apple’s CEO. “We’re looking forward to continued partnership with our suppliers to make Apple’s supply chain carbon neutral by 2030. Climate action at Apple doesn’t stop at our doors, and in this work, we’re determined to be a ripple in the pond that creates a bigger change.”

That work Cook is referring to sees Apple investing in numerous projects around the world to create clean energy, and some smart updates to its products.

Apple has reduced its emissions by 40% since 2015, largely through adopting renewable energy. With more than 70% of direct manufacturing spend coming from more than 200 suppliers, it’s no surprise to hear they have also committed to clean energy solutions.

Major partners including Corning Incorporated, Nitto Denko Corporation, SK hynix, STMicroelectronics, TSMC, and Yuto have committed to 100% renewable energy for all production relating to Apple products.",Apple puts pressure on supply chain to decarbonise by 2030

Based in Cupertino, Calif., Apple is the largest tech company measured by revenues: $366 billion in 2021. It was founded in 1976 by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne.

Apple has connected the world through its electronics, and it also trying to better the planet through its sustainability efforts. As such, its goal is carbon neutrality by 2030 and to create products that are also net zero by the same time. Finally, it hopes to ensure its product supply chain only uses renewable electricity by 2030.

Furthermore, it only uses recycled and renewable materials in its products and packaging. It aims to eliminate plastics in its packaging by 2025 and reduce its water impact while making its products and operating its facilities. And it wants to eliminate waste sent to landfills from its corporate facilities and suppliers.

“Across all of these efforts, we never lose sight of our primary mission — working to address the climate crisis,” says Lisa Jackson, vice president of environment and policy for Apple. “It’s an urgent challenge no one company, entity, or individual can tackle alone, and this year, we’re addressing it with more ambition than ever before. In fact, we’ve begun to decouple business growth from emissions as we drive towards our goal of bringing our entire carbon footprint to be net zero by 2030 — including our supply chain and the use of our products.”

Jackson, whose comments appeared in the company’s sustainability statement and who previously served as EPA administrator in the Obama administration, said that Apple’s revenues grew by 33%. At the same time, its net emissions remained flat in 2021. She adds that 213 of its top suppliers are committed to using 100% green energy, and in the last year, Apple doubled its use of renewable power. Additionally, last year, 18% of the materials in Apple products came from recycled sources.

What is Apple doing to fight climate change?

Carbon neutrality is an aggressive goal, especially for a multinational company with operations all over the world. But Apple wants to achieve this by 2030. It also intends to reduce related emissions by 75% using a baseline of 2015. In 2021, it avoided more than 23 million metric tons of emissions and reduced its carbon footprint by 40%. This reduction comports with the goals set by the Paris agreement — to limit warming to 1.5°C.

It attributes this success to efforts and initiatives that had long been underway — things like sourcing all of its renewable electricity for its facilities and using low-carbon materials in products. In 2018, Apple set out to fuel all of its retail stores, offices, and data centers using green energy. In 2020, it expanded its efforts to include business travel and employee commute.

Here’s what else Apple is doing:

— designing products and manufacturing processes to be less carbon-intensive by increasing material and product energy efficiency.

— increasing energy efficiency at its facilities and supply chain by, in part, reducing energy use. This has avoided 0.06 million metric tons of CO2.

— using 100% renewable energy at its facilities. This has avoided 1 million metric tons of CO2.

— scaling up investments in nature-based solutions and restoring ecosystems worldwide.

“Since April 2020, we have been carbon neutral for our corporate emissions, including direct emissions (scope 1), electricity-related emissions (scope 2), as well as emissions from business travel and employee commute (scope 3), the company says. “To reach neutrality, we focused on driving energy efficiency improvements and transitioning our facilities to 100% renewable electricity, which we achieved in 2018. These programs have reduced our scope 1 and scope 2 emissions by 67 percent, even as our business grew.”

Tell us more about your recycling efforts.

The company makes dozens of products and ships tens of millions of products worldwide. Its strategy is to use low-carbon energy and recycled content. For example, by switching to recycled and low-carbon aluminum, its CO2 emissions tied to aluminum have fallen by 68% since 2015. The Ipad now uses 100% recycled aluminum in its enclosure. So does the Apple Watch.

In 2021, Apple released eight products with 20% or more recycled content. It also doubled its use of recycled tungsten, rare earth elements, and cobalt while using for the first time certified recycled gold.

It is using 75% fewer plastics in its packaging compared to 2015. However, the goal is to eliminate plastics in its packaging by 2025. Further, it will banish waste sent to landfill from its corporate offices, data centers, and retail stores.

“We aim to have our products be part of thriving, responsible, circular supply chains — where finite material extraction is replaced by continual recycling and reuse. We’re increasingly sourcing more of the materials we use from circular supply chains drawn from recycled content and renewable resources,” says the sustainability paper.

In the last year:

— 18% of product material came from recycled and renewable sources. “This milestone is part of our broader strategy focusing on 14 materials that account for more than 90 percent of the total product mass shipped to our customers.”

— plastics made up only 4% of packaging.

— 59% of the aluminum came from recycled sources.

— 13% of the cobalt in current products came from certified recycled sources, including end-of-life batteries.

— At least 100 facilities are ‘zero-waste’ while recycling and composting efforts diverted 68% of the company’s waste to landfills.

And water use?

Apple tracks water use at its corporate offices, retail stores, and data centers, which have water management systems. Data centers make up 30% of the company’s water use. It says its supply chain accounts for 99% of its water footprint.

It uses recycled water for irrigation, cooling systems, and toilet flushing. The recycled water comes primarily from municipal treatment plants; less than 5% comes from onsite treatment. It also captures rainwater.","Apple Is Tackling Climate Change by Using Renewables, Increasing Recycling, Limiting Waste"

We see raging fires, water shortages, and vanishing Arctic ice — these threats are real

Episode 1:

How much is the planet warming?

The landmark climate agreement struck in Paris does commit countries around the world to limit warming to “well below” 2 degrees Celsius. The world has already heated up by a little over 1 degree Celsius. And unfortunately, under current policies, the world is still on track to reach close to 3 degrees Celsius by 2100.

Can desalination save us from drought?

In the show, a billionaire shares patents to his desalination technology with drought-choked countries, seemingly to get them to agree to weaker climate goals.

There’s not much detail in the first episode about what makes his “state-of-the-art” desalination technology so special. Modern desalination techniques have been around for decades, which some parts of the world — particularly in the Middle East and Northern Africa — already rely on heavily. Israel, where much of the first episode takes place, desalinates around 70 percent of its municipal water supply.

But desalination is no silver bullet. To start, it’s expensive because it’s very energy-intensive. There are two main methods used: blasting the water with heat to evaporate it and then recondense it sans salt; or using immense pressure to push water through a reverse osmosis membrane to filter out the salt.

Desalination is no silver bullet

Not only do both of those processes require a lot of energy but also most desalination plants still run on fossil fuels. So making potable water this way, with today’s dirty energy system, also produces greenhouse gas emissions causing climate change. Even if renewable energy replaces fossil fuels, desalination has another pollution problem to solve in the form of leftover brine that becomes waste.

Episode 2:

Climate change is pushing vulnerable species to the brink. Can we de-extinct them?

This episode follows Sienna Miller as a researcher for a company that archives the genes of species on the brink of extinction. The goal is to one day “bring these creatures back.” It’s de-extinction, one of the most controversial ideas within conservation.

You might have heard about a biotech company attempting to bring a dodo-like creature and woolly mammoth-elephant mashup to life, for instance. These initiatives are big on hype and short on results. Even if they are successful, they won’t actually resurrect the same animals that went extinct. The technology they’re working with would create hybrids using the creatures’ distant relatives. Picture a furry elephant with a high-domed head.

Scientists The Verge has spoken with argue that there simply needs to be a lot more focus on preventing species from going extinct in the first place. Today, around a million animal and plant species face extinction, more than at any other time during human history.

Will people be able to talk to other animals?

My favorite character of the season is a humpback whale voiced by Meryl Streep. It communicates with Miller’s character through some kind of animal interpretation technology. This clearly falls within the realm of science fiction.

Scientists are studying whale songs to see if they can decode them

But scientists are studying whale songs to see if they can decode them. NPR’s podcast Invisibilia has a neat episode about an initiative using artificial intelligence to try to understand non-human communication. Other scientists are studying whether nonhuman animals can even communicate through something like language. Some of this research was inspired by TikTok sensation Bunny the dog, who seemingly presses buttons to ask for scritches.

Episode 3:

How much of Miami will be underwater in the future?

This episode is set in a soggy Miami in 2047, where rising sea levels threaten to wipe out a local synagogue. In reality, Miami is facing two or more feet of sea level rise by 2060 and around six feet by 2100. That’s an existential problem for Miami-Dade County. It only sits about six feet above the current sea level, on average, and more than 877,000 people live below that elevation.

Are seawalls the answer to sea level rise?

A main plot thread in this episode follows a synagogue applying for “preservation” by the state of Florida, which would involve determining how and where to build protective structures like seawalls. While seawalls might provide some shelter to communities at the greatest risk of flooding, they are only built to withstand so much abuse and can ultimately fail. The United Nations panel of climate experts recently warned that seawalls can promote a false sense of security and can potentially put more people in danger if populations continue to grow along low-lying coasts.

Seawalls are also controversial because they typically only protect a chosen set of properties or communities. As we see in the episode, what’s deemed worthy of protection is fraught with ethical questions — and maybe a healthy share of injustice and corruption as well. Moreover, shielding one part of a coastline can actually increase land loss for its neighbors. Seawalls deflect wave energy, which just makes it someone else’s problem.",The Verge

Juice, pulp and other waste from Empire apples, when injected into chicken eggs before hatching, show signs of boosting the animal’s intestinal health, according to Cornell research.

“Apples are one of the top fruits produced in the United States and we have long been aware of their health benefits,” said lead author Cydney Jackson, a doctoral student in the field of food science.

“In our study, we were able to see how an apple – specifically, the Empire apple developed at Cornell in the 1940s – improved the intestinal health of production broilers, and we observed signs for the overall good health of the bird,” Jackson said.

The researchers injected juice, pomace and pulp – in vivo – into the amniotic fluid of the developing embryo inside a chicken egg. After the eggs were hatched, relevant samples were collected for analyses.

The researchers found that introducing apple juice and pomace into the egg can increase the young chicken’s transport system for amino acids, improve the bioavailability of iron, boost the microbial populations in the animal’s large intestine and support the growth of potentially beneficial gut bacteria.

“Apples are comprised of bioactive constituents such as phytochemicals and prebiotics that could help intestinal health and the gut microbiome,” said senior author Elad Tako, associate professor of food science in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences (CALS) and a co-author of the paper.

Each year, the U.S. sees nearly $20 billion in apple sales, with an estimated 5 million tons of the fruit produced annually in the U.S. within the last decade, according to the paper.

For juice and apple production, about 33.4 million bushels of apples were used in 2021-22, according to the U.S. Apple Association. Nearly 175,350 metric tons of apple pomace – the fibrous waste – is produced annually and typically tossed away in landfills, according to the paper. This damages the environment, as it disrupts the carbon-nitrogen ratio of soil due to the pomace’s sugar content.

“Pomace is treated like industrial waste now. If we can potentially use the pomace, which is rich in nutrients, we can add it to the diet of broilers,” Tako said. “We can improve the nutrition in their feed and achieve productivity in a more natural way – and potentially reduce the use of added dietary chemicals.”

The researchers said this was an initial study to demonstrate the potential effect for adding apple waste to chicken feed and they indicated a need for long-term studies.

Said Tako: “Potentially, we’ll be upscaling industrial waste that is currently being discarded. That’s sustainable.”

In addition to Jackson and Tako, the co-authors of “Empire Apple (Malus domestica) Juice, Pomace, and Pulp Modulate Intestinal Functionality, Morphology, and Bacterial Populations In Vivo (Gallus gallus)” are Cornell doctoral students Viral Shukla, Nikolai Kolba and Nikita Agarwal; and Olga I. Padilla-Zakour, professor of food science.

Apple has finally activated the humidity and temperature sensor in the HomePod Mini.

Earlier this month, Apple announced the second generation of its full-size HomePod. One of the new features was a sensor for detecting a room’s current temperature and humidity.

Back in 2021, the teardown specialists at iFixit disassembled the HomePod Mini. iFixit discovered a Texas Instruments HDC2010 humidity and temperature sensor that Apple failed to mention.

“The placement is interesting, because, rather than clustered with heat-generating circuitry, it’s about as far as it could be from that hardware,” wrote iFixit.

“This, along with the carefully-placed hole in the exterior shell that it occupies, makes us think this sensor is meant to measure conditions outside the HomePod mini, rather than inside.”

Apple released the HomePod 16.3 firmware this week that, almost two years later, proved iFixit’s assumption correct. When paired with iOS 16.3, the HomePod Mini can now use its sensor to report a room’s current temperature and humidity.

To access the information:

Open the Home app on your iPhone or iPad. Select the room in which the HomePod is located, or tap ‘Climate’ at the top of the main screen for your home. You should now see Temperature and Humidity information at the top of the screen. If you have multiple sensors in a room, the average will be displayed.

Automations can be created based on the information from a HomePod’s sensor. If it’s too cold, you could automatically switch on a heater. Alternatively, if it’s too hot, an air-con system could be activated.

Apple is also reportedly gearing up to re-release its new HomeKit architecture after pulling it in December:

In December, users reported devices becoming unresponsive or failing to update fully after upgrading to the new HomeKit. Hopefully, Apple has now fixed whatever was causing the problems.

Apple's aggressive iPhone updater cycle has us now conditioned to expect better and faster, but the iPhone 14 launch might change all that.

A couple of things lead to this conclusion.

First, back in March, Apple-watcher Ming-Chi Kuo reported that only the 6.1-inch ‌iPhone 14 Pro‌ and the 6.7-inch ‌iPhone 14 Pro‌ Max would be getting the new A16 chip and that 6.1-inch ‌iPhone 14‌ and the 6.7-inch iPhone 14‌ Max will stick with the A15 chip found in the iPhone 13 line up.

Now this tells us something interesting: The iPhone is no longer limited by processor speed since Apple can bundle the older chip into newer handsets without compromising the experience.

Kuo also mentioned at the same time that all four iPhone 14 handsets would get a RAM bump to 6GB (up from 4GB) and that the Pro and Pro Max versions would also get a RAM upgrade from the existing LPDDR4X to LPDDR5.

And now DigiTimes Asiaseems to corroborate this, claiming that Samsung Electronics, SK Hynix, and Micron Technology are all expecting to see increased sales of LPDDR5 RAM.

So, what will LPDDR5 bring to the iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max?

Well, along with increased performance thanks to increased speed (6400 Mbps vs. 4266 Mbps) and an increased performance thanks to a doubling of the bank density (a maximum of 16 banks vs. 8 banks) compared to LPDDR4X, another massive benefit is better power efficiency because LPDDR5 operates at 1.1V compared to 1.2V for LPDDR4X.

iPhone RAM isn't something that Apple talks about during launches, so either Apple is going to make a big deal of this change, or it's going to be a silent change that Apple is implementing to give the iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max handsets a bigger performance and battery edge over the lower-specification models.",Why would Apple recycle old chips in the new iPhone?

More and more smartphone OEMs are adopting the circular approach. Apple and Samsung stand out as leaders in sustainable initiatives.

Each of the top OEMs performs differently across the three major stages of the smartphone circular economy – production, usage and end of life.

OEM tie-ups with local sustainability partners have increased, leading to circular initiatives across geographies. But OEM initiatives fall short when compared to the volumes of new smartphones being shipped every year.

London, Jakarta, Hong Kong, Boston, Toronto, New Delhi, Beijing, Taipei, Seoul – December 27, 2022

Apple leads the smartphone space in the overall approach towards sustainability, according to Counterpoint Research’s latest “Smartphones and Circular Economy: Creating a Sustainable Future” report. This report assesses how well the OEM is reducing its impact on the environment by reusing materials, recycling devices, and minimizing waste at each stage, from the design of the smartphone, processing chips, and packaging to power consumption. The report also encompasses corporate-level initiatives, progress on carbon neutrality, and SDG 13 (one of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals adopted by the United Nations).

The Smartphone Circular Economy Report Scorecard includes a robust metric system that evaluates the top five smartphone OEMs globally. Each OEM has its own vision and overall approach toward sustainability. Apple’s vision seems to be clearer than its competition and its actions support the said vision.

Apple on Top in Sustainability Vision Rankings Compared to Immediate Competition

While sustainability vision is just the start, each of these OEMs has performed quite differently across the three major stages of the smartphone circular economy:

Production

Usage

End of Life

Production

Production of a smartphone is responsible for about 80% of the total carbon footprint in its life cycle, and hence it is the most vital of the stages. OEMs have concentrated on and advertised this aspect the most. Newly sourced materials are being replaced with eco-friendly components, while biodegradable and eco-friendly packaging is the norm now. Even water-saving mechanisms are being adhered to in the entire manufacturing ecosystem. OEMs are now expecting their vendors to adhere to environmental norms as well. Top brands like Samsung, Apple, and OPPO have started propagating environmental benefits through their initiatives in production. The details, however, are more complex than what is being advertised. While the initiatives are a big step in the right direction, revenue and profit remain the apex objectives.

Usage

Most consumer durable brands inherently work towards motivating consumers to replace their devices with newer, more technologically enhanced versions. But due to sustainability efforts, OEMs have to maintain a balance between enticing the consumer and saving the environment. Chinese leaders like OPPO, Xiaomi, and, vivo are consistently trying to improve battery life and energy efficiency.

While Apple scores high on overall longevity, updates, and innovations toward sustainability, Samsung scores higher in repair, energy efficiency and after-sales networks. In the end, it depends on how long a consumer chooses to use a device. Any steps taken by OEMs to support this endeavor matter most.

End of Life

OEMs have a lot to do when it comes to reclaiming their smartphones once their useable life comes to an end. Getting pre-owned smartphones back into the system is necessary to handle them sustainably. They need to be repaired/refurbished for reuse or recycled responsibly to complete the circular loop. The main objective here is to reduce e-waste. It is vital to know how much OEMs are doing for this cause.

The global refurbished market has grown by leaps and bounds in the last few years. In 2021, the market grew 15% YoY and shows promise to grow further in the coming years. Carriers and retail refurbishment players are growing but OEM initiatives on reclamation, refurbishment, and e-waste reduction are quite limited. Even the best brands are not active enough in pulling back their used stock. The highest potential now rests with initiatives like trade-ins, which ensure a buyback of the older devices. This takes volumes of landfills. Brands like OPPO, vivo and Xiaomi have a long way to go with reclaiming and refurbishing devices if we consider the volume of new smartphones shipped by them every year. Apple and Samsung lead here as well but most of the reclaiming and refurbishing is done by the other players in the secondary ecosystem. The end-of-life stage is quite complex but one of the most rewarding if done right.

OEM tie-ups with local sustainability partners have increased, leading to circular initiatives across geographies. But such initiatives need to grow at a faster rate to be in consonant with the volumes of new smartphones being shipped every year. There are opportunities as well. Sustainability and its different aspects, initiatives and players can be broken down into many sectors with varying opportunities. The benefits for the environment compound when the industry and government take steps in the right direction.

OEMs already have a name for themselves, but their sustainability initiatives will either make or break their perception in the years to come.

The net-zero emissions plans of 24 multinational companies are not only largely misleading, but also distract from a failure to cut climate-wrecking emissions in line with the Paris climate goals.

The latest Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor , which is authored by German think tank, the New Climate Institute, paints a picture of private sector obfuscation in regard to meaningful decarbonization.

The report found the climate strategies of 15 of the 24 companies surveyed were of ""low"" or ""very low integrity"" due to inadequate or ambiguous pledges.

Nearly all of the corporations have committed to becoming net-zero or carbon neutral in the next three decades. Net-zero can only be reached after a 90% minimum emissions cut, say the report's authors.

Yet on average, the companies will only reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by about 36%, which is ""wholly insufficient"" to limit temperature rise to 1.5 Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit), said the report.

Just five of the 24 companies — H&M Group, Holcim, Stellantis, Maersk, and Thyssenkrupp — commit to decarbonize their emissions by at least around 90% by their respective net-zero target years.

Claiming carbon neutrality while doing business as usual

Promises of climate neutrality by half of the corporations analyzed – including tech companies Apple, Google and Microsoft, and German postal delivery service Deutsche Post DHL — are highly misleading in that they only refer to 3% of total emissions.

""Quite shockingly,"" the largest share of the companies' own emissions are left out, noted Thomas Day, an analyst at the New Climate Institute and report co-author.

He said the terminology of net zero ""should really mean deep decarbonization to not mislead investors and consumers.""

Only three corporations — shipping company Maersk, and telecommunications firms Vodafone and Deutsche Telekom — commit to deep decarbonization across all their emissions up and down the value chain.

Mercedes-Benz' climate pledges were rated as having ""low"" integrity Image: AP

""This creates a really difficult situation for the handful of companies that are genuinely ambitious and are taking part in the process with more honesty and integrity, because it's impossible for them to distinguish themselves from companies who are greenwashing,"" said Day.

The inadequacy of the pledges is compounded by the fact that two-thirds of the companies plan to rely on offsetting emissions through carbon credits – rather than cutting emissions at the source.

The companies, which are all members of the UN initiative, Race to Zero — whose membership has tripled to nearly 9,000 companies since January 2022, noted the report — commonly use forests and other biological carbon reservoirs to offset their emissions.

However, the report noted that such offsets might be unable to neutralize GHG emissions in the long term if destroyed by forest fires, for example.

Furthermore, two to four planets would be required if all companies were to plan CO2 compensation strategies on a similar scale.

2030 targets won't be met

The inadequacy but also the ambiguity of the longer term net-zero corporate targets is masking the even bigger failure to make immediate emissions cuts in line with 2030 targets, said the authors.

To achieve carbon neutrality by mid-century, the report estimates that companies need to cut emissions 43% by 2030 from 2019 levels.

""On average, these 24 companies commit only 15% emissions reductions by 2030,"" noted Thomas Day. ""So it's much closer to business as usual than it is to where we need to be going.""

Companies are responding to calls from consumers, shareholders and regulators to decarbonize by setting goals and demonstrating their climate leadership.

""[But] the fragmentation of approaches and the general lack of regulation or oversight, means that it is more difficult than ever to distinguish between real climate leadership and unsubstantiated greenwashing,"" according to the report.

Moreover, the ambiguity of these net zero targets is ""actually distracting from the grave insufficiency of short-term targets,"" said Day.

Since the publication of the first Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor a year ago, there has been little progress in general, said the authors.

Only one company with 'adequate' pledges

Of the companies surveyed, German steel giant Thyssen Krupp's climate strategy was rated to have ""moderate"" integrity, but those of Deutsche Post DHL, Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz all had ""low"" integrity.

As in the 2022 edition of the report, Danish multinational Maersk is the only company whose climate strategy had ""adequate"" integrity, in part through investment in alternative fuels.

One of the report's key findings is that intense scrutiny and transparency is vital for ensuring that pledges and claims are credible. Companies must be held accountable if they are not.

This should be the job of regulators who cannot rely on public and shareholder pressure to keep corporations in line with climate targets, said Thomas Day.

""Regulators, international standard setters and companies need to focus with great determination on the integrity of companies' emissions reduction plans up to 2030,"" he said.

""Current corporate plans in no way reflect the urgency for immediate drastic emissions cuts.""

An article describing the research is published in the journal Biomass Conversion and Biorefinery. The key concept is that of the circular economy, a system of closed loops designed to reduce costs, recover resources from waste, promote reuse and recycling, and maximize use of bioenergy and biomaterials.

Apples are among the most widely consumed fruits worldwide, both fresh and processed as juice, vinegar and cider, among other products. The apple processing industry throws away much of the fruit as waste.

According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), global apple production totaled almost 86.5 metric tons in 2020. The main producers were China (46.85%), the United States (5.38%) and Turkey (4.97%).

“Biorefining with dry anaerobic digestion produces electricity and thermal energy, reduces greenhouse gas emissions, and valorizes waste via conversion to organic fertilizer,” said Tânia Forster Carneiro, last author of the article. Carneiro earned a PhD in industrial process engineering from the University of Cadiz in Spain in 2004 and is currently a lecturer in bioengineering and biotechnology at UNICAMP’s School of Food Engineering (FEA).

Anaerobic digestion, she explained, is a microbiological process involving consumption of nutrients and production of methane. Dry anaerobic digestion, with total solids in the reactor exceeding 15%, is considered an efficient method of recycling solid organic waste and far more environmentally appropriate than landfill disposal.

The results pointed to a yield of 36.61 liters of methane per kilogram (kg) of removed solids, potentially generating 1.92 kilowatt hours (kWh) of electricity and 8.63 megajoules (MJ) of heat per ton of apple pomace.

The bioenergy thus recovered could supply 19.18% of the electricity and 11.15% of the heat used to operate the anaerobic biorefining reactor designed by the researchers, who conclude that biofuels and bioelectricity can contribute to public policy, reduce fossil fuel consumption and cut the greenhouse gas emissions from organic residues.

Energy transition

The research group found the greenhouse gas emissions avoided by the biogas corresponded to 0.14 kg of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO 2 e) in the electricity and 0.48 kg of CO 2 e in the heat generated per ton of apple pomace.

“Anaerobic digestion is a stable technology and can be implemented in small to medium plants, assisting the circular economy transition and offering an added-value alternative to disposal of fruit residues as waste that benefits the entire supply chain,” Carneiro said.

The other authors of the article are Larissa Castro Ampese, William Gustavo Sganzerla and Henrique Di Domenico Ziero, PhD candidates at FEA-UNICAMP; Josiel Martins Costa, currently a postdoctoral fellow at FEA-UNICAMP; and Gilberto Martins, a professor at UFABC’s School of Engineering, Modeling and Applied Social Sciences.

The research is supported by FAPESP via three projects (18/14938-4, 19/26925-7 and 21/03950-6).

Carneiro and Sganzerla recently published an article on anaerobic digestion to produce methane from malting barley bagasse in the beer industry, detailing the gains in electricity and heat in terms of the balance of mass and energy in all inbound and outbound flows. The article shows that it is possible to produce 0.23 megawatt-hours of electricity for every metric ton of barley bagasse processed (read more at: agencia.fapesp.br/39093).

While it did not specify the volume to be procured from the project, Apple said that the contracted power is equal to the electricity consumption of 80,000 homes per year. For comparison, Windlab estimates that its 100-turbine project can produce electricity for up to 300,000 Australian homes.

Apple is already carbon neutral across its global operations and aims to achieve the same across its entire business and manufacturing supply chain and products by 2030.

Windlab, owned by Squadron Energy and Federation Asset Management, intends to build the Upper Burdekin wind park on pastoral land in Queensland’s Badhun county. Last month, the developer sealed an indigenous land use agreement with the traditional owners of the selected site.

Upper Burdekin is the second project contracted by Apple to address the electricity customers use to charge their Apple devices and follows a deal for a 300-MW solar project in Texas.

However, a new leak from inside Apple has revealed that while the new iPhone will use USB-C, it will require a specialised MFi cable for proper operation, raising questions about Apple's compatibility and charging standards. Why has Apple hated the inclusion of USB-C as a standard, what has the new leak suggested, and could Apple get away with such a plan?

Why has Apple hated the inclusion of USB-C as a standard?

When it comes to USB cables, it is almost universally agreed that USB-C is by far one of the best. To start, USB-C entirely eliminates the USB superposition phenomenon whereby it takes three attempts to insert a USB connector (thanks to its ability to be inserted in any orientation). Secondly, USB-C connectors have multiple channels and can support USB 3.0 speeds (expected to exceed 40Gbps), and thirdly, USB-C connectors can support much higher charging currents. But above all else, it seems that USB-C will likely become the universal connector for all devices, and this will massively help reduce e-waste while only requiring users to have one cable type for data and charging.

As the rest of the industry rapidly moves towards USB-C, Apple has been notably resistant to its use. Sure, the latest iPad utilises a USB-C connector, and several of their MacBooks use USB-C as well, but Apple still produces consumer devices with their own proprietary connectors. But recently, the EU introduced new legislation requiring all consumer charging devices to use USB-C, and Apple was not happy with this decision.

According to Apple, forcing manufacturers to use USB-C stifles innovation, takes away design freedom, and hurts the overall capabilities of engineers. Now, while this argument may seem reasonable (as governments telling engineers how to do their job never ends well), it is more likely that Apple doesn’t want to use USB-C so it can retain control over its proprietary technologies, squeezing out money from anyone who wants to create compatible products.

It should be noted that the solutions that Apple have produced are exceptionally good; the lightning cable is also double-sided and can be inserted in any orientation like USB-C. However, as only Apple devices use the lightning port, it is very difficult for customers to use generic off-the-shelf cables with them. This is notably seen in cheap charging cables that often cannot provide quick charging or data capabilities. Thus, users are often forced to buy Apple cables that conform to their Made For iPad/iPhone (MFi) certification, which are extraordinarily expensive.









A new leak suggests Apple will circumvent USB-C requirements

Recently, a well-known leaker called ShrimpApplePro has released internal Apple information regarding the next generation of USB-C devices and how Apple will bend the rules to force users to purchase expensive cables. Despite the EU specifically stating that new USB-C devices need to support fast charging regardless of the cable used, Apple may only provide the bare minimum capabilities over standard USB-C cables while providing full capabilities when using Apple MFi-certified cables.

Whether the source of this information can be trusted is up for debate. However, the aforementioned user was correct with their leak on the Dynamic Island and the iPhone 14 RAM increase. Considering Apple’s history with custom cables, pricing practices, and resistance against right-to-repair, restricting capabilities over non-MFi cables would not come as a surprise. It should also be noted that other manufacturers routinely use their own cable standards, meaning Apple would not be alone in such a move.

Could Apple get away with this move?

According to the leaker, Apple will enforce this requirement via software to detect what type of cable is being used and effectively penalise those who opt for a third-party cable. Some online users have pointed out that if this software limitation is incorporated into Apple products, then it would violate EU law, citing that the purpose of forcing USB-C will prevent manufacturers from unfairly limiting charging speeds and data rates. However, it appears that the legislation states that it will “help prevent” as opposed to outlaw, meaning it could be perfectly legal.

With all things considered, if Apple does indeed go through with this plan, nothing will likely be done for a few years before the EU files a lawsuit. This will undoubtedly result in a fine, which Apple will fight to reduce and eventually pay after massive profits have been made. But, just like BatteryGate, Apple’s image could be tarnished by such a move, especially considering that the world is becoming more environmentally conscious.

All of this is speculation, and just because someone with credibility has supposedly leaked information internal to Apple doesn’t make any of this true. It is possible that one engineer internally to Apple mentioned how this could be done but never got passed the drawing board. It could also be disgruntled environmentalists looking to harm a successful business simply because they disagree with Apple’s repair policy.",Apple vs EU: The Battle Over USB-C Standards & E-Waste Reduction

Customers can use their own implements and tools to complete their repairs or rent custom-made toolkits for £54.90 for a week, as part of efforts to keep mobiles and computers in use for longer.

Jeff Williams, Apple’s chief operating officer, said: “We believe the best technology for our customers and for the planet is technology that lasts, which is why we design our products to be durable and rarely require maintenance or repair.

“But when a repair is needed, we want customers to have many options for safe, reliable, and secure repair.

“That’s why we’re excited to launch self-service repair in Europe, giving our customers direct access to genuine Apple parts, tools, and manuals.”

Now there is Daisy, or rather double Daisy, Dave, and Taz. These aren't members of a manufactured pop band but rather Apple's evolving team of advanced de-manufacturing robots.

For the last six years, Apple has been on a mission to develop far more sophisticated and less wasteful machinery and processes for recycling e-waste, specifically that found in redundant iPhones. And that de-manufacturing idea is key.

Apple Daisy and team battle e-waste

Most e-waste recycling is an exercise in relatively crude crushing and crunching. It renders smartphones – an estimated 12 per cent of all e-waste – and other technology so much fiddly fragments. This makes sorting, separating, retrieving, and recycling precious metals and materials tricky to impossible. Daisy and team have been designed to take apart iPhones with (almost) as much care and attention as they were put together.

As part of its broader material recovery strategy, Apple identified 14 priority materials – from metals including gold and tungsten to paper – that make up 90 per cent of the ingredients used in its devices and packaging, many of which were being recovered in low quantities, in low quality or not at all by existing recycling methods.

An efficient way to pick iPhones apart

The extraction of many of these materials carries a high social as well as environmental cost. Around five per cent of an iPhone’s weight is cobalt. And 60 per cent of the world’s increasingly scarce cobalt is mined, often by hand and in terrible conditions, in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

The problem with recovering these materials from a smartphone is that it packs them, in secure and complex ways, in a very small space. An iPhone is more than a powerful computer, chips and circuit boards, it is a camera, music player and more. The camera module alone contains tin, copper, gold and other rare earth materials. There are also lenses and tiny speakers to retrieve and disassemble. Apple needed to find an efficient way to pick iPhones apart.

Set up in 2016, Liam was Apple’s first stab at a robot-manned de-manufacturing line. It could only handle iPhone 5s and it took 12 minutes to dissemble each one. This was unfeasibly slow but worked as a proof of concept. Liam 2.0 was a full 30m long, employing a row of 29 separate robots. It sped up the de-production process, but one fundamental time-sucking problem was holding it back. Robots make slow work of unscrewing tiny screws. Liam was replaced by Daisy in 2018 and it abandoned delicacy and applied brute force, simply punching a hole around screws. This was the key feasibility unlock.

A 10m-long, five-robot reverse production line, Daisy is made up of four cells that break down an iPhone into 15 component parts. Cell one opens up the phone, another uses minus-80-degree Celsius cold air to nullify the adhesive that attaches the battery to the housing, another punches out screws, while the final cell separates components from the housing. Armed with sophisticated AI, Daisy can now identify 23 different models of iPhone and process one every 18 seconds, in whatever order they come.

Robot Dave, meanwhile, tackles the iPhone's 'Taptic Engine' to recover tungsten, copper and gold and its steel enclosure. Taz then separates magnets from plastics in speakers. Humans appear at the end of the chain to manually sort and separate materials.

Towards circularity

That might seem like a lot of effort but – given the colossal wastefulness of extraction – Daisy and co have an outsize impact. One metric ton of recovered iPhone parts avoids the mining of 2,000 metric tons of metal-rich rock.

Daisy is sold as a key part of Apple’s progress towards full circularity. It hasn’t put a timescale on achieving that goal and many commentators argue that, given the complexities of Apple’s resource-hungry products and its supply chain, it’s an all-but-impossible dream. Apple, though, has made advances. It has been using recycled tungsten since iPhone 12 and 100 per cent recycled certified gold since iPhone 13. In the financial year 2021, 20 per cent of material Apple shipped came from recycled sources and the 13-inch MacBook Air has 40 per cent recycled content. It has also been investing in establishing industry-wide bona fides for recycled material.

The problem for Apple, leaving it open to accusations that Daisy is more PR stunt than practical solution, is the limited supply of old, unrepairable or un-resalable devices. There’s currently one Daisy in the Netherlands to handle permanently retired European iPhones and another in Texas at Apple's Material Recovery Lab, helping take care of US business. A single Daisy could disassemble up to 1.2 million iPhones every year and Apple is keen to have four of five Daisies up and running as soon as possible. At the moment, though, neither Daisy is working at anywhere near full capacity.

Too many of us stash our old phones away in drawers or use third-party trade-in services. The battle now is to incentivise people to return phones to Apple so they can be refurbed – in the 2021 fiscal year, Apple sent 12.2 million refurbed devices to good new homes – or fed to Daisy. Apple does now have its own trade-in service, which can be used to offset the cost of an upgrade. And in the 2021 financial year that helped push 38,000 metric tonnes of e-waste to recycling.

While notorious for its privacy around product development, Apple is open-sourcing the tricks and technology behind its materials recovery programme, hoping that other tech companies and recycling specialists will adopt, adapt and perhaps even advance those processes. Critics argue that Daisy clones are too expensive an option for third-party recyclers and none have, as yet, taken up the option to create one.

iPhone 12: ready for recycling? (Image credit: press)

On a more positive note, and despite the yearly roll-out of faster, smarter best-ever devices, more and more of us are holding on to our phones for longer. Upgrades now feel more like marginal gains than absolute musts. And Apple insists that durability and longevity of devices is now a priority. It has also gone some way to answering the demands of the ‘right to repair’ movement. Early last year it made spare parts and repair manuals for the iPhone 12 and 13 available in the US, a service that will soon be extended to the iPhone 14 and some MacBooks. It went live in Europe and the UK in early December.

Of course, Apple is still very much in the business of selling new iPhones. It is estimated that 240m were sold in 2021, despite the pandemic, and iPhone sales account for over half of Apple’s revenue. Efficiently dealing with smartphone e-waste is only going to become more of a problem. It is, though, also big, profitable business – if done properly – and recycling specialists are making advances. Daisy isn’t the only show in town. But while a Daisy army might not be the sole solution to putting smartphone parts back into circulation, they are the smartest, sharpest tool available.

It seems the company knows that it fails to reach these consumers — Apple once considered releasing a plastic iPad with a keyboard to compete with Chromebooks. It never happened, but maybe it should have.

A plastic iPad bundled with a cheaper keyboard

According to a recent Bloomberg report, Apple has internally considered launching an iPad with a plastic back (which I assume would look like a giant iPhone 5c). But more than that, this iPad would also come with a plastic keyboard included in the box.

With this product, Apple wanted to compete in the Chromebook segment, which costs less than $200 depending on the model. The goal was to sell the plastic iPad plus keyboard for less than $500. This project never saw the light of day until now, and the report says that the idea was probably “abandoned” by Apple.

Still, it’s clear that Apple wants to compete with cheaper tablets and laptops in some way. It’s no wonder that the ninth-generation iPad remains in lineup for the same $329 as before, while the iPad 10 was released for $449. The company is quite aware that its new product is not exactly appealing to schools.

Where the iPad fails as an alternative for schools

To be fair, I don’t think the problem is the price of the iPad itself, although the new iPad 10 is quite expensive for what it offers. The $329 ninth-generation iPad certainly has more capable hardware than most Chromebooks in the same price category. But Apple definitely has a weak spot when it comes to iPad accessories.

Even Chromebooks that cost less than $200 are equipped with a keyboard and trackpad by default. On the other hand, Apple doesn’t ship any of the iPads with a keyboard.

Let’s take the new 10th-generation iPad as an example. It is priced at $449 for its 64GB Wi-Fi version, but many students will also want a keyboard to use it as a laptop. Apple’s new Smart Keyboard Folio, which is a full keyboard with a trackpad, costs $249. This puts the iPad 10 in the $700 price range, which is almost the price of an M1 MacBook Air.

For iPad 9, Apple still sells the original Smart Keyboard (with no trackpad) for $159. It is definitely cheaper than Apple’s fancier keyboards but still costs almost the same as an entire Chromebook. Together, iPad 9 plus Smart Keyboard cost at least $488. And, if you consider the Apple Pencil price, that’s $99 more.

Microsoft sells its own keyboard with built-in trackpad for the $399 Surface Go tablet for less than $100. At this point, the full iPad kit is much more expensive than its competitors. Regular consumers certainly don’t mind spending more for an iPad, but this is not the case for many schools and students.

How could Apple change this?

The idea of having a plastic iPad may not be the best way to push the iPad into the entry level tablet market. After all, the $329 iPad is made of aluminum. However, there are a few things the company could do to make the iPad more appealing to students.

Personally, I think Apple should focus on having only one entry-level model instead of two. A $399 price point would be a sweet spot for iPad 10. But more than that, Magic Keyboard Folio should cost much less than $249 – I’d suggest $159 at most. This way, consumers would have an iPad plus keyboard combo for under $560 that can compete even with mid-range laptops.

And if Apple really wants to keep selling its old iPads with a decade-old design like iPad 9, it should start at $299 with Smart Keyboard priced at $99.

Apple CEO: ‘Challenging Environment’ Hurt Holiday Device Sales

Dylan Martin

A boost in services and iPad revenue was not enough to offset Apple’s sales slump for iPhones, Macs and wearables in the first quarter of its 2023 fiscal year, which ended in December. ‘I’m proud of the way we have navigated circumstances, seen and unforeseen, over the past several years, and I remain incredibly confident in our team and our mission and in the work we do every day,’ CEO Tim Cook says.

Apple CEO Tim Cook said a “challenging environment” caused the iPhone giant’s device sales to plunge during last year’s holiday season.

The Cupertino, California-based company reported on Thursday that it made $117.2 billion in revenue for the first quarter of its 2023 fiscal year, which ended Dec. 31, 2022. That was a 5 percent decline from the same period a year ago, and it was roughly $4 billion below the average estimate of Wall Street analysts. Apple’s earnings per share was $1.88, also below expectations.

“I’m proud of the way we have navigated circumstances, seen and unforeseen, over the past several years, and I remain incredibly confident in our team and our mission and in the work we do every day,” Cook said during the company’s earnings call.

Cook cited three factors that contributed to Apple’s holiday sales slump. First, “foreign exchange headwinds” impacted revenue by nearly 800 basis points.

Second, production challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic in China “significantly impacted” the supply of Apple’s new iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max devices. This contributed to Apple’s iPhone revenue declining by 8 percent year-over-year to $65.8 billion in the first quarter.

For the third factor, Cook also cited the “enduring impacts of the pandemic” as well as inflation and Russia’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine among the “unprecedented circumstances” faced by the world.

“And we know that Apple is not immune to it. But whatever conditions we face, our approach is always the same. We are thoughtful and deliberate. We manage for the long term,” he said.

Among the company’s product lines, Macs suffered the largest plummet with a 29 percent decline, resulting in $7.7 billion in revenue for the category.

Cook said the holiday season was a “difficult compare” to the previous one when Apple released the redesigned MacBook Pros with the company’s homegrown Arm-compatible M1 chips. The sales slump was also the result of “challenging macroeconomic environment and foreign exchange headwinds.”

However, Cook said, Apple is bullish on Mac’s future, in part because of the recently announced MacBook Pro notebooks using the company’s new M2 Pro and M2 Max chips.

Besides Mac and iPhone, the other device category that saw a decline in the first quarter was the group containing Apple’s wearables, smart home devices and accessories. The category saw an 8 percent year-over-year decline in revenue, bringing it to $13.5 billion for the period.

“However, our installed base of devices in the category set a new all-time record thanks to the largest number of customers new to a smartwatch that we’ve ever had in a given quarter,” said Luca Maestri, Apple’s CFO, on the earnings call.

The one bright spot in Apple’s hardware portfolio was the iPad. In contrast to the rest of the company’s device segments, iPad revenue grew 30 percent year-over-year to $9.4 billion for the quarter.

Maestri said iPad sales growth was in part the result of the company having “enough supply to meet demand” in contrast to the 2021 holiday season when there were “significant supply constraints.” Sales also received a boost from last fall’s launch of the new M2-powered iPad Pro.

“The iPad installed base reached a new all-time high thanks to incredible customer loyalty and a high number of new customers. In fact, over half of the customers who purchased iPads during the quarter were new to the product,” Maestri said.

These products combined resulted in Apple’s total device revenue declining 8 percent year-over-year in the first quarter to $96.4 billion.

The iPhone maker’s services revenue, on the other hand, increased 6 percent to $20.7 billion in the first quarter compared to the same period a year ago. This was an “all-time revenue record,” according to Cook. Contributing to that was double-digit revenue growth from App Store subscriptions as well as new revenue records for cloud and payment services, among other categories.

While Apple continued its practice of not giving revenue guidance for the next quarter, Maestri said the company expects year-over-year sales in the second quarter to be on par with the first. This is based on Apple’s projections that services revenue will grow, Mac and iPad sales will decline, and iPhone sales will improve during the period, which ends in March.

New Zealand-based company VentureFruit has unveiled Tutti, the world’s first branded apple variety bred specifically for production in hot climates.

Twenty years in the making, Tutti’s commercial launch at Fruit Logistica in Berlin follows five years of extensive research and production trials under the variety name HOT84A1.

Morgan Rogers, VentureFruit’s general manager, described Tutti as a stand-out apple which meets both grower and consumer needs.

“With the world’s climate changing, it’s vital innovative new varieties are developed to withstand high temperatures and enable growers across all major continents to adapt and have sustainable businesses, while providing consumers with great tasting apples,” he commented, “and that’s what Tutti delivers.”

In Spain, for example, challenging growing conditions and extreme daytime temperatures of over 40 degrees, combined with warmer nights, make it difficult to grow apples.

“Tutti solves this challenge,” said Morgan. “It has been specifically bred to grow in hot conditions and produce a deliciously light crisp apple, with bright red skin and a rounded sweet fresh flavour. Tutti also grows successfully in different growing conditions, having been tested throughout Europe, including Italy, France, Germany, Switzerland and the UK.”

He added: “With today’s commercial launch of the variety, we now invite interested parties from across Europe to submit their interest in being a Tutti licence holder and growing this innovative new apple variety.”

Product pipeline

Tutti is the first apple brand to be released commercially by the Hot Climate Partnership (HCP), a collaboration between Spanish institute IRTA, New Zealand’s Plant & Food Research, Catalonian producer association Fruit Futur, and VentureFruit, a genetics and variety management business created by NZ multinational T&G Global.

HCP was founded in 2002 in response to challenges experienced by Spanish growers. Its specific aim is to develop new varieties of apples and pears and release them commercially. Initiated in 2002.

At present, it has an extensive pipeline of apple and pear varieties, 13 of which are now in their final years of evaluation and testing.

This includes consumer sensory research conducted across key markets to help shape the commercial proposition of each new variety.

Following the release of Tutti, VentureFruit expects to commercialise an additional five new apple and pear varieties over the next seven years, all of which have been specifically bred to be tolerant of hot climates.

A climate of collaboration

T&G Global’s chief executive Gareth Edgecombe said the strength of the unique HCP was its combined scientific, growing and commercialisation expertise.

“Addressing the potential impact of climate change on the world’s apple and pear sector is not something one business can do, it takes collaboration, knowledge sharing, commitment and a vision for what is possible,” he said.

“Through the dedication of our partnership and testing partners, the Hot Climate Partnership addresses both climate change mitigation and adaptation. Innovative varieties like Tutti can grow in warm and rising temperatures, while at the same time potentially help open up new growing regions which previously may have been unsuitable for growing apples and pears given their climatic conditions.

“It’s innovative solutions like Tutti that our sector needs to meet the evolving needs of our global consumers and customers, and ensure we continue to build a sustainable and resilient sector.”

Brand benefits

The brand name Tutti was chosen to underline the variety’s potential benefit to growers, who want more sustainable production, and to consumers, who want a great-tasting apple.

Kate James, business development manager at VentureFruit, said the name was also chosen to reflect the fun, fresh feeling of the eating experience, as well as the programme’s core concept.

“Tutti’s translation means ‘everyone’ or ‘all together’ in Italian, a concept at the very heart of the Hot Climate Partnership, which is delivering better solutions for growers, consumers and retailers,” she said.

“Its brand tagline ‘love every bite’ promises to meet the test of a great apple – how it tastes. With commercial plantings already underway, we can’t wait to see Tutti apples on retailers shelves.*

Tutti will be sold and marketed through a peer-to-peer network that allows participating third-party licence-holders to grow, market and sell the variety within their licensed territory according to agreed brand specifications.

The new variety is open for licensing to all growers, fresh produce sales and marketing companies, and plant nurseries.","VentureFruit unveils Tutti, world’s first ever hot-climate apple"

(WTOC) - It may just look like a bunch of trees but one organization is using this land to help farmers understand sustainable practices.

Apple and the McIntosh Sustainable Environment and Economic Development are launching a new initiative to support Black landowners.

Organizers say the goal of the project is help farmers be able to sustain their land in order to pass it down for generations.

“We have not been exposed to this type of education, even with Forrest professionals, even with the state of Georgia, or culturally. It’s just not been a party in our communities. And so we’re bringing that focus and attention to forestry and forestry professionals into our communities,” said John Littles, the exceutive director of McIntosh S.E.E.D.

The next-generation CarPlay experience will be able to provide content across multiple screens within a vehicle, and deeper integration with a vehicle's hardware will allow users to control the radio, adjust climate controls, and more directly within CarPlay. Apple said the new version of CarPlay will also seamlessly display a vehicle's speedometer, fuel level, temperature, and more on the instrument cluster.



Apple added that CarPlay users will be able to personalize their driving experience by choosing different gauge cluster designs, and widgets will provide at-a-glance information from the Weather and Music apps right on a vehicle's dashboard.

Apple said the first vehicles to support the new CarPlay experience will be announced in late 2023, with committed automakers including Ford, Lincoln, Mercedes-Benz, Infiniti, Honda, Acura, Jaguar, Land Rover, Audi, Nissan, Volvo, Porsche, and more. Apple said it will share more information about the new CarPlay experience in the future.

Introduced in 2014, CarPlay is Apple's in-vehicle software platform that can be accessed through a vehicle's infotainment system when an iPhone is connected to the vehicle with a Lightning cable or wirelessly in vehicles that support wireless CarPlay.","Apple Announces Multi-Display CarPlay With Integrated Speedometer, Climate Controls, and More"

A “test balloon” hack on England’s Cybersecurity Division leaves surly director Richard Banks (Peter Mullan) shaken. His associate Alison Rowdy (Green) agrees, and the two begin investigating as more and more cyberattacks lead to train derailments and flooding from the Thames.

Meanwhile, in Damascus, French military contractor Gabriel Delage (Cassel) is tasked with protecting a pair of Syrian white-hat hackers and the information they’ve unveiled about the hacks. Things go poorly, as predicted, and Gabriel ends up back in London to track them down again—ending right back in Alison’s orbit. You see, a lifetime ago, they were lovers in an anti-war activist group. Everything went to pot during a particularly flammable street protest, and the two parted ways. Now, they’ve got to work together to save themselves, the hackers, and, it seems, the world.

If “Liaison” got to this point earlier, with Green and Cassel glowering at each other with white-hot erotic heat as they dug barbs out of their scarred backs or made out while gunfire raged around them, it could have been quite the pulpy ride. Unfortunately, Brac’s expanded scope involves reams of scenes in conference rooms, offices, and hideouts, with an expanding cast of unremarkable character actors playing nondescript government flacks and corporate spies.

They all have overlapping motivations and allegiances, fighting for their slice of the hack-attack pie. It’s all so dull, and it goes on for far too long. (Even stalwarts like Kieslowski regular Irène Jacob get lost in all the boring bureaucracy.) You’ve got to sit through two solid episodes of drudgery before Cassel and Green finally reunite, staring longingly at each other through opposite sides of a rainy window, and by then, it’s too little, too late.","Vincent Cassel, Eva Green Waste Time on Dull Spycraft in Apple TV+'s Liaison"

A month after launching it in the US, Apple has made its Emergency SOS safety service, which uses satellite connectivity, available in France, Germany, Ireland and the UK. “Available on all iPhone 14 models, the innovative technology enables users to message with emergency services while outside of cellular and Wi-Fi coverage. Additionally, if users want to reassure friends and family of their whereabouts while travelling in an area with no cellular or Wi-Fi coverage, they can now open the Find My app and share their location via satellite,” notes Apple in this announcement. Enabling communications services beyond the reach of terrestrial networks has been a major trend in the telecom sector this year thanks to companies such as T-Mobile US, SpaceX/Starlink and AST SpaceMobile and Omnispace – see T-Mobile US and SpaceX plot to kill mobile ‘dead zones’.

Elon Musk might just look back at 2022 as a defining year in his business life for many reasons, of course, but primarily for the impact of his ultimately enforced move to acquire Twitter for $44bn. According to The Guardian (citing research by Forbes and Bloomberg), Musk is no longer the richest person in the world, with his personal worth having been hit by the decrease in the value of his shares in electric vehicle giant Tesla, of which Musk is CEO and its largest shareholder. Tesla’s stock price has lost more than half of its value since Musk bid for Twitter, where much of the billionaire’s attention seems to be focused these days (and let’s not forget he also runs satellite firm SpaceX…). According to the bean counters, Musk is now worth just $177bn (shed a tear please folks). Musk’s crown has been taken by French tycoon Bernard Arnault, the co-founder, chairman and CEO at the LVMH empire that includes Louis Vuitton and Sephora: He is believed to be worth $188bn. But is he happy? Probably.

Sticking with Musk, and much more importantly… According to Sprudge, which describes itself as “the world’s most popular coffee publication, a global hub for coffee culture and original journalism since 2009,” Twitter, as part of a broader effort to sell “anything not bolted to the floor” at the social media firm’s San Francisco headquarters, is auctioning “a pretty astounding amount of coffee gear. That “gear” includes “no less than five espresso machines… including one three-group La Marzocco Strada, three one-group Linea EEs, and a Unic Tango automatic for good measure. But what good is an espresso machine without a grinder? Luckily, two Mazzer Super Jollys are on the chopping block as well as four BUNN grinders. And there are three FETCO CBS-2152-2-XTS double automatic coffee brewers to round out your lightly used coffee shop necessities,” notes Sprudge’s Zac Cadwalader. The reason this is all being sold, according to speculation, is not so that Musk can raise a few greenbacks and take back the title of world’s most filthy-rich person, but because Twitter’s HQ will move to Texas for tax reasons and Elon’s van isn’t big enough to take all the furniture. What we should be focused on, though, is that there is some quality hardware up for grabs for anyone in the Bay area and, remember folks, this is hardware that CANNOT be virtualised. These are monuments of physical beauty.

Sustainability is increasingly considered one of the most pressing goals for businesses. According to Vodafone Business’s latest “Fit for the Future” report, it has become “a strategic priority for businesses” that find themselves under increased pressure from consumers and investors. Looking at US enterprises, this priority is now considered “a competitive advantage”, with more than 60% of the 301 US companies surveyed by Vodafone citing sustainability as a potential differentiator, while more than half have made it a strategic goal. Additionally, the implementation of sustainable practices has realised “significant benefits” for businesses as 47% of those that reported higher profits this year have a formal environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) programme in place. Only 22% of firms with lower profits had implemented such programmes.

Staying on topic… A number of telcos have received recognition by global non-profit organisation CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project) for their climate management efforts. Companies that were awarded the highest level of ranking, the so-called “A List”, include Telefónica, Tele2, NEC and KDDI.

Openreach, BT’s quasi-autonomous wholesale fixed access network operator, is in the news today because of its latest controversial discounted pricing offer for ISPs, but it’s also been attracting attention for some traffic stats from the weekend, as it claims more data traffic was carried over its network on Sunday 11 December than on any previous single day. Some “229 petabytes of data was carried across the network, compared to the previous highest day, Sunday 5 December 2021,” when 222 petabytes traversed the network. (One petabyte equals 1 million gigabytes and, according to Openreach, an average 4K resolution movie stream eats up about 7.2 gigabytes per hour.) That’s a lot of data, but quite how much that is per active Openreach wholesale line connection is a stat we’re still waiting to see if the operator will share.

According to the Tech Transparency Project (TTP), Apple is currently a member of a range of industry associations that appear to oppose reducing greenhouse gas emissions and ‘right-to-repair’ legislation.

Data from the TTP reveals how the number of lobbying groups funded by companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon has increased since 2015. This week, the campaign group added Apple to its tracker, and though the company backs fewer lobbyists than its Big Tech rivals, the groups it does support appear to be at odds with the company’s stated position on environmental issues.

Apple aims to become carbon neutral by 2030. “Every company should be a part of the fight against climate change,” CEO Tim Cook said in a statement last October. ""We must act quickly to invest in a greener and more equitable future.”

But according to the company’s mandatory lobbying disclosures to the EU, Apple is a member of BusinessEurope, a Brussels-headquartered lobby group. TTP argues that while BusinessEurope’s public positions appear to be pro-environment, the group has “consistently acted to slow regulation and legislation” aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

BusinessEurope was also identified by think tank InfluenceMap as one of the top five “most negatively influential” industry lobby groups on Paris-aligned climate policy, which supports the Paris Agreement's long-term mitigation goal of limiting global warming to well below 2°C.

And according to InfluenceMap’s findings, BusinessEurope, together with other industry associations have lobbied to water down the EU’s reform plans on the climate, specifically on the bloc’s approach to carbon emissions.

""Many leading global companies, including Apple, now have ambitious climate strategies,” said Dylan Tanner, executive director of InfluenceMap. ""However, there remains a disconnect between these companies and the powerful industry groups they are members of

“Industry groups such as BusinessEurope continue to pose a significant blockage for global climate action, and yet their member companies remain largely silent about this growing gap.” He added that this disconnect is a “pervasive problem” that has long held back progressive climate policy and that green investors are now keenly aware of associations with such groups.

According to corporate spending data, Apple spent $13m on lobbying policymakers in the US and in Europe last year. This amount was half the amount spent by Facebook, but not significantly less than Google’s funding in 2021. Tech Monitor has previously reported on the sheer scale of Big Tech’s lobbying efforts in the US and elsewhere.

Apple lobbying opposes 'right to repair'

Meanwhile, the TTP’s research also found that Apple is currently a member of 11 other industry groups opposed to ‘right-to-repair’ policies.

The right-to-repair movement has long argued for the longer use of electronic products to generally reduce the industry’s use of raw materials to build and sell new products. Last year, Apple’s co-founder Steve Wozniak threw his support behind the movement, saying that advocates for right-to-repair are “doing the right thing”.

In November 2021, Apple ditched its long-held stance against the right-to-repair by announcing a self service repair policy that provides its customers with hardware to repair their own devices. However, a New York Times journalist described his experience with the self service repair initiative as a “disaster” as well as how a technician he hired to help him said that Apple was “setting up the customer to fail”.

The environmental benefits of repairing electronic products instead of discarding them after a short period of use are clear. Researchers at the Oeko-Institut in Germany found that using a smartphone for seven years would save approximately 100kg of greenhouse gases, compared with using it for just two and a half years.

And according to the United Nation’s Global E-waste Monitor, a record 53.6 million metric tonnes (Mt) of e-waste was generated globally in 2019, and the total amount of e-waste produced is projected to hit 74 Mt by 2030. Limited options for repair, coupled with higher consumption rates and short life cycles means that e-waste is the world’s fastest-growing domestic waste stream.

Despite this, four of the industry groups of which Apple is a member provided testimony arguing against a ‘right-to-repair’ bill in Washington, according to TTP’s research. “That raises the question of whether Apple is still trying to kill or soften right-to-repair legislation through its trade groups,” said the report's authors.

These lobbying efforts appear to be paying off. Yesterday, it was revealed that right-to-repair legislation in California, that would have required companies including Apple to provide documentation and tools to product owners and repair shops, has been abandoned. A report suggested that intense lobbying by tech companies might have played a part in scrapping the proposed laws.

But there’s no need to fret just yet if you enjoy buying stuff with cold, hard cash. Plastic cards are first on the chopping block.

“I’d suggest that the time is ripe to plan for plastic (and metal) cards to be sent to Shady Pines Retirement Home for the Tragically Overstayed Welcome,” wrote Nick Holland, global head of insights and networks at Money 20/20. During the group’s 2022 conference in October in Las Vegas, financial technology companies touting efficiency and seamless experiences were front and center, as plastic cards faded into the background.

Anyone who is on the fence about using their smartphone for contactless payments should check out Whitson Gordon’s case for adopting the technology. Convinced and need guidance setting up Apple Pay or Google Wallet? Apple and Google offer step-by-step instructions to guide you through that initial setup. After you link your cards to the mobile device and practice the necessary steps to complete purchases, here are a few tips to help you get the most out of smartphone wallets.

Don’t Forget About Phone-to-Phone Payments

You may be comfortable tapping your phone against a checkout terminal, but it might feel like a surprise the first time a business asks you to tap your phone to their phone. Smaller merchants, delivery companies, and take-out restaurants may continue to forgo traditional card terminals altogether as companies like Mastercard and Visa introduce features that use near-field communication chip technology to enable phone-to-phone payments. Similar to the lightning port on the iPhone, the era of credit card readers plugged into smartphones is likely to come to an end.

Make Use of Virtual Card Numbers

Always look to see what your options are when it comes to virtual card numbers. For example, if you choose to get an Apple Card on your iPhone and the number leaks, it can be changed with just a couple of taps. Open your Wallet and tap on the Apple Card. In the top-right corner, select the card icon and choose the button that reads Request New Card Number. Virtual card numbers are not only useful for smartphone payments. Google added the option to use the security feature easily in your web browser.

Add More Than Just Payment Methods

Your debit card and credit card are likely the very first items you connect to your digital wallet. It doesn’t need to stop there! From boarding passes to proof-of-vaccine cards, digital wallets can hold so much more than just payments. It’s even possible to connect your health insurance card for easy access.

Keep a Little Cash on Hand

Are you finding yourself scrambling for storage on your iPhone? Do you regularly have to deal with annoying Storage Full pop-ups that appear just when you’re ready to download an app or take an important photo or video? The solution may not be what you think it is. Even though Apple offers storage solutions, Tech Expert David Brayton, author of Electricalwheel.com, says you should never waste your money on this storage upgrade.

What Is A Storage Upgrade In Apple?

First thing’s first: what exactly is a storage upgrade in Apple? “The storage upgrade in a device is an increase in the amount of space that is available for storing data,” Brayton said. “This can be accomplished by adding more memory to the device, or by using a larger capacity storage device such as a hard drive.”

According to Brayton, you should never waste your money on this storage upgrade for two primary reasons:

“First, upgrading your storage is not going to improve your overall system performance,” Brayton said. “Sure, you may get a slight boost in speed, but it’s not going to be significant enough to warrant the cost of the upgrade. Second, most people never come close to using all the storage they have available to them. Unless you’re a power user with a lot of demanding applications, you’ll likely find that your current storage capacity is more than sufficient.”

What You Should Do Instead To Gain Back Storage

Don’t worry, if you’re looking to gain back storage on your iPhone, there are a few things you can do. First, take a look at what’s taking up the most space on your device, Brayton recommends. “If you have a lot of music or photos, consider storing them elsewhere, like in the cloud or on an external drive,” Brayton said. “You can also delete any unused apps or clear out old files and data that you no longer need.”

Another option is to upgrade to a larger-capacity iPhone. “This way, you’ll have more space for the things you want to keep on your device,” Brayton said. “Whatever route you choose, make sure you’re proactive about gaining back storage on your iPhone so you can keep using it without issue.”

You don’t have to deal with constant storage pop-ups — take proactive steps that free up space or plan in advance if you suspect you’ll need more space.",Apple Experts Say You Should Never Waste Your Money On This Storage Upgrade

Apple said Thursday it fought through a ""challenging operating environment"" to keep sales on track in the second quarter, but that the company plans to be more ""deliberate"" with spending decisions, including hiring in the coming months.

The tech giant announced that it generated more revenue from iPhones, iPad, and services (like the app store) than Wall Street expected, helping its overall sales grow to nearly $83 billion, essentially in line with Wall Street's estimates.

Shares of Apple rose 3% in recent after-hours trading.

""This quarter's record results speak to Apple's constant efforts to innovate, to advance new possibilities, and to enrich the lives of our customers,"" said Tim Cook, Apple's CEO, said in the company's earnings release.

Despite Apple's strong quarterly results, there were some weak spots. Revenue for Mac computers was lower than expected and saw its first revenue decline since the start of the pandemic when people rushed to purchase new at-home tech gear.

Cook said Mac computer weakness was primarily due to lockdowns in China taking out Apple's ""primary source of supply"" for Mac units.

In addition, the company's wearables, home, and accessories division saw sales fall to $8.08 billion from $8.78 billion a year earlier.

Sales to Asia's most populated countries signified some of the pain: Revenue in both China and Japan were lower than in the same quarter a year ago.

Cook did not explicitly say Apple is slowing hiring amid the challenging macroeconomic environment but told CNBC, ""we do see inflation in our cost structure. we see it in things like logistics and wages and certain silicon components, and we're still hiring, but we're doing it on a deliberate basis.""",Apple says it fought through a 'challenging operating environment' to keep quarterly sales on track

According to a notification appearing on the app’s home screen, Dark Sky will no longer be available as of January 1, 2023, as its forecasting technology has now been integrated with Apple’s own Weather application.

The news is not surprising, though it is disappointing.

Following the acquisition, Apple promptly wound down the Android and Wear OS versions of Dark Sky and said it would no longer accept signups for Dark Sky’s API, which had allowed third-party app developers to access the company’s database of weather forecasts and historical weather data. It later pushed back the API service’s closure until the end of 2022, and said the iOS app would shut down around the same time.

The writing was on the wall. After all, Dark Sky’s app had not been the key focus for Apple’s deal — it was the forecasting technology and the weather service itself.

Apple saw the potential in turning Dark Sky’s API into its own revenue-generating business. Previously, that API had offered 1,000 API calls for free, then charged $0.0001 for each subsequent call. At Apple’s WWDC 2022, alongside the launch of a default weather app for iPad, Apple announced it would transition the API’s paying customers to its new weather service, WeatherKit, where it would provide up to 500,000 API calls per month as part of its Apple Developer Program membership during the beta period and beyond.

It will then go on to charge businesses for additional data at the following rates:

1 million calls/month: US$49.99

2 million calls/month: US$99.99

5 million calls/month: US$249.99

10 million calls/month: US$499.99

20 million calls/month: US$999.99

As of yesterday’s iOS 16 launch, Apple also officially launched its WeatherKit subscriptions, noting developers could now access this weather data in apps built for iOS 16, iPadOS 16, macOS 13, tvOS 16 and watchOS 9 with a platform-specific Swift API and for other platforms with a REST API. Developers can upgrade for more calls or downgrade at any time via the Account tab in the Apple Developer app, the company noted.

Given this service is now live and integrated with Apple’s Weather app, it’s understandable that Apple will close Dark Sky’s iOS app. But the interesting thing here is that even though the Dark Sky app is directly pointing users to the Apple Weather app as part of its notification to existing users, Apple doesn’t necessarily have to convince those users to make the switch in order to benefit.

Because Apple bought Dark Sky’s backend weather data service, it will now have the chance to generate revenue whenever users turn to another third-party weather app that’s tapping into WeatherKit. For now, it’s unclear how many former Dark Sky API customers will make that transition, however, as the WeatherKit service has just gone live.

It is a shame to see Dark Sky’s consumer-facing product go, however. The well-designed app has been a longtime favorite for many, thanks to its easy-to-read user interface with tappable buttons for quickly swapping between forecasts for the day’s temperatures, precipitation probability, humidity, UV Index, and more, as well as its radar maps and customizable notifications. According to data from mobile intelligence firm Sensor Tower, the iOS app has seen nearly 2 million downloads to date

Thankfully, there’s still an ecosystem of third-party weather apps available that bring a little more visual flair to forecasts, if Apple’s own weather app doesn’t inspire. Among our favorites: CARROT Weather, (Not Boring) Weather, MyRadar and Clime (if you’re willing to subscribe).","As Apple’s WeatherKit launches, Dark Sky for iOS to wind down operations by year-end"

Now that we are officially entering the season of air pollution, there is one seasonal fruit that we can rely upon to boost our lung health. It is the creamy and luscious custard apple. It is believed to be rich in vitamin B6 or pyridoxine, which suppresses inflammation of the bronchial tubes that go to the lungs. That is why all asthmatics must have it during a changeover or pollen season. Ingesting the fruit is the most natural way of cleansing your lungs. In fact, the custard apple tree growing by the roadside has been found most resistant to air pollution, according to most studies.

Also known as Sitaphal or Sharifa in India, used for ages in folklore remedies and ayurvedic medicine, the health benefits of custard apple are being proven in various research studies now. The fruit, roots, leaves, bark and flesh are all used for their therapeutic properties.

But the many benefits get hidden by the fact that the fruit is sweet and, therefore, thought to be risky for diabetics or even those having cardio-vascular issues. But the total calorie count from a 100 g custard apple is 94 calories. Proteins are 2.1 gm, dietary fibres go up to 4.4 gms, total fat is 0.0 gms and carbohydrates are at 23.6 gms.

It has a moderate glycaemic index of 54 but a glycaemic load of 10.2. Given its multiple benefits, this works in diabetics if they keep to moderate or limited prescribed quantities. Custard apples are bestowed with polyphenolic antioxidants. These vastly elevate insulin production and glucose absorption, thereby keeping diabetes in check. Nutritionists advise consuming the fruit in small slices and including it in a meal, maybe in oatmeal, yogurt and smoothies, rather than eating it separately. The fruit increases the muscular uptake of glucose, thereby enhancing its peripheral utilisation. Since 20 mg vitamin C is present in 100 gm of custard apple, it impacts insulin production and helps reduce blood sugar. Also, magnesium, potassium and iron indirectly affect insulin production and thus control blood sugar. The rich fibres and seeds, which need to be pried open and had, cause slow digestion, build satiety, reduce snack cravings and keep sugar levels low.

Besides, the fruit can be had as a dessert, which would have done more harm than good.

There is a variety of custard apples available. Some typical varieties are Annona squamosa (Sitaphal), Bull’s heart fruit (Ramphal), Cherimoya (Lakshmanphal) and Soursop (Hanumanphal).

Get started with the fruit

The caloric content of custard apple is twice as much as an apple, which makes it an excellent energy replenisher. It provides an extensive amount of potassium, which helps in eliminating muscle weakness and improves blood circulation.

Keeps BP at bay

Custard apple consists of a well-balanced ratio of sodium and potassium which helps to regulate and control blood pressure fluctuations in the body. One small custard apple meets almost 10 per cent RDA (recommended dietary allowance) for magnesium that relaxes the heart muscles and reduces the risk of stroke.

Friend of the gut

A custard apple prevents ulcers, stomach problems and acidity owing to its anti-inflammatory properties. Just a 100 gm fruit contains 2.5 times more fibre than an apple and half the vitamin C of an orange. Also, its high magnesium helps in maintaining good bowel movements.

Calms you down

Custard apples are high in antioxidants, which protect our bodies from the damaging effects of free radicals, reduce oxidative stress and prevent diseases like cancer and coronary heart disease. Recent research on custard fruit leaves suggests that they may have anti-inflammatory, anti-tumour, anti-obesity, antioxidant, antiviral, and anti-microbial properties. The fruit provides B Complex vitamins. Thiamine, Riboflavin, Niacin, Vitamin B6 are present. These B complex vitamins control the brain’s GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) neuron chemical levels, which regulate our emotions, including depression and stress. Thus, vitamin B also helps you calm down. Everyone enjoys the fruit, but it may be messy and dangerous, especially for young children because eating the seeds unintentionally can cause choking. It is, therefore, preferable to use a masher to remove the seeds.

This delicious fruit is your greatest pal if you have lactose intolerance or are a vegan. And can be a wonderful plant-based alternative for dairy-based creams, condensed milk, caramel sauce and cream cheese in shakes, ice cream, cheese cakes as well as a few Indian desserts.

This increase in production, along with factors such as uncontrolled urbanization and the lack of appropriate waste management and recycling methods, leads to the accumulation of waste in the environment, which causes irreversible environmental damages1. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the production of fruits and vegetables in the world is more than 1.74 billion tons, of which 10–50 percent of it is wasted in different countries. The value of food waste in the world is estimated at US$ 1 trillion annually. The resources used to produce that amount of wasted food are responsible for the emission of 4.4 gigatons of greenhouse gases (equivalent to CO 2 ) per year, making wasted food the third-largest producer of greenhouse gases in the world after China and the United States2.

The extent of food losses varies at different stages of the production chain depending on the type of product, the level of economic development, and the social and cultural conditions in a geographical area. In the case of fruits and vegetables, according to the FAO study, wastage in the harvesting, sorting, and grading stages is predominant in industrial areas. In developing areas, while food loss is high during the harvesting, sorting, and grading stages, the amount of wastage during the processing stage (14–21%) is much higher than in developed areas (less than 2%)2,3. This is while most fruit products are processed before consumption, so in addition to increasing the value, also maintains the quality and number of fruits on the market4. Large amounts of waste are accumulated during the processing, which imposes high costs for treatments to reduce environmental detriment5,6. Thus, fruit processing waste not only accounts for significant amounts of food waste, which means serious environmental damage but also indicates the loss of nutrients of high value7. Therefore, the conversion of waste into value-added products is important and necessary to improve the sustainability and efficiency of the food supply chain8.

Over the years, in numerous studies, the production of value-added products, through microbial conversion or enzymatic processes of fruit wastes such as enzymes, bioethanol, organic acids, heteropolysaccharides, aromatic compounds, protein-fortified feed, prebiotic oligosaccharides, and bioactive compounds, has been investigated9. Microbial processing of residual fruit fibers is a relatively new approach that uses waste as monomers for the synthesis of natural beneficial oligomers10.

In general, the structure of the fruit is composed of various compounds with different properties. After water, the highest abundance belongs to carbohydrates, which make up 50 to 80% of the dry weight in most fruits11. A large number of carbohydrates in fruit waste are types of dietary fiber, of which pectin makes up to 40% of the compounds12. Pectins are a family of high molecular weight acidic polysaccharides, which are abundant in the primary cell wall of plants, made primarily from d-galacturonic acid units in the main chain with α (1-4) linkage along with small amounts of rhamnose in the main chain and arabinose, galactose and xylose in the side chains10,13. Several studies have demonstrated the applications of pectin in the food and pharmaceutical industries. Studies have suggested that short-chain pectins have wider applications, such as prebiotic, anti-cancer agents, drug delivery systems, radical scavenging properties, cholesterol-lowering, etc., and those features are related to the structure and molecular weight of pectic compounds10,14.

Radical species are associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, diabetes, inflammation, cardiovascular disease, and myocardial infarction. Synthetic antioxidants commonly used in manufacturing processes are considered to be the cause of cytotoxicity. On the other hand, natural polysaccharides are considered to be reliable antioxidants that can scavenge free radicals and overcome synthetic substances that pose health concerns. The compounds rich in rhamnogalacturonan I as well as the compounds consisting of homogalacturonan in the main chain and rhamnogalacturonan I and arabinogalactan in the side chains show the highest level of antioxidant properties; Therefore, the antioxidant properties of pectic compounds can be traced to the structure of rhamnogalacturonan I, homogalacturonan and arabinogalactan15. Oligogalacturonic acids derived from pectin, modified by various treatments also can purify compounds including anion superoxide, hydroxyl, and reactive oxygen species. They also increase the antioxidant properties of enzymes: superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase and show antioxidant properties by increasing the amount of glutathione16.

Another promising biological activity of pectin is its potential role in preventing and reducing carcinogenesis. The positive effects of “modified pectin”, whether in the form of commercial products such as modified citrus pectin (e.g. GCS-100, FPP, or pectasol) or laboratory-modified pectin, have been studied and proven. Citrus modified pectin (MCP) in particular has been and is under extensive research17. Not all MCPs are the same because the term is used to describe water-soluble polysaccharides derived from pectin produced from citrus peel and pulp treated with high temperature, high pH, or enzymatic decomposition. pH-modified citrus pectin has reduced molecular weight and is derived from commercial citrus pectin and has galactose-rich side chains that are capable of binding to the prometastatic protein galactin-3 and inhibiting tumor cell metastasis. Galactin-3 plays a key role in several intracellular physiological and pathological processes, including tumor cell proliferation and apoptosis. The binding of MCP to galactin-3 may inhibit the negative effects of galactin-3, such as inhibiting its ability to promote adhesion and migration of tumor cells and prevent apoptosis. In addition to galactose-rich side chains, the homogalacturonan part of pectin also has anti-cancer activity. Low molecular weight pectin fragments (1 kDa) rich in galacturonic acid were absorbed by mouse and human cancer cells, which inhibited the growth of these cells and led to the release of lactate dehydrogenase and galactin-3 from them. In addition to interacting with galactin-3, some other potential anticancer effects of modified pectins have been reported in both in vitro and in vivo conditions18. Low molecular weight citrus fractionated pectin powder (FPP) produced by autoclave hydrolysis or a combination of heating and enzymatic hydrolysis also induces androgen and androgen-independent prostate cancer cell apoptosis. MCPs produced by enzymatic degradation of pectasol, induced apoptosis in prostate cancer cells and increased the doubling time of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in patients undergoing various treatments used to treat prostate cancer. Enzymatically hydrolyzed citrus pectin has also been shown to have clinical benefits, improved quality of life, and reduced pain in patients with advanced tumors in various types of cancer19.

Pectins can be degraded to pectic oligosaccharides (POS) by various degradation methods such as enzymatic hydrolysis, acid hydrolysis, hydrothermal processing, high-pressure microfluidization, or photochemical reaction in TiO 2 -containing medium10,20. Enzymatic methods have significant advantages over other methods, such as: (1) the reaction is performed under mild operating conditions, (2) the hydrolysis medium does not cause corrosion, (3) no toxic or contaminating chemicals are used (4) hydrolysis is selective and affects only specific constituent units or bonds, as expected for an enzyme-catalyzed reaction; (5) reaction efficiency may be higher than that achievable by, chemical methods and (6) the formation of unwanted products is avoided21. Pectinolytic enzymes are classified into two main groups: (a) esterases including pectin methyl esterase, and (b) depolymerase including hydrolase and lyase22. Many fungal species can break down pectin by producing different pectinolytic enzymes. Studies have shown that Alternaria sesami produces pectinolytic enzymes including polygalacturonase transeliminases, pectin transeliminases, and polygalacturonases23. Elrod reported for the first time that the Erwinia bacterium could degrade pectin23. Zucker et al.24 and Chatterjee et al.25 demonstrated the production of induced and extracellular endopolygalacturonase by Pseudomonas fluorescens and Erwinia.

Alcaligenes faecalis as a member of Alcaligenaceae from Betaproteobacteria class has many applications in biotechnology and food and health industries. Alcaligenes spp. has been used in the production of plastic-like storage material, enzymes, polysaccharides, and also commercial production of amino acids as food additives26.

As a member of Paenibacillaceae from the Bacilli class, Paenibacillus polymyxa is involved in a variety range of physiological and biotechnological processes. Different strains of this bacteria can be used in nitrogen fixation, antibiotics production, and phosphorus solubilization in the soil. P. polymyxa is known to produce cell wall degrading enzymes with hydrolytic pathways. Different strains of P. polymyxa were reported to produce exopolysaccharides (EPS) which as a secondary metabolite have a wide range of applications in bioindustries27.

In the current study A. faecalis, AGS3 and P. polymyxa S4 were isolated and identified. The objective of this study was to investigate microbial degradation of pectin by pectinase of isolated bacterial isolates A. faecalis AGS3 and P. polymyxa S4 and for the first time identify products and then investigate the anticancer and antioxidative properties of obtained compounds.",Investigation of bioactivity of unsaturated oligo‑galacturonic acids produced from apple waste by Alcaligenes faecalis AGS3 and Paenibacillus polymyxa S4 Pectinases

Recycled newspaper has traditionally been the main ingredient of so-called molded pulp packaging products, which have become increasingly popular because they are compostable. But the supply of recycled newspaper is in decline, creating a market for substitute materials.

Yanyun Zhao, an Oregon State professor who leads a research team focusing on sustainable food packaging and processing, has studied apple pomace and other byproducts from processing fruit and vegetable juice and winemaking as an alternative for recycled newspaper in molded pulp manufacturing. She and the team received a patent for this research.

“Right now, apple pomace is typically just composted or used for animal feed,” said Zhao, whose research aims to reduce food loss and waste across the food supply chain. “We thought why not turn it into an environmentally friendly product that meets an industry need.”

Zhao envisions apple pomace being the main ingredient for molded pulp packing products such as take-out containers, flower pots, beverage cartons and bottles and clamshell packaging used for fruits and vegetables.

She is focused on apple pomace, in part, because it is readily available in the Pacific Northwest. When apples are processed for juice about 70-75% of the apple goes into the juice, leaving the remaining 25-30% as pomace.

One of the key problems to solve in creating pomace and paper-based packaging is improving water resistance so that it could withstand high moisture, liquid food or non-food items and products stored under high humidity conditions.

In a just-published paper in Food and Bioproducts Processing, the team sought to create eco-friendly, bio-based, compostable and cost-effective solutions that would improve the hydrophobicity, or water resistance, of the apple pomace-based molded pulp products.

They used two strategies: incorporating polymers and compounds with characteristics to improve water resistance into the pulp formulation and applying superhydrophobic coatings on the product surface. The polymers and compounds studied include lignin, chitosan and glycerol.

Lignin is a polymer that forms key structural materials in the support tissues of most plants. Rhubarb pomace, which is particularly lignin rich, was used in this study.

Chitosan is a bio-based polymer commonly used in the papermaking industry. A previous study from Zhao’s team found that chitosan reduced water absorption of cellulose nanofiber (CNF) films significantly through adsorption of chitosan onto CNF fibers via hydrogen bonds.

Finally, glycerol is an organic compound often added to a material to make it softer and more flexible. Previous studies had shown that at low levels glycerol decreased water absorption.

The researchers determined the optimal amounts of those polymers and compounds while also adding a small amount of cardboard fiber for stability of the molded pulp packaging products.

Zhao’s team has a long history of studying food coatings as a barrier to water and gases. The team had previously created a two-step preparation of superhydrophobic coating that is heat, cold and water resistant. They applied a simplified, one-step coating on the surface of the apple pomace-based product to enhance water resistance.

They concluded that the study demonstrated the feasibility of using fruit pomace as a new source of fiber in producing molded pulp packaging and effective approaches to enhancing water resistance in those packaging materials.

Co-authors of the paper are Clara Lang, Jooyeoun Jung and Taoran Wang, all of whom are former or current members of the Sustainable Food Packaging and Processing team in the Department of Food Science and Technology in Oregon State’s College of Agricultural Sciences.

The research was supported by the Oregon Department of Agriculture Specialty Crop Block Grant Program. Kerr Concentrates, Inc. of Salem and Hood River Juice Company of Hood River provided fruit pomace for the research.",Oregon State researchers makes key advance in turning apple waste into packaging material

Updated Friday, July 15: The update includes the proposed bi-monthly fee for the commonly-used 95-gallon barrel for residential customers.

The town of Apple Valley has announced a proposed rate increase for Burrtec Waste Industries services.

The town’s involvement with Burrtec includes billing customers directly for the waste services provided under the franchise agreement.

The proposed fee increase would help Burrtec recover from the rising cost of service caused mainly by inflation and the implementation of commercial food/green waste recycling required under state law, town officials said.

Burrtec offers rate structure fees for solid waste services, which include residential, multi-family, and commercial.

If adopted, the new bi-monthly fee for the commonly-used 95-gallon barrel for residential customers would increase from $59.04 to $72.74, a difference of $13.70.

The 60-gallon barrel would go from $53.56 to $67.54, an increase of $13.98, and the 40-gallon type, from $50.76 to $64.92, an increase of $14.16.

Proposed fee increases for commercial trash bin service are based on the size of the bin and the frequency of service/pick-ups.

For a one day pickup, a 1.5 size commercial bin would increase from $69.19 to $71.89, 2.0 size $91.56 to $95.17, 3.0 size $136.26 to $141.63 and a 4.0 size bin $181.09 to $188.24.

Some of the additional proposed fee increases would affect commercial barrels, commercial compactor trash services, recycling commercial bin services, and food waste bins.

To view the full list of proposed rate increases, visit applevalley.org/services/solid-waste-trash.

Proposition 218 protest

The proposed rate increases will be adopted and go into effect on Sept. 1 unless written protests against increases are presented by a majority of property owners (50% +1).

Town officials said they are conducting a Proposition 218 majority protest proceeding out of an abundance of caution and without conceding the applicability of the proposition to the franchise agreement.

The Town has scheduled a public hearing at 6:30 p.m. on August 23 for Burrtec/town staff to make a presentation regarding the proposed increases and for citizens to offer comments.

To submit written comments, email the town clerk at publiccomment@applevalley.org by noon on Aug. 23 and indicate whether you want your comments read aloud or forwarded to the council.

The meeting will be conducted inside council chambers at Apple Valley Town Hall, 14955 Dale Evans Parkway.

The full agenda and meeting can also be viewed online at AppleValley.org, on Frontier Channel 29, or Charter Spectrum Channel 186.

Apple Valley residents speak out

Several residents contacted the Daily Press regarding the proposed increases, including James Simon, who called the possible action by Burrtec “a sign of the times.”

“With the rising price of fuel, everything has or is going up,” said the 52-year-old Simon. “Burrtec, Southern California Edison, Southwest Gas and other utility companies are probably taking a hit so I can understand them wanting to raise prices.”

Simmons, who also has a home in Pomona, said his bi-monthly residential rate for waste pick-up is about $67 for a standard waste barrel.

“There are many retired and disabled citizens residing in Apple Valley who live on fixed incomes and are already suffering under the burden of the highly inflated gasoline prices,” Rick Van Stralen told the Daily Press.

Van Stralen added that fuel costs are already passed along on every product that is purchased and inflation is “already hurting us terribly. This proposed rate increase only creates more pain.”

“We are required under the Apple Valley Municipal code to subscribe to Burrtec’s service, so we are forced to accept whatever rate the Town Council decides to force upon us,” Van Stralen said.

He also added that between the “high cost of water through Liberty Utilities” and now the proposed increases in trash service, along with inflation, they have to choose between paying for certain costs or bills.

Although it’s stood the test of time, it becomes harder each season due to the effects of climate change.

“It’s like Las Vegas in the dirt,” said Sharon Soons.

Sharon is the daughter of Art Soons, who converted the former dairy farm into a full-time orchard and helps with its day-to-day operation.

What You Need To Know Soons Orchard, an orchard of more than 55 apple trees, has been in existence for more than 100 years



Much of its peach and apple harvest fell victim to a frost on April 18



The USDA estimated 2021 apple production for New York totaled 1.3 billion pounds

Every year, they gamble with whatever hand Mother Nature gives them, and this year it’s a fight with climate change. Inconsistent temperatures that plagued them during the early months set back this year’s harvest.

“The weather is completely unpredictable these days, which is exactly what happened to the apples and peaches,” said Soons.

She can pinpoint the exact night it happened.

“We got hit in April with a night that went all the way down to 26,” said Soons.

After a week that peaked in the 80s, a late season frost on April 18 caused many of the buds on peach and apple trees to die.

“That’s the whole thing with this climate change stuff; it’s just so unpredictable,” said Soons.

Soons Orchard consists of over 55 different types of apples that guests can pick from any fall day. The USDA estimated 2021 apple production for New York State totaled 1.3 billion pounds, down four percent from 2020. Soons Orchard hosts thousands of visitors every fall, to pick apples and enjoy their market.

With a small harvest expected this fall, it’s left the historic apple orchard considering the unthinkable.

“My father wants us to buy apples … because we don’t have enough apples to sell,” said Soons.

Soons can consider herself a part-time meteorologist, considering how frequently she checks the weather radars.

“It’s supposed to be 86 today; that’s good,” said Soons as she checks the weather for another day.

For the time being, the farm is good, but she hopes temperatures level out sooner rather than later.

“We just want a little balance,” exclaims Soons.",New York apple orchards feeling effects of climate change

Local farmers blame the unpredictable weather for it. Dipak Hirachan has been in the apple farming business for the last 20 years, and he says the fruit production has dropped massively over this period.

“There is a massive difference both in terms of the apple’s quantity and quality.” Hirachan owns apple orchards in Tukuche village. It is an area where rainfall rarely occurred until a couple of years ago. Mustang’s dry weather is one reason why apples from there, though tiny in size, are sweet and why people love them. But the region has been receiving excessive amounts of rain in recent years. As a result, apple farmers are facing problems of pest infestation and plant root decomposition due to excessive moisture in soil.

It is extremely difficult to grow apples in lower Mustang these days.

“There is a serious pest problem here, but we have no way to combat them. This is a direct result of climate change in these mountain areas,” says Bikal Sherchan, an apple farmer in Kuwang village.

Experts say the overall crop output of Mustang has been hit due to changing climate.

Achyut Tiwari of Central Department of Botany, Tribhuvan University, says a study conducted in Mustang shows that apple production in Mustang has dropped sharply as a result of excessive rainfall.

“Many farmers in the so-called apple region of the district such as Lete, Taklung, Dhampu, and Kowang are moving towards different crops.”

Tiwari adds some places in the upper region of Mustang, where apple production was hard until a couple of years back, meanwhile, are seeing improved production. “This is because these areas haven’t been receiving as much snowfall as they used to. Apples and other crops that prefer dry climates are moving further up because of changing weather patterns.”

Prakash Bastakoti, chief of Agriculture Knowledge Center, Mustang, says the effects of climate change can be observed particularly in lower altitude regions of the district, but there hasn’t been many conclusive and comprehensive studies.

“The use of pesticide has also increased significantly because the apple farmers have been witnessing various crop diseases.” There are around 3,700 households in Mustang and nearly 1,500 of them are involved in apple farming. Of late, some of these households have been migrating to upper Mustang, where they can grow apples without fears of rainfall or pests.

Subas Adhikari, an environment expert, bemoans the fact that the government doesn’t have strong data to measure the effects of climate change and to prepare a robust action plan. “There have been a few studies but they are not enough. Climate change research should be a matter of priority for all three tiers of government.”",Climate change hits apple output in Mustang

From health monitoring to the option of listening to audiobooks, an Apple Watch comes with plenty of features. Apart from the beneficial features, it also offers a lot of customisation options related to its look. Users can choose a variety of watch faces to decorate their Apple Watch as per their mood. When the Apple Watch first debuted in 2014, there were just 10 standard faces. However, since then, the variety has considerably increased and the number has reached as many as 31 groups. Among all the faces Apple offers, there is a stellar one named the Astronomy watch face. Along with the date and time, the face enables the view of our solar system.

Though the Astronomy watch face was first launched with the first-generation Apple Watch, it has seen some major updates with the release of watchOS 9 and the Apple Watch Series 8 simultaneously. Though all of the latest watchOS 9 watch faces are interactive in some fashion, the Astronomy watch face includes a particularly unique feature that offers the visualisation of the solar system. As space has always been a curious topic, Apple Watch owners have found the look quite exciting.

The Astronomy watch face’s default image of Earth includes a live cloud map that shows where you are right now. Also, you have the opportunity of watching the Moon or the Solar System when you modify the watch face from the customisation page. To explore this hidden feature, you are required to activate Solar System views.

After saving the Solar System view as your watch face, you will be able to track the other planets too. You just need to turn the digital crown in any direction which will allow you to observe the alignment of all eight planets in their orbits with the sun at their centre. If you want to see how the planets’ orbits were aligned in the past or in the future, you can scroll forward or backwards several years.","Astronomy watch face on Apple Watch enables exciting view of Solar System; check features here- Technology News, Firstpost"

Chris Williams, the head of 1Komma5 in the Asia Pacific – and also of Natural Solar, 1Komma5’s first purchase in Australia – said the company plans to spend $100 million as part of an aggressive expansion strategy in the next six months to become the biggest independent solar group in the country.

“The Australia group [of the global 1Komma5 conglomerate] will be the biggest solar company in the country by revenue within the next few months,” Williams told RenewEconomy.

“Part of that will be through the growth of Natural Solar and Solaray, and we are continuing to acquire other businesses around the country.

The European’s first Australian acquisition was Williams’ company Natural Solar in October, Australia’s largest installer of solar batteries, and both are part of an ambitious 80-deals-in-18-months strategy. To date, 1Komma5 has caught 25 companies in Europe and Australia in its widening net.

“All of the acquisitions across the world have grown, have increased profitability, increased revenue, now they are part of a much, much bigger machine,” Williams said. “This is on the back of greater global procurement, better access to supply, and better control and understanding and industry expertise that comes with it.”

Solaray Energy, which launched in 2010, is Australia’s largest installer of Enphase micro inverters and also specialises in Tesla battery solutions to go with rooftop solar arrays. It told a majority stake to 1Komma5 for an undisclosed sum.

Williams expects both Australia companies to benefit from a deepening relationship between Enphase and the global HQ of 1Komma5, which last year pledged to expand each others’ geographic footprints, the former for its inverters in Europe and the latter for the use of its virtual power plant technology.

1Komma5 launched in 2021, and raised more than €200 million in a Series A financing round backed by eCapital, BTOV Ventures, Porsche Ventures, French Eurazeo, Blue Elephant Ventures and the Haniel and Schuerfeld families.

It launched with a goal to sweep up last-mile cleantech companies around the world and, using its market power, drive down prices for consumers and drive up revenues for itself through better supply chain control and better buying power.

Williams says the global company is on track for 30,000 installations this year and plans to double that.

“No other groups have that volume. The key point here is that, again going back to the global procurement scale here and a current run rate of 30,000 installations, it has moved the needle. The 1Komma5 relationship is very important to manufacturers.”

The acquisition spree is also a way to roll out 1Komma5’s in-house Heartbeat home energy management system as well as offer customers across its subsidiaries a way to connect their various devices.

The system creates a mini virtual private power plant at home by connecting batteries, heat pumps and air conditioners, electric vehicle chargers, smart meters and other devices, and manages the buying and selling of electricity from and to the grid.

Jonathan Fisk said he and Peter Thorne co-founded Solaray Energy in 2010 after many years in the IT industry, and had installed almost 100,000 Enphase microinverters and more than 1,000 Tesla Powerwall batteries.

“From day one, we’ve chosen to only install the very best products. It’s this advanced technology that will have the greatest impact in saving the world from a climate catastrophe,” he said in a statement..",German start-up plans “Apple-like” solar stores as it snaps up Australian solar companies

BHeart unveiled its solar and human activity-powered BHeart smart band at CES 2023 in Las Vegas. It caught my eye because it attaches to virtually any classic watch using what's known as 'lugs' – basically the pins that connect a typical watch band to the watch body. The band, which comes in silver and gold, is attractive enough, but it's also packed with technology.

In addition to activity and health-tracking sensors on the inside of the band, including a Photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor for measuring heart rate, this may be the first fully self-powered smart watch band. On the outside of the band are five square solar panels, which work in tandem with a heat receptor to collect energy for the tiny 1mAh battery.

That's apparently all the energy the band needs to track the aforementioned heart rate, activity, steps, and sleep score.

Without a smartwatch screen, BHeart won't be delivering notifications, texts, news, and emails, but that's clearly not the intention. One of the things BHeart measures is your 'outdoor time' which, naturally, it gathers through the solar panel's exposure to the sun.

At CES, executives quipped to me that you ""recharge yourself while recharging it.""

There does seem to be a bit of a trend here at CES to leave screens behind, without losing the benefit of the information the technology behind them can collect and analyze. BHeart does have an app that would allow me to see all these health and activity points, and which suggests new habits to improve these scores. But without a screen, you're not faced with these data points on a continuous basis.

For me, the band could be an opportunity to reignite my love of the analog timepiece. I have so many beautiful watches gathering dust in drawers while I stare at my Apple Watch, reacting to every notification and news alert. I kind of miss my old life of showing off an oddball watch face like my Beethoven watch, on which his piano-playing hands are also the hour and minute hands, or my exquisite, ultra-thin 18k gold Longines watch.

I also like the idea of a watch that rewards me for my daily walks. Of course, my Apple Watch tracks and measures all my exercise and activity, but I need to tell it, or acknowledge on the screen that I am in fact doing a walking workout. BHeart's more frictionless approach would constantly credit me for my fresh-air time with both energy for the tracker and that nifty outdoor score.

There are limits to this BHeart reverie, though. There's no leather option, and the design is a bit workmanlike for some of my more elegant watches. It's also not shipping yet. BHeart representatives told me they expect to ship in the US and Europe by the end of this year, with the band costing anywhere from $100 to $249.

That's a lot to pay for a watch band, but not so much for a fitness and wellness tracker that can enhance and rejuvenate your favorite old-school watch – and maybe you, as well.

First up was Larry Culp, chief executive of US industrial giant GE who has the task of preparing the newly-created GE Vernova energy business for a spin-off next year. A huge challenge in that ambition is turning around the onshore wind arm of the former GE Renewable Energy unit, which as a whole lost more than $2bn last year.

Also in the news was Christian Bruch, the chairman of Siemens Gamesa and CEO of Siemens Energy, which is currently taking full control of the wind power OEM. Bruch did not mince his words as he flagged the perils facing a European wind industry that he claimed is in “a critical situation”.

Today (Friday) brought the turn of Henrik Andersen, Vestas' CEO, who spelled out the challenging year facing the Danish wind OEM after a tough set of 2022 results, described as a mixed bag of news by analysts who took comfort in predictions of a healthy 2024 in the US wind market.

New York’s growing status as a global offshore wind hotspot was underlined this week as a string of domestic and international big names lined up to bid into the US state’s latest 4.6GW Round 3 procurement.

The likes of Orsted, Equinor with partner BP, RWE, along with US offshore first-timer Invenergy are among those with their hats in the ring for the round.

The outcome could see OEM giant GE build two new plants in the state to build the latest ‘redesigned’ version of its Haliade-X turbine that escapes the ban on US sales incurred after a patent court defeat to rival Siemens Gamesa.

News of the potential industrial investment was timely, given warnings this week of a risk to Joe Biden’s 30GW by 2030 offshore wind ambition from a lack of coastal and port infrastructure.

Masdar, Abu Dhabi’s renewable energy champion, is set to find itself in the global spotlight as never before later this year when the United Arab Emirates hosts the COP28 UN climate summit.

Recharge this week took an in-depth look at Masdar’s 100GW ambitions in the light of the controversy swirling around its chairman Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber, the CEO of oil group Adnoc who will also be the summit’s president.","Wind CEOs weather storm, Big Apple rides offshore wave and Masdar in spotlight"

Video Transcript

SEANA SMITH: Apple turning positive-- look at that-- here afterhours. Revenue coming in better than expected, up 8% year over year, 90.15 billion. iPhone revenue coming in just a bit light, 42.63 billion. The Street was looking for 42.67 billion, so just missing Wall Street's expectations. Here to break down the report, we want to bring in Ivan Feinseth at the Tigress Financial Partners chief investment officer. So Ivan, when you take a look at the after-hours action, we've been bouncing around just a bit. We were off 4%. Now we're back in negative territory, off just around a 1/2 of a percent. What's your initial reaction to this report?

IVAN FEINSETH: It was a great quarter. I mean, yes, it missed slightly in some areas, but one, I mean, the macro environment is tough. So to do the job they've done in this quarter is very good. And FX has been a significant headwind. And unfortunately, sometimes, foreign exchange is a headwind. Sometimes it's a tailwind. It's been a massive tailwind.

But most importantly, the iPhone 14 was only available to ship in the last week of the quarter. And they could have shipped more, but they also faced supply chain constraints. So they are not able to build the number that they need to. So the demand is strong. And the slight misses in this environment, I think, makes it an incredible quarter. And I think any weakness is a major buying opportunity.

DAVE BRIGGS: So all the concerns over waning i14 demand issues, you think much ado about nothing when you look at this report?

IVAN FEINSETH: Absolutely. I mean, they really-- they missed by less than a percentage point in most areas. So it was just so small. And given in this environment, it's a phenomenal job. And the demand is there and key, while the services revenue, again, slightly weaker. It's about growing the ecosystem and expanding the services base.

Story continues

And they also just announced a services increase for Apple TV, the Apple+ bundle, Apple Music, and several of those services by $1 to $2 a month, which, based on their massive user base, is a significant amount of money. Not that insignificant to the consumer, but certainly very significant in the aggregate for Apple, which kicks in next quarter. So there's a lot of wind at their back.

SEANA SMITH: Yeah, Ivan, I wanted to ask you a little bit more about that bump up in price, what that would mean for Apple in the current quarter. Well, I guess more so looking out to 2023. You mentioned it will boost their revenue. I guess by how much is the question. What are you forecasting?

IVAN FEINSETH: I don't have the number. So they have, I think, 800 million active users. And so by $1 or $2 a month, you multiply that out, and that's a lot of money. I mean, it's-- let's say it's a billion dollars, another billion dollars a month of-- remember that this incremental price increase is mostly profit. I mean, I'm sure costs have increased. And certainly, in the case of Apple TV, the cost to produce content has gone up. And the need to pay people more has gone up.

But the incremental increase to revenue is much more significant than the incremental increase in costs. So it is a net positive. And they still offer a great value. And Apple has a very loyal customer base. And they are still a long way into a massive upgrade cycle. There are a lot of people with iPhone-- I know people with iPhone 8s. But certainly there are a lot of people with older iPhones that will be one to two years into their contract that will be eligible to upgrade next year. So this upgrade cycle is pretty powerful.

And the other important thing to remember that demand is strongest for the more expensive phones. So consumers want the Pro and the Plus and the more expensive phones because consumers are willing to pay up for phones, for smartphones, and for the service because it's such an integral part of people's personal and professional lives.

DAVE BRIGGS: Yeah, the demand all on the Pro side. Another question coming in was the impact of the China COVID lockdowns. Ivan, what are we seeing there? Are you able to take away anything from that?

IVAN FEINSETH: Well, they did report strong China results, but China has been under-- they have this zero-COVID policy. They have locked down right away. And it has been disruptive to companies that do business in China, as well as China's own economy. But eventually hope the COVID issues will subside, and then the economy there will pick up. So I think Apple is in a great position. The stock has been down. And I think it's a buying opportunity here. And I always say any weakness in Apple is a buying opportunity. And history has shown that to be the case.

DAVE BRIGGS: Yeah, no guidance since 2020. So what are your biggest lingering questions for the call?

IVAN FEINSETH: Well, I think the most interesting thing, especially with what's gone on with Meta Platforms, is that the anticipation of an introduction of a virtual reality headset from Apple and what that looks like and how that integrates also into their services revenue, because they already have a operating system for their virtual headsets that has been launched and has-- they also launched tools for developers to start to make content for that.

So we have a whole other wave that is very fascinating of additional potential sale of hardware and software and services. So there's still a lot of exciting things ahead. And the fact that the wearables market continues to grow with the new launch of the Apple Watch, the Apple Ultra Watch, and the new AirPods. Again, there's a huge upgrade cycle for that. And that is already proving out.

DAVE BRIGGS: So, overall, Ivan, it's been a gloom and doom story in tech-- no secret there. But what does this report tell you about the environment as a whole, the macro environment and the headwinds?

IVAN FEINSETH: It still exists. It's a tough environment, but yet Apple, I think, is enduring pretty well. So to have these just tiny shortfalls from expectations that are almost insignificant is a major positive.

DAVE BRIGGS: Chalk it up for another W for Mr. Cook. Ivan Feinseth, good to have you, sir. Thank you.","Apple earnings: 'There's a lot of wind at their backs,' analyst says"

So, Kelsey Farish got a notification on her Apple Watch that warned her of a ‘loud environment’ around her. The message even read that staying in the environment for more than 30 minutes can bring permanent damage to one’s hearing abilities.

Little did the watch know that the source of the loud noise was Kelsey’s toddler son, Hugo! In the tweet, Kelsey shared a picture of the notification she got on her Apple watch as little Hugo was seen crying in the background. “Thanks for the push notification, Siri - that’s exactly what I needed at that moment,” she wrote in the caption.

A customer looks at products made of apple leather at the Yurakucho Marui department store in Chiyoda Ward, Tokyo.

Faux leather is nothing new, but leather made from apple waste has been drawing the attention of both companies and consumers.

Frequently referred to as apple leather, the material has been used in various commercial products overseas as a result of people becoming more environmentally conscious, as well as U.N.’s sustainable development goals. Progress has also been made in Japan to develop the material commercially.

Bags and wallets made of Italian apple leather were on display at a recent sales event at the Yurakucho Marui department store in Chiyoda Ward, Tokyo.

“It’s indistinguishable from real leather,” said university student Taiga Matsumoto, 20, who came to the event. “If the functionality and design are the same, I’d choose the one that is more eco-friendly.”

The products were created by bag and accessory company Lovst Tokyo.

“If you use faux leather made from plants, there will be less livestock production, leading to less carbon dioxide emissions,” said Kaito Karasawa, 31, president of the Tokyo-based company. “Many people choose [these products] as a way to help the environment.”

Apple leather is considered an ethical product as it is manufactured with the environment and people in mind. The products have recently been drawing attention as there is more interest in climate and human rights issues.

As the plant-based leather is made from dried apple cores and pomace that have been crushed and mixed with resin and other materials, it leads to less food waste. Apple leather is light and can stretch, and the texture is very similar to animal leather.

In recent years, progress is being made to commercialize apple leather products in Japan as well.

Nagano-based startup Sorena has been jointly developing apple leather with the town of Iizuna, Nagano Prefecture, and Kyowa Leather Cloth Co. in Shizuoka Prefecture, naming the material Ringo Leather (apple leather).

Iizuna purchases pomace from various locations, including local breweries. The pomace is then dried and crushed at a municipal facility.

“Since we’re aiming to become Japan’s No. 1 apple town, making full use of the apples and not leaving any waste sounds very attractive,” said an official of the town’s industries and tourism department.

Sorena is also partnering with craftsmen and domestic brands to manufacture various items on a trial basis using apple leather. Toward the end of last year, the company started taking preorders for discounted Ringo Leather wallets on the crowdfunding site Makuake. Sorena is planning to start selling apple leather bags and business card holders on its official website in April.

“I’d like to help apple leather-related industries take root in Nagano to revitalize local communities,” said Sorena President Yuri Ito, 38.

Aomori-based startup Appcycle, Inc. has developed Ringo-Tex, a fabric made from apples produced in Aomori Prefecture. All Nippon Airways Co. selected the Ringo-Tex fabric to make its headrest covers for a sustainability-themed flight in October. Appcycle is currently developing other products for the average consumer and is planning to put them on sale this year.

“I’d like to make Appcycle into a company that can support apple farmers in Aomori [Prefecture],” said Appecycle COO Kei Fujimaki, 38, who is an Aomori Prefecture native.

In other countries, cacti and mushrooms have been used to make faux leather, which have been used by major brands, such as Hermes and Adidas.

“As consumers and investors are becoming more conscious of environmental issues, more companies will begin manufacturing eco-friendly products,” said Takeshi Okuwaki, a researcher at Dai-Ichi Life Research Institute Inc. “I think it will spread to daily necessities as well.”",Japan Companies Turn to Apple Waste to Make Eco-Friendly Leather

(Reuters) - Apple Inc said Wednesday that it will build a battery-based renewable energy storage facility in Central California near a solar energy installation that already provides energy for all of its facilities in the state.

Apple said the project will store 240 megawatt-hours of energy, or enough to power more than 7,000 homes for one day. It is located next to the California Flats solar installation in southeastern Monterey County, about 100 miles southeast of Apple’s Cupertino, California headquarters.

The site sends 130-megawatts of electricity directly to Apple’s California facilities during daylight hours but does not provide power during dark hours. Lisa Jackson, Apple’s vice president of environment, policy and social initiatives, told Reuters in an interview the company intends to develop what it believes will be one of the largest battery-based storage systems in the United States.

“The challenge with clean energy - solar and wind - is that it’s by definition intermittent,” Jackson told Reuters. “If we can do it, and we can show that it works for us, it takes away the concerns about intermittency and it helps the grid in terms of stabilization. It’s something that can be imitated or built upon by other companies.”

Jackson said that Apple plans to share its findings from building the project with other companies, but said it was too early to say precisely how it would do so. Apple has other projects where it has shared environmental technology developments, including an aluminum smelting joint venture in Canada and an Apple recycling technology lab in Texas.

Apple on Wednesday also said that 110 of its suppliers are now moving to using clean energy for the work they do for Apple, with about 8 gigawatts of clean energy production planned as a result, or what Apple said was the equivalent of removing 3.4 million cars from the road. The figure is an increase from last year when Apple said 70 of its suppliers had made the transition to clean energy for Apple work when it set a goal to eliminate carbon emissions from its supply chain by 2030.",Apple to build battery-based solar energy storage project in California

""We passed all of these beautiful trees and I said, Oh my God! Look at all of the beautiful apple trees and look at all of those apples,"" said Chad Techner with Metro Food Rescue.

Metro Food Rescue, a non-profit based in Oakland County, launched in March of 2020. Volunteers with the organization travel throughout metro Detroit saving food from restaurants, pantries and local warehouses that would otherwise go to waste.

Once they collect the food, they bring it to food pantries and local missions for those most in need.

After contacting Oakland County, the non-profit spent the day picking apples from a field near the Oakland County Farmers Market. They say the apple trees have likely gone unharvested for several years. They called the event The Great Apple Rescue.

""We basically started Metro Food Rescue with the knowledge that 40% of the food gets wasted in this country and in the same point one in four kids doesn’t know where their next meal is coming from, nationally. Here in Oakland county, it’s one in every six kids,"" said Techner.

The apples picked Sunday will be made into jams and butters by local businesses. Then they will be sold and the profits will be given back to local food pantries. Some apples will also go to food pantries and given directly to metro Detroit families battling food insecurity.

""Even if it's just apples, these apples are going to go a long way,"" said Shane Sperling as he pulled apples.

Sperling works with Yad Ezra, a Jewish food pantry in Berkeley.

Sperling says food insecurity can be especially tricky for people with diet restrictions.

""There’s a lot of people who need food and things of that nature from a food pantry and they just don't know how to find it and a lot of times because we are kosher, that is a unique food need,"" said Sperling.

Halfway through the apple picking event, volunteers had several bags full of apples with many more to collect. Metro Food Rescue says they're on track to save nearly two million pounds of food in the metro Detroit area this year.

""It's relaxing but I also know I'm doing good for the community so it's nice,"" said volunteer Isabelle Dechen.

Volunteers say it will likely take them a few days to pick all of the usable apples.

This comes after an in-person meeting by the VentureFruitTM team and their Hot Climate Programme (HCP) partners, Plant & Food Research, Institute of Agrifood Research and Technology (IRTA) and Fruit Futur, who welcomed new and existing testing partners from around the world to the IRTA Fruit Centre in Lleida, Spain last month.





Global COVID related travel restrictions have meant that this was the first opportunity since 2019 to meet in person, discuss the challenges growers are experiencing and how HCP varieties offer a solution to these challenges.

Attendees from 13 countries and more than 35 fresh produce companies gave a strong validation of the global focus and demand for resilient pipfruit (apple and pear) varieties, as the sector recognises the need for fruit varieties that can adapt to climate change conditions.

Varieties evaluated were those closest to commercialisation opportunity – advanced selections that have both grower benefits through harvest dates, improved pack outs of marketable fruit, reduction in waste and harvest costs and consumer expectations of a consistently great eating experience.

HCP Evaluation Process

The process is a two-fold approach involving consideration of both grower needs and consumer preferences. For growers it’s assessing the new varietals for superior hot climate performance and resilience (in comparison to traditional varietals), ensuring the trees produce high quality fruit to meet production, supply and market requirements.

For consumers it’s satisfying expectations at point of purchase as well as the eating experience, ensuring the fruit has consistency in appearance, taste and texture. Across both apples and pears, suitable varieties are continuing to be identified and added to the development pipeline.

“VentureFruit invests extensively in consumer research in key markets globally to understand consumers perception of sensory attributes relative to benchmarks, to explore product and brand positioning and to inform future breeding objectives. By doing this we optimise the value proposition of each variety and of the programme as a whole”, says Kate James, Business Development Manager, VentureFruit.

Fruit Logistica in Berlin under BayWa Global Produce umbrella

As part of BayWa Global Produce, T&G and VentureFruitTM will be jointly exhibiting with BayWa Obst (Germany), TFC Holland (Netherlands), ENZAFRUIT Continent (Belgium) and Worldwide Fruit (UK) at Fruit Logistica in Berlin. They will be the joint stand in Hall 27, C-13.

We might soon have a 14.1-inch version of the super-powerful slate, alongside the standard 11- and 12.9-inch versions we've seen in the past.

That sounds great for entertainment and work, but there's one unavoidable issue with a behemoth like that, and that's that the size exacerbates any unaddressed issues found in the smaller tabs.

Case in point: the aspect ratio of the iPad Pro (2021) suits the uses of the tablet, but if Apple scales that up to 14 inches, they might very well be wasting space with the extra pixels.

Tablet aspect ratio

Most iPad screens have a 4:3 aspect ratio in landscape mode. Generally, an aspect ratio like that means that for every 4 inches of width, there is 3 in height. 1:1, for example, would be square. Compared to other tablets on the market, iPads are relatively squarish, at 4:3.

For context, smartphones hover around 18:9 to 21:9 (height to width); and in the tablet world, many designs, including Samsung's Galaxy Tab S8 and Amazon's Fire HD, stick to an aspect ratio of 16:10. That makes them much wider than iPads when laid landscape.

This kind of aspect ratio can be great for a range of functions: it makes it easier to split-screen the device and see 2 documents side-by-side, without them being weirdly stretched. Maybe more importantly for some, the 16:10 aspect ratio means you don't have the huge bars at the top and bottom when you watch movies, which typically have very wide aspect ratios.

iPad Pro-blem

The iPad Pro is useful for many reasons, but its aspect ratio is a key sticking point. For the reasons we've previously discussed, it's hard to easily multitask on an iPad Pro. Furthermore, when you watch a movie, the actual video only showcases on less than half the screen area – thanks to the aspect ratio and those aforementioned giant black bars.

A 14-inch iPad would purportedly give you more viewing area, but if Apple sticks with the 4:3 aspect ratio, we'd still have the same issues – just in a slightly different size. You'd still have gigantic black bars above and below your movie, and the actual increase in viewing size would be minimal, at best.

(Image credit: Future)

There's one additional problem, and it has to do with cases and stands. When we tested the Samsung Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra with its 14.6-inch screen and even wider 16:10 aspect ratio, we felt like it was always at risk of falling over.

A giant 14.1-inch slate with a 4:3 aspect ratio would be really tall, even when held landscape. As a result, it might need a super-strong Magic Keyboard magnet to hold it, or an incredibly strong Keyboard Folio to ensure it doesn't fall over when reclined because of its own weight and, well, gravity.

Make a wide iPad

The solution for these issues is easy: Apple should make a tablet with a wider aspect ratio.

The company is no stranger to this type of screen ratio: its MacBook Pros have 16:10 displays, and also come in 14-inch sizes. What a coincidence.

This would, of course, require some tweaks to iPadOS to make Apple's tablet software fit – at the moment, we expect that to be an easy job since all iPads have the same ratio. But with Android 13 bringing some serious upgrades to Android tablets, we've got our fingers crossed that Apple's engineers are pulling out all the stops to upgrade iPadOS in a big way.

Apple would also need to adjust the dimensions for its keyboard and case accessories, beyond simply increasing their size.

But Apple can't expect consumers to gobble up a wobbly iPad with loads of wasted screen space, so it would behoove them to put in the extra development time.",Apple's super-sized iPad Pro will be a waste of screen space without one small tweak

Five drivers working for Uber and Lyft told Insider about car features that make the job better.

This included Apple CarPlay, chargers for passengers, and plastic screens between the seats.

One driver said heated seats in his Cadillac were also a winning feature for passengers.

Drivers working for ride-hailing apps pick up a wide variety of passengers who have all sorts of preferences.

Uber drivers need to be attentive, focused, and dedicated to ensuring their riders reach their destination safely. It can also be tiring work. Uber updated its guidelines in 2018 so that drivers get a notification to take a six-hour break after up to 12 hours of driving.

Given how much time they spend in their cars, many drivers rely on specific features, gadgets, and apps to make the job easier.

Insider spoke to five drivers who work for Uber and Lyft about what accessories they — and their passengers — like the most about their vehicles. Their identities and occupations have been verified by Insider.

An Uber spokesperson told Insider their drivers aim to give riders ""the best possible experience"" on a daily basis.

""Furthermore, with our broad range of services — from Uber Comfort to Uber Pet — riders have more choice than ever to ride in the style they choose,"" they added.

Lyft didn't immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.

One Uber driver in San Francisco said his passengers love using the in-car phone charger.

Michael Eide said he has a car charger that hooked onto the back of the front seat's headrest so passengers can charge their devices during the ride.

The one he uses cost $30 and has three retractable charging wires that are compatible with Apple and Android devices. The driver plugs the charger into the vehicle's USB port.

""My passengers love it,"" said Eide, who drives a Toyota Prius.

For many reasons, it's important to Uber and Lyft drivers that a passenger has an enjoyable ride. And when guests are happy and comfortable, it can improve their drivers' average rating. Passengers can give up to five stars to drivers.

Plastic dividers that separate the passengers from the driver ""set the tone"" for the ride, according to another driver.

Mike Hosley, who drives for both Uber and Lyft in southern California, told Insider he was pleased when a plastic screen was installed in his Cadillac during the pandemic. It separates the front of the car from the back of the car, where the passengers sit.

""I've actually turned around and had a dog's nose there before. I've had people leaning over and breathing on me, and people sneeze,"" he said.

Hosley, 62, said the plastic dividers ""set the tone"" between the passenger and the driver because he didn't like riders getting in the front and invading his space, especially after the pandemic hit.

Apple CarPlay, which is integrated into the Uber app, makes driving easier for Trevor Martin, a driver in Orange County, California.

Martin, who has driven for Uber for more than a year and has completed more than 1,000 trips, said having a car with access to Apple CarPlay was ideal.

The feature became available in February to Uber drivers in the US, according to TechCrunch.

Uber drivers who have an iPhone can use the Uber app directly through their vehicle's dashboard via Apple's CarPlay. This means drivers can organize trips, get directions, and communicate with the rider more easily on a bigger screen, compared with solely relying on their phone, which is usually mounted to the dashboard.

Being able to play a large variety of music is appealing, not only for drivers but also for passengers.

Richard Knupp, an Uber and Lyft driver who drives in State College, Pennsylvania, said he switches between alternative rock, pop music, and old classics during rides. He likes tuning into SiriusXM too, he added.

""The music choice makes my experience more enjoyable,"" Knupp told Insider. ""I get bored with repetition and like to choose genres according to my mood.""

Passengers also appreciate the music as some ask whether they can connect their phone to the car's Bluetooth or aux cable so they can play their own tunes, Knupp said.

Eide, who drives in San Francisco, said he listens to Spotify or audiobooks to ""help pass the time.""

One Uber driver in Florida said he couldn't drive without air conditioning.

John Lacy is a Florida-based Uber driver who has completed more than 900 trips over eight years.

""My AC is always on!"" he told Insider. ""Was close to 90 today and it just gets hotter from here.""

Last summer, a heatwave settled over many parts of the US. The extreme temperatures caused some schools to close, created power outages, and put more than 100 million people in the US under a heat alert, Insider previously reported.

Drivers from delivery companies such as UPS reported heat as high as 150 degrees in their vehicles without air conditioning. They said it was making their jobs more difficult.

On the other hand, passengers love the heated seats.

Hosley, an Uber and Lyft driver in southern California, said his vehicle has heated seats in the back. Passengers can control the settings with a console.

""The feature that was the most popular with women was hands-down the heated seats in the back,"" Hosley said. ""They loved it.""

Passengers have told him how much they appreciate the feature, especially when the weather is cold, he added.

Apple has announced a $200 million investment fund designed to remove carbon emissions from the atmosphere and support sustainable forestry — and to generate financial returns for the company.

Called the Restore Fund, the effort aims to remove 1 million metric tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere each year, equivalent to the fuel used by more than 200,000 passenger cars annually. The project could also act as an important model for other corporations by demonstrating the ability to profit from investments in the environment.

“The idea of having a return is important for the planet,” Apple’s vice president for Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives Lisa Jackson said in an interview with CNN’s Christine Romans that aired Friday.

“Because if you really want businesses to engage, if you want business to really turn around and do this at scale … it has to be because there’s a return on that investment,” Jackson said. “Otherwise, it’s just philanthropy. And so much of what we’re doing at Apple is showing that the business of doing right by the planet is good business.”

An investment in sustainable forestry

The Restore Fund will generate returns by investing in developing and conserving sustainable “working forests” that both remove carbon from the atmosphere as they grow, and also produce trees for building materials, paper and other uses. Apple’s packaging, for example, has since 2017 been made entirely of virgin wood fiber from “responsibly managed working forests” — the same kinds it plans to invest in through the fund.

Apple (AAPL) established the fund alongside Goldman Sachs (GS), which will manage it, and the nonprofit Conservation International, a co-investor that will ensure the projects it funds are subject to “strict environmental and societal standards.”

“Those are renewable products if the forest is grown in a way that it’s sustained,” Jackson said. “What we’re really saying with the Restore fund is: here is a way for us to invest in doing forestry the right way. That supports the planet, it supports returns and it supports communities, these people who work in the forestry industry.”

The Restore Fund builds on Apple’s previous commitments aimed at fighting climate change.

Since 2018, the company has said its retail stores, data centers and corporate offices all run on 100% clean energy. The company is also changing the materials with which it builds products to more environmentally friendly options. And by 2030, Apple says it will make its global corporate footprint entirely carbon neutral, including its supply chain, manufacturing processes and products.

All of those changes are being made, Jackson said, not just because the nearly $2.3 trillion corporation wants to give back to the earth, but also because they’re good for business.

“All of those things were done with an eye toward return,” she said. “The truth of the matter is that clean energy is cheaper, and cleaner. And so if we can show companies that this is good for business, then you’re not having to choose between your bottom line and doing well by the planet.”

Apple as ‘a force to advance’ equality

The news of Apple’s latest sustainability effort also comes at a time when many corporations are engaging on a number of other progressive topics, including voting rights and the prospect of raising corporate taxes.

Executives from more than 100 companies, including fellow big tech giants Facebook (FB), Twitter (TWTR), Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN), issued a public statement earlier this month opposing any measures that deny eligible voters the right to cast ballots. The statement followed legislation in Georgia, Texas and other states where Republican lawmakers are trying to clamp down on ballot access.

Apple was not among the statement’s signatories. But on Monday, Will Smith and Antoine Fuqua announced that production of their film “Emancipation,” which was sold to Apple Studios, would leave Georgia over the state’s restrictive voting law, a decision Jackson said the company supports.

“The right to be in a democracy is a sacred civil right … we want to see every single person have the right to vote,” Jackson said. “Companies like ours, we stand for action on climate change. We also have taken a strong stand that there are still inequities, systemic injustices, that are tied to race around education and criminal justice and economic opportunity. And we want Apple to be a force to advance those causes and to finally end these inequities.”

Jackson deflected on the question of whether Apple supports raising corporate taxes, which has been posited as a way to help pay for the Biden Administration’s ambitious infrastructure package and which has received support from leaders at Amazon (AMZN) and BlackRock.

“I think that the economy can find a way to make the investments that it needs,” she said, adding, “I’m not going to speak to specifics at this point.”

However, she did say that the infrastructure plan, which would involve investment in high-tech manufacturing, clean energy and transportation systems designed for electric vehicles, would be good for the country and for Corporate America.

“There’s so many good ideas that are part of the technology and the economy we need for the future so we can stay the cutting edge country that we’ve always been,” Jackson said. “I do think that investments in infrastructure have always been seen as an investment in the future and quite good for business, so we need to come together as a country and figure that out.”",Apple’s $200 million fund aims to fight climate change and boost business

The Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor claims that companies exaggerated climate pledges.

Amazon and Google were rated low in integrity and transparency.

Apple and Walmart displayed reasonable levels of transparency.

Researchers recommend a more standardized approach for climate change pledge disclosures.

A report released Monday claims companies that made ambitious public pledges to fight climate change are exaggerating their goals and lacking transparency.

The report, called Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor, looks at 25 high-revenue global companies who have made climate change mitigation pledges across a range of sectors and countries. It scores each company with a measure of their transparency and integrity levels, based on a five-point scale for each (high, reasonable, medium, low, very low).

Among the consumer-facing companies that scored low for transparency and integrity were Amazon and Google, while companies like Walmart and Apple displayed reasonable levels of transparency, according to the report.

The report looks at the ways companies tackle scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions. Scope 1 covers direct emissions from owned or controlled sources. Scope 2 covers indirect emissions from the generation of purchased electricity, steam, heating and cooling consumed by the reporting company. Scope 3 includes all other indirect emissions that occur in a company's value chain.

Many of the companies have met or are on track to eliminate scope 1 and scope 2 emissions but have not created a comprehensive plan to get rid of scope 3 emissions, which accounts for the vast majority of emissions by those companies.

""I must admit that we were quite shocked about the extent of creativity that some companies apply to claim a credible path to net-zero emissions, and the amount of effort that it takes to reveal that,"" says Sybrig Smit, a climate policy analyst and co-author of the report. ""Net-zero pledges and similar targets are not what they may seem. They require detailed evaluation; in the majority of cases, they cannot be taken at face value.""

Companies underreporting emissions: Tech companies like Google, IBM are underreporting their greenhouse gas emissions, study finds

The researchers recommended a better approach for companies to reveal whether or not they are meeting climate change targets that demand more transparency.

""There is currently no standardized approach for information disclosure on climate targets and actions; it required significant resources from us, the analysts, to understand what companies are really committing to, and to identify key details that sometimes significantly undermined these commitments,"" Smit says.

Google scores low for transparency and integrity

Google's major emission sources come from product manufacturing and use and electricity consumption in data centers.

While the report authors call Google's decarbonization efforts ""comprehensive and innovative,"" they criticize Google's reliance on controversial carbon offsetting programs, which involve offsetting pollution by removing carbon elsewhere via land restoration or tree planting. The report also alleges that Google did not make it clear whether its plans are sufficient to address scope 3 emissions, which represent the majority of Google’s greenhouse gas emission footprint.

Google did not immediately respond to USA TODAY requests for comment.

Apple scores reasonable for transparency, moderate for integrity

Apple, in contrast, scored reasonable in transparency and moderate in integrity. It's set a goal to achieve carbon neutrality across its entire business by 2030, and average yearly emissions reductions have shown that Apple is on target to meet this goal, the report says.

Apple's 2020 claim that it is carbon-neutral only applies to its scope 1 and scope 2 emissions, which only account for 1.5% of the company’s greenhouse gas footprint, the report says. The other 98.5% that Apple has yet to eliminate comes from goods and services for product manufacturing, AKA its scope 3 emissions.

Apple did not immediately respond to USA TODAY requests for comment.

Walmart scores reasonable for transparency, low for integrity

Walmart has set reasonable goals to reduce its operational emissions to zero by 2040, with interim goals in 2025 and 2030.

However, most of its emissions come from scope 3 emissions, and Walmart has not set any emissions reduction target, relying on engagement from suppliers to voluntarily reduce emissions themselves, the report alleges.

Walmart responded to USA TODAY saying it is indeed addressing scope 3 emissions.

“This report does not accurately characterize Walmart’s climate goals and actions, and the authors did not provide an opportunity to provide corrections. Walmart is on track to meet science-based goals for scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions reductions set in 2016,"" says Jane Ewing, senior vice president of sustainability at Walmart.

Ewing also mentioned that Walmart's employees are working with suppliers on avoiding a gigaton (1 billion metric tons) of greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and pointed to public disclosure records that indicate how Walmart is planning to reduce scope 3 emissions.

Amazon scores low for transparency, integrity

Amazon's ecological footprint comes from a variety of sources, given its involvement with both logistics within e-commerce and data centers for its cloud computing technology.

The company made a net-zero carbon pledge for 2040, but the report alleges that this is unsubstantiated and doesn't have enough clarity.

Amazon disputes the report, telling USA TODAY, ""Amazon regularly reports our carbon footprint. Our own carbon footprint reporting is publicly available.""

Amazon also points out that it plans on powering its operations with 100% renewable energy by 2025 and deploying 100,000 electric delivery vehicles by 2030.

The report raises questions such as whether their pledge refers to just carbon dioxide emissions or all greenhouse gases and whether Amazon plans to reach their its goal using carbon offsets over nature-based solutions.

An Amazon spokesperson expressed support for nature-based solutions such as conservation, restoration and improved land management actions, pointing to Amazon's LEAF Coalition, a public-private global initiative to raise at least $1 billion to protect the world’s tropical rainforests.

However, the reason behind its low ratings, according to the report, is its lack of granularity in its data.

Jonathan Stempel at Reuters reports further:

“According to a complaint filed in San Francisco federal court, Apple “coerces” consumers who use its smartphones, smart watches and tablets into using its own wallet for contactless payments, unlike makers of Android-based devices that let consumers choose wallets such as Google Pay and Samsung Pay.”

As Mercator has covered in the past, including my latest overview of the digital wallet space in June, Apple operates in a closed garden environment, restricting access to their wallet technology and NFC (Near Field Communication) chips. In contrast, Android devices operate in an open environment, allowing for multiple digital wallets to access the NFC chips within phones using the Android OS and with no direct costs back to either Google or the phone manufacturer. Apple currently charges 15 basis points on credit card transactions and half a cent on debit card transactions processed through Apple Pay resulting in them collecting more than $1 Billion in fees according to the lawsuit.

The plaintiff, Affinity Credit Union of Iowa, argues that Apple’s approach not only harms financial institutions, but also harms consumers utilizing the digital wallet by not allowing for personal choice that could result in using a product consumers feel is superior in either security or functionality.

“Apple’s conduct minimizes the incentive for the Cupertino, California-based company to make Apple Pay work better and make it more resistant to security breaches. ‘Apple’s conduct harms not only issuers, but also consumers and competition as a whole,’ the complaint said.”

The lawsuit follows similar actions in Europe where regulators also argue that Apple’s digital wallet does not provide a competitive environment. Affinity is seeking class action status in its complaint.

Easing the transition to Apple Silicon

“The M1 chip provides many benefits, but to take advantage of them today, developers need to be able to seamlessly switch between Apple Silicon and Intel-based build options,” Bitrise CEO Barnabas Birmacher said.

The company, whose customers include N26, Transferwise (now “Wise”), Virgin Mobile, Tag Heuer, Mozilla, Paysafe, and Philips Hue, sought to provide developers with that kind of flexibility while also providing a scalable solution built on the company’s own iOS CI/CD technology.

“As a result, teams can concentrate on expanding capabilities, instead of manual setup and troubleshooting that can result in a drop of release frequency. For the sophisticated mobile product organizations building on Bitrise today, a delayed feature or fix can cost millions of dollars,” he said.

The introduction reflects a reality in which millions of Apple Silicon Macs are already being deployed across the enterprise, which means the need to port apps from Intel to M-series processors is also growing.

What is Bitrise offering and who is it for?

The cloud-based solution was developed in collaboration with more than 100 companies and is designed to meet the needs of sophisticated development projects. It’s a managed solution that doesn’t require the purchase of physical hardware.

Birmacher said the product is aimed at “anyone who is developing on iOS — so, every iOS developer and development team. Apple is completely phasing out Intel-based machines and the entire Intel-based development environment, so everyone developing for iOS will have no choice but to move to Apple silicon.”

If you use Bitrise, you can enter the virtualized Apple silicon environment in Bitrise’s Workflow Editor under the Stacks & Machines tab. The M1 Elite XL machine will be available for use there.

The environment features several layers of automation, including an Insights tool that lets teams monitor app performance to identify weaknesses. It allows developers to build, test, and deploy app updates to the app store faster than any other solution on the market.

“This launch of a fully virtualized Apple silicon environment built for iOS CI/CD is the first one available, reinforcing our commitment to get these kinds of capabilities into the hands of our customers faster than anyone else,” Birmacher said.

“Before using Bitrise’s Apple Silicon compute option, we were struggling with our M1 builds since our third-party libraries do not support Apple Silicon yet,” Radoslov Radenkov, engineer at Paysafe, said in a statement. “We have been able to transition and increased the speed of our builds by 50%. We have also decreased testing times from one hour to 22 minutes.”

What about WWDC?

To some degree, M1 Macs are already on the way to being superseded following Apple’s introduction of the first M2 Macs earlier this week.

“The new M2 chip is even more efficient than M1 and features exciting capabilities,” Birmacher said.""However, Apple didn’t announce a M2 Mac mini with larger memory (to be racked in the data center like M1 Mac minis). Since a 16GB memory isn’t great at handling larger apps, M2 will struggle to be a viable option for many iOS teams. Even M2’s 24GB memory isn’t quite enough.”

Like most developers I’ve been in contact with since the show, Birmarcher was optimistic overall, saying:

“Apple pairing immediately available developer APIs with the many new iOS 16 features and functionalities stands out…. Developers will be able to quickly support the newly announced features.” He also saw the introduction of real-time widgets, the opening of HomeKit, and improvements to CarPlay as big opportunities for app developers.

Apple also introduced interesting changes in device management and declarative device management for Macs at the event, which I'll have more on tomorrow.

One rooftop array installed on a workshop in 2018 is now complemented by a larger 79-kW array atop a barn recently added to the property. All Energy Solar, a full-service solar energy solution provider, designed and installed the systems to provide clean energy on-site at the family owned and operated orchard located in Hastings, Minnesota.

Nestled in the Saint Croix River Valley on about 250 acres, Afton Apple produces Minnesota-grown crops beyond apples, including raspberries, pumpkins and more. The grounds are a seasonal destination for family-friendly activities like pick-your-own produce, a corn maze, a playground and a petting farm. The retail store sells cider, pies, jams and other items, in addition to pre-picked fruits and vegetables.

“The Femling Family and staff at Afton Apple Orchard have always embraced sustainability, the concept of giving back, and doing good by the community. Supporting their property with solar not only helps Afton Apple significantly reduce their energy consumption from the grid, but also showcases their environmental commitment to thousands of visitors each year, ” said Michael Thalhimer, director of business development at All Energy Solar. “This project was important to the Femlings; we’re thrilled to support the business and its mission to reduce its dependence on fossil fuel energy.”

The array will power most of the electricity needs supporting the orchard’s retail store, machinery, lighting, refrigeration and outbuildings.

“Interest in our solar project was originally driven by my husband, Frank, who always believed in renewables and looked for ways to make our operation more efficient, to save on costs,” said Cindy Femling, owner of Afton Apple. “Frank’s legacy was to set up the orchard for success for our kids, and completing this solar project has been a big part of that effort.”

The solar installation supports Afton Apple’s commitment to minimizing the orchard’s environmental footprint while growing high-quality produce to keep the farm economically viable.

While the trees seem to do all the work producing our favorite fall fruit, their sweet flavor can become impacted by changes in weather and climate.

What You Need To Know Although apples are hardy, big temperature extremes can be detrimental to orchard crops, as can severe storm elements



Above-average rainfall can cause both good and bad impacts on apples



Somewhat dry weather yields smaller and sweeter tasting apples



Environmental impacts like climate change, wildfire smoke and pollution are a challenge for farmers

According to the University of Illinois Extension, Washington takes the pie with nearly 50% of apple orchards in our country. New York is the second-biggest grower, followed by Michigan, Pennsylvania, California and Virginia.

Apples are grown in dozens of states, and it's a fruit crop that can keep its residence through many generations.

So what type of weather takes the sauce when it comes to growing apples?

Cold temperature impacts

Let's start with temperatures, shall we? Cool weather is something apple crops can tolerate, but when temperatures fall near or below freezing, it can damage the fruit.

Extreme cold can lead to a smaller crop, leaving farmers to rely on hardier, more limited fruits that survive the snap. Even though apples might survive a cold snap of more than four hours below freezing, they could weaken enough to shorten their shelf life.

Advection freeze and radiation freeze are two types of events that apple farmers are on the lookout for.

An advection freeze hits when a dry, cold air mass hits and conditions are windy throughout the night and early morning, radiating away any heat held within the plant and soil surrounding it.

A radiation freeze happens when a layer of cold, dry air forms beneath a layer of warm air on a clear, calm night, and if the plant turns colder than the air, it can suffer damage.

Frost can also be a big-time killer, especially if it's a hard frost. While frost is a threat to apple health at any time, if it hits early in the season, it may be more difficult to recover than a later frost.

A spring frost can kill tender apple blossoms out of the gate, whereas a late frost can weaken mature apples. Mid-to-late season frost can slow the fruit-growing processes.

Frost that hits during apple growth can cause russeting that forms rusty brown splotches on the skin. While these blemishes may not impact the flavor of the apple, the defective fruit is put into a bin to be processed into juice, cider or sauce.

This is why farmers pay close attention to local weather forecasts and gauge what times they may need to apply frost protection methods such as covers, wind machines, heaters and water applications.

Although apple crops can grow nearly in any hardiness zone, apples tend to thrive in climates where it's cold in the winter, moderate in the summer and has medium to high humidity rather than a hot and dry climate.

While it is possible to grow apples in warmer climates, apples grow best in regions where the temperature rarely increases above 90 degrees.

You see, apple trees tend to prefer some chill hours in which the temperature is in the 40s. This is why the northern states tend to have a larger variety of apples than southern states.

Warm temperature impacts

Apples hold the reputation of a robust autumn fruit crop that can withstand a wide range of temperature fluctuations, but some more extreme weather swings can alter that sweet flavor.

So, let's get to the meat of it. After all, this is the magical time of the year when there's nothing better than biting into a fresh orchard apple; but your apple could taste different from year to year based on weather and climate conditions?

Here's what I learned. Warmer-than-normal temperatures can cause an early bloom that leads to changes in apple firmness and acid concentration levels. Too much heat and sun can actually ""sunburn"" apples! Excessive heat can alter an apple's color, leaving it pink or brown instead of red.

A softer fruit may result from a high number of heating degree days. Rather than crisp and juicy, the apple may take on a mushy or mealy texture.

Other weather impacts

Strong storms with damaging wind can knock off apples or take out trees altogether. Hail is an enemy to apple growers as it can shear off fresh blossoms or create divots in mature apples, leaving them too damaged to sell.

Ice, snow and heatwaves can be detrimental to the apple.

A rainier season sometimes brings larger apples, and these apples are best for juicing and cooking. Excess rainfall can cause apples to grow into a softer texture that is more prone to bruising. Too much moisture during and after apple maturation can lead to molding, which can kill entire crops.

Smaller apples from a drier season can be a good choice for snacking on if you prefer a sweeter taste. The small apples in drier seasons contain less water content leading to a tastier flavor.

What's your favorite flavor?

Apple varieties naturally run the gamut from sweet to tart, so what flavor are you attracted to?

If you want to take a bite out of a sweeter apple, go for a Honey Crisp, Gala, Fuji or Golden Delicious. These apple species are considered high in natural sugars and have a popping flavor when they are fresh in season.

Are you a tart apple kind of person? If so, then you may prefer Granny Smith, Northern Spy, and Braeburn.

There are a plethora of other apple types and some new hybrid breeds that may be worth checking out next time you are at the store or local farm market.

Climate change means more work for farmers

Apple crops are not only sensitive to everyday weather conditions, but they endure and attempt to adapt to changes in solar radiation, air pollution and carbon dioxide levels.

According to the USDA, changes in climate, like warming, can cause lower growth rates, smaller yields and diminished fruit quality.

Here's a study on climate change and how it's continually monitored for impacts on apples and other fruit crops, courtesy of Scientific Reports in the UK.

Extreme weather and out-of-whack seasonal temperatures tend to lead to more defects in the fruit, and it forces adjustments to the timing for harvest seasons.

New ways of farming and relocation might become the norm in the future for farmers to keep their crops going.

To remedy years of drought, farmers will need to install new irrigation systems. As a preventative flood measure, there is a need for updated drainage lines for excessive rainfall events.

Cool days and crisp nights are welcome in apple orchards across our country, but weather extremes are not.

Apple growers tend to look forward to the harvest season when apple-friendly temperatures not only benefit the flavors but draw in the apple-picking crowds. Farmers can also move their produce.

Also, cooler weather means more of us will begin to spend time cooking and baking apple-based products for our families!",Getting to the core of apple flavors

As well as making Apple completely carbon neutral by 2030, Lisa also runs the racial equity and justice initiative to improve lives - and has created major opportunities in Apple’s Community Education Program. But is it all too much for one person?

""We have a team of very wonderful people,"" Lisa laughs. ""We actually keep a pretty small team because we really believe a lot of the work has to be the work of the people all over Apple, so when we work on environmental improvements like in our hardware, we just announced this past Earth Day that we're up to twenty per cent recycled content in our devices. That didn't happen because of my team, that happened because of the product engineering In teams and the materials teams, we work closely with them to help them push the boundaries of what's possible.

WATCH: Lisa Jackson talks Apple's 2030 goal

""So, I always tell people, it's my honour to lead it but there are people all over Apple who are motivated and inspired by their work.""

As one of the biggest companies in the world, Apple’s leaders are well aware of the importance their contribution has to the vital protection of the planet.

""We're already carbon neutral and I think that is a huge accomplishment for a company that touches both hardware and software data centres,"" Lisa explains. ""But now it's the 2030 goal. We challenged ourselves and the company to come up with the most aggressive goal to bring our supply chain and our products to 100% carbon neutral and it’s 2030 - when we first came up with the number we were like, 'We’re crazy!' But there’s a history of being crazy at Apple!

""The other thing we challenge ourselves on is the kind of innovation that people expect in our products we want them to see that in our environment work. So the 2030 goal is based on a lot of innovation that we're driving inside the company and even outside the company. So it feels very true to who we are as a company.""

Lisa admits that the climate crisis is a concern for her on a personal level - but that this should motivate people to action. ""Concern can do one of two things, right?"" She asks. ""It can paralyse you in place or it can motivate you to action and in this case leadership. It's a source of pride for employees that Apple that we're taking our innovation and applying it to probably the biggest crisis that the planet as a whole faces.

""It motivates everyone like, 'I have to do something,' and because of who Apple is, we are such we make tools to help individuals do what they want to do. So we're also very cognizant that you have to work at almost a community level person by person.""

She continued: ""The number one thing anyone can do is the be part of the recycling economy. It's a big part of our products, the whole trade-in program, the idea of recycled material use and getting our products back so we can get that material back into the circular economy.""

You can recycle any Apple device within the store, which is the best way of disposing of your device as vital items from devices can be recycled. Lisa explained: ""There're recycling options. So first is part of the natural part of making you a choice for the next device so you can trade in or bring in your device and the wonderful thing about that is if you have access and can do it in person, we can make sure it's wiped, that your data is no longer on it that from a privacy and security standpoint. That's always a huge priority for us.

""But if you can't we can send you the instructions to make sure you do it yourself and you can mail it back to Apple. In Europe you have access to some recycling programs, so there're a bunch of options, but we prefer to come back to us because all generations of iPhone, I think we're up to 23 different models can go through [our systems] so we can find a way to get those materials back.""

Early snowfalls in Kashmir, where almost 80% of India’s apples are grown, have seen the region’s farmers lose half their crops in the third year of disastrous harvests.

Officials are trying to calculate the loss to the apple industry, which contributes almost a third – 50bn rupees (£500m) – to the local economy annually. The apples are sold in fruit markets across India and some are exported.

Researchers have warned that orchards in the Kashmir valley, which is ringed by the Greater Himalayas and the Pir Panjal mountains, are likely to become unsustainable in the next few years, as the climate crisis affects production.

The last 20 years have seen gradual changes in weather patterns in the region, which have intensified in the past five years. This is the third year harvests have been affected by early and heavier snowfalls in the Kashmir valley.

According to Kashmir’s department of horticulture, 5bn rupees were lost from harvests in 2018. This rose to 22.5bn rupees in 2019, which saw the heaviest snowfall Kashmir has experienced in 60 years.

“In the light of the changing climate, apple harvesting is not sustainable [here],” said Dr Irfan Rashid, assistant professor at the University of Kashmir.

“Usually, Kashmir receives the snowfall after 15 December, but over the last two decades, we are experiencing early snowfalls. The harvest time for many apple varieties is November. In the last five years, we have had three erratic snowfalls and in the future the situation may exacerbate.”

He added: “Climate models forecast a very grim scenario as far as erratic weather is concerned. The Himalayas, which includes this region, is going to receive more frequent extreme events as we progress through the century. It is very normal that Kashmir will be witnessing extreme weather events.”

In response to the crisis, officials at Kashmir’s department of horticulture have been encouraging farmers to plant new “high-density” imported varieties, which are harvested earlier than existing crops. The government has been promoting subsidy schemes to help farmers buy and market the new varieties and wants to increase the amount of land used for growing.

Ajaz Ahmad Bhat, director general of the horticultural department, said: “We cannot stop what is coming. The only way out we have is conversion to high-density varieties.”

Research published this year suggested new varieties could generate significant economic returns and outweigh the initial high outlay.

Rashid said the government strategy could help mitigate the impact of erratic snowfalls, but added it would result in the loss of local varieties.

“Already, the local varieties like ambri are shrinking,” he said.

Farmers have been reluctant to embrace new varieties, pointing to disappointing results from pilot projects.

“Shifting to high-density varieties is not easy for us,” said Nawaz Ahmad Thoker, a farmer from Ramnagri, a sleepy village surrounded by orchards in Jammu and Kashmir state. “We will have to uproot the existing orchard and then plant the new saplings, which will incur us huge costs.”

Thoker, whose family has tended their seven-acre (2.8-hectare) orchard for 35 years, broke down when he surveyed the damage to his crops after heavy snowfall at the end of October. Trunks of half the trees were split and branches still with their fruit attached were buried under six inches of snow.

He estimated he had lost 100,000 rupees (£1,000), which will mean a difficult year for him and his family, as he struggles to pay for his children’s school and parents’ healthcare.

“It was not only the year’s harvest lost in front of my eyes, but the three-decades of hard work by me and my family, destroyed,” he said.

About 70% of his apple trees were damaged by early snow in 2018 and 2019.

“I am thinking of doing some other work, maybe start a business so that my children have a good future,” said Thoker. “It seems our next generation will not be able to see these apple orchards.”",India’s apple farmers count cost of climate crisis as snow decimates crops

This means that you're looking at a pile of iPhones weighing 250,000 metric tons (the Empire State Building weighs in at roughly 330,000 metric tons), and if laid end-to-end would circle the Earth more than five times.

I found those numbers so hard to believe that I've had to check them several times.

Now again, they're not all iPhones (according to Cook, a billion are iPhones), and some are Macs and iPads, so this is a conservative estimate.

Doing some back-of-the-envelope scribblings, and it's easy to see this ecosystem topping the weight of the Empire State Building.

Now, if we imagine that Apple stopped selling hardware today, we can conservatively estimate that in 8 years, about 80 percent of this hardware will be obsolete and will need to be collected, processed, and recycled.

That's some 200,000 metric tons.

But Apple hasn't stopped making things. If anything, the ecosystem is growing rapidly. This time last year, Apple boasted it had 1.4 billion active devices in the wild, with 900 million of those being iPhones.

Then there's all those accessories. If Apple abandons the Lightning port as it is predicted to do, that move alone would result in an incredible amount of e-waste.

Apple is not alone in being responsible for creating this legacy -- every company that makes a thing needs to have a plan for what happens to said thing when it has come to the end of its life -- but the rate at which Apple is making hardware, combined with how fast its ecosystem is growing, means that over the coming years there will be an enormous volume of Apple-branded hardware that will need dealing with.

I'd like to see Apple publish figures on hardware recycling, outlining how much materials are recovered. This, in turn, would spur other companies to follow suit.

Lete and Kobang in Mustang district, once famous for apples and products made of apple, such as dried apples, apple jam, and brandy (Marpha), among others, no longer grow apples.

Locals, who had depended on apple farming in both localities situated at around 2,500 metres above sea level, have been left with no other option than to seek alternative to apple farming.

Much to the astonishment of locals, until a decade and half ago, apples used to be grown commercially on land up to 3,000 metres above the sea level.

These days, apples are cultivated in the highland above that elevation.

In Lete and Kobang, fruits like pears, walnut and apricot were put in place as an alternative to apple farming, informed Agriculture Knowledge Centre, Mustang Chief Prakash Bastakoti. He said that apple was grown in Lomanthang (3,800 metres) and its surrounding areas lately.

Locals said apple farming was flourishing in Muktinath and Chusang areas in the district known for producing fragrant, juicy and crispy apples. Proprietor of Hotel Grand Sambala in Muktinatha, Suraj Gurung, said more and more farmers in those areas were fascinated by commercial apple farming of late.

Residents in the high hills said they could see a change in rainfall pattern these days. The settlement here would see rainfall rarely in the past, but this rainfall is not an occasional phenomenon for them. With the start of rainfall here, age-old structures made of clay are at risk of collapse. People residing around the Nilgiri Peak in Mustang said the area would not see rainfall annually, but now the pattern has changed and it has been frequent, weakening the clay-made structures.

Settlements on the lap of the Nilgiri are facing the consequences of the change in rainfall pattern.

Lupra, Marpha, Jomsom, Chhairu, Thini and Thyang feature traditional houses with clay roof tiles. It seems such roof tiles are not enough to resist rainfall as they are gradually crumbling with rainfall becoming frequent.

Such structures are made for special purposes to challenge the chilling cold in the high alpine settlement. They work as indigenous air-conditioning system to keep houses warm and protect people from the consequences of biting cold. They still remember using shovels to clear off the snow from their roof.

Climate in the high lands is almost all the time cold and houses with clay roof keep them less affected. Locals said they saw challenges in keeping the indigenous architecture intact. The scale of incidents of rainfall-caused disasters has gone up while changing climate system has its direct impact on agriculture production.

Bayer makes substantial progress in accelerating development of biologicals through collaborations with Ginkgo Bioworks, Kimitec and M2i

Innovative varieties of fruits and vegetables can help develop more sustainable and regenerative food systems and increase access to essential nutrients

BERLIN, GERMANY / ACCESSWIRE / March 23, 2023 / - At this year's Fruit Logistica taking place in Berlin from February 8-10 Bayer highlights its solutions towards regenerative agriculture (Bayer booth: hall 1.2, stand C23), meaning the balance between productivity outcomes and environmental protection, while supporting the needs of society and farmers. Key to regenerative agriculture is partnering with players along the whole food chain. ""The pressure on food systems is rising each year. To nutritiously feed a growing world population while protecting the planet's boundaries, we need to produce more food with less resources and develop solutions that can cope with climate change,"" said Inci Dannenberg, President of Global Vegetable Seeds at Bayer's Crop Science Division. ""The challenges are so big and multi-faceted that they can only be addressed if we join forces.""

Biologicals innovation with tremendous environmental and business potential

One pillar in that collaborative approach towards regenerative agriculture is Bayer's advancement in Biologicals, in other words agricultural inputs that are derived from biological instead of synthetic processing. The company has recently entered multiple promising collaborations in that space which will be showcased at Bayer's booth at Fruit Logistica.

Bayer just lately entered a strategic partnership with Spanish biologicals company Kimitec focusing on accelerating the development and commercialization of biological crop protection products, as well as biostimulants to promote plant growth. Bayer also entered a partnership with French company M2i Group to supply fruit and vegetable growers around the world with pheromone-based biological crop protection products. In 2022, Ginkgo Bioworks became a multi-year strategic partner with Bayer to develop biological solutions in areas such as nitrogen optimization, carbon sequestration, and next generation crop protection.

Story continues

Driving the development of biologicals is promising as it addresses environmental and business potential likewise. While it reduces the impact on the environment the biologicals market is expected to grow to nearly €25 billion by 2028.1

Advancing sustainability and access to essential nutrients through seed innovation and food chain partnerships

The world is not only facing food insecurity, the need for a more sustainable and regenerative food system, and climate issues but also a nutrition gap. Bayer, through its Vegetables by Bayer business along with its Seminis® and De Ruiter® brands, has been developing various innovative solutions to address these challenges. Examples that are highlighted at Fruit Logistica include Strabena tomato with excellent attachment to vine and improved shelf life reducing the need for plastic packaging, Orange Candy® melon with good field holding and longer shelf life helping to reduce losses, or the Huntington sweet pepper which is a climate resilient variety. Bayer will also present its comprehensive offering to fight the tomato virus (ToBRFV), one of the biggest challenges for growers. This includes the De Ruiter® varieties with Intermediate Resistance2 to ToBRFV, such as Strabini, already growing commercially in many glasshouses and the two new varieties Ferreira and Novero recently launched in North America and Mexico.

To enable access to essential vitamins and minerals, particularly in underserved communities, Bayer, through The Nutrient Gap Initiative, also engages in direct intervention, education and advocacy. Originally an initiative by Bayer's Consumer Health division, Bayer's Crop Science division will also be part of it from 2023 onwards adding the importance of access to essential nutrients from fruits and vegetables.

Another example of how Bayer is contributing to food security and nutrition supply through engaging with partners along the food value chain is the company's effort to curb the spread of Tropical Race 4 (TR4). This disease threats the existence of the banana as it is known. It causes a lethal wilt in banana plants and an infested plantation will lose its entire production for that year, and potentially several years more. Bayer has engaged with the Global Alliance Against TR4 and, through a module of its BayG.A.P. program, has trained hundreds of banana farmers on prevention against TR4. BayG.A.P. is a service program which supports and educates farmers worldwide to get certified and connected to the food value chain.

FRANKFURT, Feb 27 (Reuters) - Bayer (BAYGn.DE) has appointed Jeff Ubben to the drugmaker's independent sustainability council, in a sign that the activist investor will be given a say at the embattled group.

The Germany company said in a statement on Monday that Ubben would be one of three new entrants to the nine-member council, which meets with members of Bayer's management board twice a year.

Bayer's shares have been weighed down by litigation over its Roundup weedkiller and by its diversified structure, drawing investors' criticism.

On Feb. 8, Bayer said it would replace its CEO early after a selection process that began in mid-2022, recruiting the former head of Roche's (ROG.S) pharmaceuticals business, Bill Anderson.

Days before the announcement on the CEO changeover, sources told Reuters that Ubben, who runs investment fund Inclusive Capital, had contacted fellow investors to drum up support for big changes at Bayer, including the swift replacement of outgoing CEO Werner Baumann.

Ubben, who holds a 0.83% stake in Bayer, said he was excited about the company’s research and development strengths.

""Bayer’s Crop Science division holds great potential to minimise the need for further deforestation by increasing the current arable land’s productivity,"" Ubben said in Bayer's statement.

A source familiar with the matter has told Reuters that Ubben welcomed Anderson as Bayer's choice of new CEO.

While it was not clear whether Ubben would also seek a supervisory board seat, he was quoted by the Financial Times on Sunday as saying that such a move and the sustainability role USwere not “mutually exclusive”.

A Bayer spokesperson declined to comment further. Ubben could not be immediately reached outside of U.S. business hours.

The other two new members of the sustainability council are former Rwandan health minister Agnes Binagwaho and Dante Pesce, the former chair of the United Nations working group on business and human rights.

Summary

In September 2015, the United Nations (UN) adopted “Agenda 2030,” setting a total of 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). to generate solutions to overcome global challenges such as poverty, hunger, health care, gender equality, climate change and numerous others.

Following our vision Health for All, Hunger for None, we are working on meeting challenges like climate change, food security, environmental impact reduction, and our main objectives - biodiversity and nature preservation – this is the lens through which we prioritize and identify stakeholders across our value chain.

How we inform our strategy

Bayer is a member of several multi-stakeholder platforms to develop collaborative new solutions to become an impact generator. Each platform has various committees and working groups that develop content (white papers, roadmaps, joint commitments, etc.) providing a space for science-based discussions and opportunities to advance new solutions. Involvement in these working groups and committees also provides valuable insight for the entire Bayer organization on trends, needs and expectations of other stakeholders, including consumers, NGOs, etc.



At the working group/committee level, a cross-functional team of subject matter experts (SMEs) represent Bayer during meetings, sharing Bayer perspective and facilitating input/review from our contributors on content creation. The leadership team drives their representation by providing strategic direction, endorsement and steering. The SMEs also channel insights back to the leadership team, as well as the business strategy, contributors, and R&D. These teams then integrate insights, lessons learned and new knowledge into decision-making and process. The integration of these stakeholder engagement activities allows the business strategy to integrate the outcomes into Bayer’s strategy, making it more sustainable and impactful.

Bayer engages with stakeholders on sustainable development issues and incorporates the outcomes of these activities into its strategy and operations. These platforms are important opportunities to come together with different stakeholders such as customers, business community, non-governmental organization (NGO), academia and more to co-create new solutions. Bayer’s involvement in these platforms allows its participation in key global initiatives to advance sustainable development goals. Finally, these multi-stakeholder platforms enable transparent exchange fostering trust, which creates opportunities for Bayer to advance sustainable business solutions across the world.

What we’ve achieved together:

Dec 16 (Reuters) - Bayer AG (BAYGn.DE) has finalized a $698 million settlement with the U.S. state of Oregon to resolve claims that it polluted the environment with chemicals called polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, the German pharmaceutical company and the state said Thursday.

The deal, first disclosed in August, follows similar agreements with five other states and the District of Columbia, and with a nationwide class of municipal entities. Bayer still faces several other state lawsuits over PCBs.

The company said in a statement that it did not admit liability as part of the Oregon settlement, and would continued to defend the remaining cases.

Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum called the settlement a ""huge win"" that would give the state resources to clean up PCBs.

The lawsuits against Bayer stem from PCBs manufactured by U.S. seeds and pesticide company Monsanto, which Bayer acquired for $63 billion in 2018. Monsanto sold PCBs from 1935 until 1977, when it voluntarily ceased production.

The chemicals were once used widely to insulate electrical equipment, and in carbonless copy paper, caulking, floor finish and paint. The U.S. government outlawed PCBs in 1979 after discovering links to cancer.

In addition to lawsuits by states and cities, Bayer is facing claims by hundreds of people who say they were harmed by PCBs in fluorescent lights at a Washington state school. Some of those cases have gone to trial and resulted in jury verdicts against Bayer totaling $543 million, which the company is appealing.

In Klaus Kunz's more than two decades at Bayer, 2018 stood out.

That year, the German company's reputation — once synonymous with making aspirin — took a major blow. Bayer acquired Monsanto and, with it, lawsuits claiming Monsanto's signature weedkiller, Roundup, caused a type of cancer. The European Union, also in 2018, banned some pesticides that Bayer makes because scientists and regulators linked them to deaths of bees.

""It felt like we were on the grill at a barbecue,"" Kunz, Bayer's head of environmental, social, and governance strategy, told Insider.

While Kunz and Bayer have said Roundup isn't a public-health threat, as have a string of government agencies around the world, Kunz acknowledged that chemicals used to rid farms of weeds and pests can harm the environment. He said Bayer is trying to minimize those impacts while also ensuring farmers can produce enough food for a global population expected to grow by billions this century.

""People said our products are harmful to bees, and our message was, 'Our products are safe to the environment when applied according to label instructions,'"" Kunz, who has a doctorate in organic chemistry, said. ""This is very legal language. But if you reflect on that — an insecticide is safe for the environment — it's a joke. It's designed not to be safe to the environment. It's designed to interfere with the environment, whatever the label instructions. Basically, it's like making the claim that you can design medicine without side effects.""

A Bayer representative told Insider in an email that regulators had assessed the company's products and determined that they did not pose ""any unreasonable environmental impact.""

Kunz's comments follow Bayer's decision in December 2019 to change its sustainability strategy and target a 30% reduction this decade in the environmental impacts of its ""crop protection"" products and in the company's greenhouse-gas emissions.

Kunz said the discussion within Bayer had shifted from ""How can we produce more?"" to ""How can you produce more without starving the planet?""

At the same time, Kunz urged critics to acknowledge the trade-offs of reducing or eliminating pesticides. In some cases, it might mean farmers lose crops or produce fewer of them in one harvest, requiring more land to yield the same amount of food.

""We need to protect the land available for nature, not convert nature into agricultural land,"" he said, adding that doing so could exacerbate biodiversity loss and the climate crisis.

Kunz pointed to a case in Europe among sugar-beet farmers, who were allowed to use seeds treated with neonicotinoids — the pesticides banned in the EU over concerns about bee deaths — under certain emergency-use exemptions. In January, the European Court of Justice ended those exemptions, and some farmers said they no longer have an effective way have to control pests like aphids and weevils that destroy sugar beets.

Bayer and Syngenta AG, another agrochemical maker, fought the ban and lost in 2021. Kunz said Bayer accepted the EU ban on neonicotinoids, but challenged the prohibition on the grounds it violated the law and set precedence.

Bayer still sells neonicotinoids outside Europe, including in the US. The US Environmental Protection Agency in June finished its review of the neonicotinoids and found the chemicals were likely to ""adversely affect"" many threatened and endangered species. That finding could lead to further restrictions.

Kunz noted that Bayer had implemented measures meant to reduce the harm to bees, outlined in a report last year, such as changing label instructions and testing products earlier in the research-and-development process for toxicity to bees.

""This is important, because it's impossible to protect every beneficial insect,"" Kunz said. ""But it is possible to avoid applications that create irreversible damage.""

This is important, because it's impossible to protect every beneficial insect. But it is possible to avoid applications that create irreversible damage.

Beyond neonicotinoids, Kunz said Bayer's strategy to meet its environmental targets involved what he called a more systems-based approach. Farmers can grow a cycle of crops that improve soil health, water consumption, and biodiversity while controlling pests. This, in turn, can reduce the need for fertilizer and pesticides.

Bayer also makes digital tools that help farmers apply fertilizer and pesticides more precisely, which can dramatically reduce how much they're needed, Kunz said. Some 2,600 growers across 10 countries are enrolled in Bayer's carbon-farming programs, which offer financial rewards for adopting practices that store more carbon in the soil.

Bayer's sustainability efforts are attracting at least some ESG investors and ratings firms. Inclusive Capital bought a less-than-1% stake in the company in January, betting that Bayer would develop technology to boost the productivity of farming while decreasing the environmental impact.

Despite the changes, Bayer's stock is still down by more than 40% from where it was before the company, which is nearly 160 years old, acquired Monsanto. Bayer's independent sustainability council, created in 2019 to advise the board on its ESG goals, said in April last year that the company needed to resolve the Roundup litigation because ""it continuously and negatively impacts"" its reputation. What had been fewer than 100 lawsuits when Bayer closed on its purchase of Monsanto has ballooned to tens of thousands of cases.

The council also said Bayer should lobby governments for stricter policies on pesticide use and redesign its agricultural business with new services for farmers so chemical use is a last resort.

Kunz said he didn't agree with the advice that chemicals be a last choice.

""What plays into that statement is the view that synthetic things are automatically worse than natural things,"" Kunz said. ""You can use chemistry to optimize not only the stability or efficacy of products — you can optimize their safety profile.""

""What I agree with,"" he added, ""is that whenever you have the opportunity to throw less chemistry on the field, and have a similar outcome, it's better.""","The maker of Monsanto says chemicals farmers use to fight insects are safe, but it's more complicated than that, says its ESG head"

The sustainable packaging innovation challenge invites innovators and technologists to share biodegradable, compostable, dissolvable, or edible packaging designs. Formats of interest include sachets and flexible or rigid tubes.

Solutions should:

• Be sourced from biobased or renewably sourced materials.

• Be scalable.

• Be compatible with existing packaging production lines.

• Be cost effective.

• Be validated by a third party for biodegradability, compostability.

Bayer is also interested in barrier films that can be applied to biodegradable or renewably sourced materials — but without negatively affecting their end-of-life biodegradability.

Keiko Tago, head of packaging sustainability at Bayer, answered Packaging Digest’s questions about the innovation challenge’s submission criteria and how this project fits into the company’s overall commitment to sustainability.

Why create an open innovation challenge instead of researching supplier offerings directly? What do you think this project will do for you that you can’t do any other way?

Tago: To accelerate our technology scouting and overall sustainability goals, we are pursuing both strategies: collaborating with our existing suppliers and at the same time reaching out for external innovation. The open innovation challenge with yet2 allows us to tap into their strong experience and a deep network of leaders and innovators in sustainable packaging, which we think will help us find the right partners and maximize the impact of our sustainability commitments.

Your goals are to be “climate neutral by 2030 and net zero by 2050.” What do you mean by climate neutral? What does net zero mean?

Tago: We refer to the article https://www.bayer.com/en/sustainability/climate-protection where we outline our goals to be climate neutral — through the reduction of emissions and, following reduction, through offset by purchasing certificates through climate protection projects with recognized quality standards — and have net zero GHG [greenhouse gas] emissions, including our entire value chain by 2050.

Why focus on packaging biodegradability when there is little infrastructure for composting in the US?

Tago: Our portfolio has a global footprint, and we understand that waste management differs from region to region. We are seeking a variety of solutions that might be applicable to our products, including those that are home compostable and do not require specific infrastructure.

You’ve set guidelines for oxygen and moisture barrier properties. In the past (and present, I believe), most degradable materials lose their degradation characteristics when they add a barrier layer or coating. What is different now in the material technologies or science to overcome this barrier?

Tago: The packaging industry is highly motivated to increase barrier properties of degradable materials. We have seen significant innovation in barrier properties using coatings and laminations recently, particularly in the food packaging area. We would like to encourage this trend, particularly for smaller companies at early stages of development where funding may be difficult to find.

Why include dissolvable and edible packaging for consumer healthcare goods?

Tago: We want to encourage innovators with particularly novel materials that could be relevant to consumer healthcare, even if their prior focus was on other industries.

How will this challenge accelerate Bayer’s efforts to make 100% of consumer health packaging recyclable or reusable by 2030?

Tago: This is a way to increase awareness that Bayer is open to explore innovation and partner to utilize the experience of others with existing developments in this space. We currently have multiple sustainable packaging projects with some of those at an early stage of development.

Business Review talked to representatives of large companies in Romania and highlighted several solutions that can ensure a greener and safer future for the coming generations. Implementing sustainable urban development, water management, and farming, supporting businesses with green finance, and finding ways to lower carbon emissions in all our activities are among the actions that could be part of the solution.

Ana Gheorghiu, Public Affairs, Science & Sustainability Lead Romania, Bulgaria, and Republic of Moldova at Bayer: “For us, caring for sustainability is not an additional activity, but a fundamental element of our strategy and operations. As one of the global leaders in the fields of health and nutrition, we want to make a significant contribution to a high quality of life on a healthy planet: through our activities and products, we contribute to the sustainable improvement of agriculture and food security, as well as to access to quality healthcare products and services. At the same time, we seek to reduce our own environmental footprint in our operations, conserving biodiversity and reducing environmental impact.

When it comes to agriculture, we are aware that globally, more than 70% of available freshwater is used in the production of food, fuel and plant-based fibres or is needed in animal husbandry. The agricultural sector is therefore a major consumer of water. As a leading crop science company, we have a huge responsibility. We will not be able to bring the company’s vision of ‘Health for all, no one without food’ to life without considering water.

In addition, we face a worrying paradox: it is projected that by 2050, our planet will need to provide food for around 10 billion people. This will require a lot of water. Using water in a more sustainable way and growing ‘more crops per drop’ is the challenge we need to address globally. Technology and adapted farming practices could be part of the answer.

At the heart of our local sustainability strategy for the Crop Science division is identifying the right agronomic solutions to address climate change, which is having an increasingly visible impact in our geographic area. So we are trying to provide farmers with the right tools to manage the available water in the best possible way, whether it’s precision farming, drought and pest tolerant hybrids or new plant protection products with more favourable environmental profiles, which together lead to reduced water consumption, labour and energy. We want to increase farmers’ performance and profitability by using fewer resources, protect the environment – water, soil, biodiversity, and demonstrate that agriculture is part of the solution in response to major global challenges.

Because we have maize seed production and processing activities in Romania, at our station in Sinești, Ialomita, we implement specific technologies and methods that reduce the amount of water needed for cultivation. A combination of practices such as drip irrigation, integrated weed management and minimum tillage can contribute to higher water retention, allowing more water availability for crops.

Also, plant breeding, new technologies, data collection, improved accuracy of weather forecasts help farmers to make the best decision for their crop based on the weather. We have an excellent tool at our disposal, Bayer’s precision farming solution – Climate Field View, which tells us the soil’s potential to grow a crop, i.e. the content and requirements of nutrients, water or weed, disease or pest pressure. Based on the data generated, farmers can adapt inputs (i.e. water, pesticides, fertilisers) to be as efficient as possible, optimising production by using the right resources, in the right quantities and exactly where needed.”","Ana Gheorghiu, Bayer Romania: Sustainability is a fundamental element of our strategy and operations"

At this year’s Fruit Logistica taking place in Berlin from February 8-10 Bayer highlights its solutions towards regenerative agriculture (Bayer booth: hall 1.2, stand C23), meaning the balance between productivity outcomes and environmental protection, while supporting the needs of society and farmers. Key to regenerative agriculture is partnering with players along the whole food chain. “The pressure on food systems is rising each year. To nutritiously feed a growing world population while protecting the planet’s boundaries, we need to produce more food with less resources and develop solutions that can cope with climate change,” said Inci Dannenberg, President of Global Vegetable Seeds at Bayer’s Crop Science Division. “The challenges are so big and multi-faceted that they can only be addressed if we join forces.”

Biologicals innovation with tremendous environmental and business potential

One pillar in that collaborative approach towards regenerative agriculture is Bayer’s advancement in Biologicals, in other words agricultural inputs that are derived from biological instead of synthetic processing. The company has recently entered multiple promising collaborations in that space which will be showcased at Bayer’s booth at Fruit Logistica.

Bayer just lately entered a strategic partnership with Spanish biologicals company Kimitec focusing on accelerating the development and commercialization of biological crop protection products, as well as biostimulants to promote plant growth. Bayer also entered a partnership with French company M2i Group to supply fruit and vegetable growers around the world with pheromone-based biological crop protection products. In 2022, Ginkgo Bioworks became a multi-year strategic partner with Bayer to develop biological solutions in areas such as nitrogen optimization, carbon sequestration, and next generation crop protection.

Driving the development of biologicals is promising as it addresses environmental and business potential likewise. While it reduces the impact on the environment the biologicals market is expected to grow to nearly €25 billion by 2028.1.

Advancing sustainability and access to essential nutrients through seed innovation and food chain partnerships

The world is not only facing food insecurity, the need for a more sustainable and regenerative food system, and climate issues but also a nutrition gap. Bayer, through its Vegetables by Bayer business along with its Seminis® and De Ruiter® brands, has been developing various innovative solutions to address these challenges. Examples that are highlighted at Fruit Logistica include Strabena tomato with excellent attachment to vine and improved shelf life reducing the need for plastic packaging, Orange Candy® melon with good field holding and longer shelf life helping to reduce losses, or the Huntington sweet pepper which is a climate resilient variety. Bayer will also present its comprehensive offering to fight the tomato virus (ToBRFV), one of the biggest challenges for growers. This includes the De Ruiter® varieties with Intermediate Resistance2 to ToBRFV, such as Strabini, already growing commercially in many glasshouses and the two new varieties Ferreira and Novero recently launched in North America and Mexico.

To enable access to essential vitamins and minerals, particularly in underserved communities, Bayer, through The Nutrient Gap Initiative, also engages in direct intervention, education and advocacy. Originally an initiative by Bayer’s Consumer Health division, Bayer’s Crop Science division will also be part of it from 2023 onwards adding the importance of access to essential nutrients from fruits and vegetables.

Another example of how Bayer is contributing to food security and nutrition supply through engaging with partners along the food value chain is the company’s effort to curb the spread of Tropical Race 4 (TR4). This disease threats the existence of the banana as it is known. It causes a lethal wilt in banana plants and an infested plantation will lose its entire production for that year, and potentially several years more. Bayer has engaged with the Global Alliance Against TR4 and, through a module of its BayG.A.P. program, has trained hundreds of banana farmers on prevention against TR4. BayG.A.P. is a service program which supports and educates farmers worldwide to get certified and connected to the food value chain.","Bayer focuses on partnerships, sustainability, and innovation"

Bayer has said that it is ramping up efforts to provide agricultural solutions that advance sustainability and boost productivity at the same time.

The company is looking to drive innovations in sustainable farming together with partners as it aims to tackle two of the biggest challenges of our time – food security and climate change.

Its Fields of Opportunity event, which takes place today (17 October) on the Bayer ForwardFarm in Rommerskirchen, Germany, will demonstrate how farmers can benefit from reducing their ecological footprint while also increasing their yields.

“The pressure on food systems and on the environment is greater than ever before which is leading to an increase in global hunger,” said Rodrigo Santos, member of the board of management of Bayer AG and president of the company’s crop science division.

“We need to accelerate the transformation of agriculture and implement solutions that are more sustainable and more productive at the same time,” Santos outlined. ”Re-thinking global food supply and intensifying collaboration with stakeholders on all levels is key to benefiting farmers, people, and the planet.

”To this end Bayer supports the combination of innovative products and digital technologies with carbon farming, low-till, cover crops and biodiversity protection.”

The Fields of Opportunity event puts a particular focus on topics including carbon farming, Bayer’s FieldView digital farming platform, crop protection and biodiversity.

“In the future, farmers will measure the success of their farms as much by the terabytes of data captured from their fields or the tons of CO2 sequestered, as by the yield produced,” Santos predicted.

Several experts from across the sector will attend the event, including Urs Niggli (agricultural scientist), Ruramiso Mashumba (chairperson of Zimbabwe Farmers Union), Sara Menker (CEO of insights company Gro Intelligence) and Arianna Giuliodori (general secretary of the World Farmers Organization) .

They will discuss solutions to overcome global hunger, support smallholder farmers and make agriculture more sustainable.

”Bayer has put sustainability at the heart of its strategy, ultimately aiming to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in major agricultural markets – per kilogram of crop yield – by 30 per cent by 2030,” the group stated.

”In addition, the company works towards reducing the environmental impact of crop protection products by 30 per cent by 2030 and has committed to enable 100m smallholder farmers to become more productive and profitable farms.”",Bayer focuses on food security and climate change

Bayer AG has initiated several “100 million challenges,” including its recent investment in sustainable health products to advance the company’s 2030 sustainability commitments. They’re pouring €100 million to further enable sustainable innovation, production, and consumption of Consumer Health products including global brands such as Aspirin, Bepanthen, Claritin, and Elevit.

We’ll get to the packaging details shortly. But first, it’s important to see the connection between human health and the environment. “When you think about the environment and climate issues, we're talking about the environment as a social determinant of health,” says Daniella Foster, Global Vice President and Head of Public Affairs, Science, and Sustainability for Bayer’s Consumer Health division. “Reflecting on the past 20 years, we know that climate change has been a cause behind a growing number of health concerns, and we also know that underserved populations are particularly vulnerable.”

“I’ve spent a lot of time in the ESG space, and oftentimes when we talk about the environment or climate, we're usually just talking about the environment. I think one of the key pieces here that we're really trying to unite and put a focus on is that connection between human health and the environment.” —Daniella Foster

Data suggests that approximately half of the world's population does not have access to basic and essential health services, while the same populations are often in communities significantly impacted by climate, resulting in being hit from multiple sides. “Rising temperatures, poor air quality, pollen counts, all these things are increasing… this leads to heart disease, respiratory illnesses, allergies, etc. For people without access to medical care, they're really having a hard time managing or treating these conditions. This also impacts their ability to work. In some cases, it's perpetuating a cycle of poverty,” she explains.

The company is setting out to tackle the inclusive growth challenge and environmental challenge together, looking to protect people's health in both the short- and long-term, while also reaching science-based targets.

Bayer’s plan includes (1) prioritizing sustainable brands, products, and packaging, (2) urging collective industry action, and (3) targeting carbon emissions, including net zero by 2050.

One of the concepts that attracted Foster to Bayer is that they no longer separate business strategy and sustainability strategy. “They’re integrated and we bake sustainability into our business and how we think about our value chain,” she says. “The renumeration of our Board of Management is tied to our sustainability strategy and progress. So, it’s a core part of how we operate. We also have an external sustainability council that reviews our plans and progress, and they pressure test us.”

Products and packaging

Bayer has been making headway in improving the sustainability of its products and packaging for a few years, obtaining data to determine where impact can be made and how best to prioritize efforts.

With the €100 million investment, Bayer explains it is “committed to finding new solutions that inspire the sustainable creation and consumption of the company’s over-the-counter products and supplements.”





The company is targeting that by 2030 (where quality and safety permit), 100% of Bayer Consumer Health’s packaging will be recyclable or reusable and all packaging will include consumer-friendly recycling information, and the division’s packaging will include an average of 50% recycled content and 100% of purchased paper will be sustainably sourced.

In setting packaging targets, Bayer assessed the recyclability of their portfolio and identified the formats used at highest volumes—paper, plastic bottles, blister packs, and flexible tubes. Next, they evaluated the current recyclability of these formats and the technical and financial feasibility of conversion into recyclable packaging solutions, setting priorities accordingly. Their progress thus far includes:

Shipping boxes included 80% recycled content by the end of 2021 . Many initiatives already taking place at manufacturing sites gave Bayer a baseline toward the goals. Additional transformation has been driven by strong partnership with their supplier network, and continued sharing of best practices among sites. ( Editor’s note: Bayer chose not to reveal its packaging suppliers.)

including Aleve, Claritin, Iberogast, and Redoxon to use certified paper from responsibly managed forests. A program was implemented to transition to digital marketing and reduce the footprint of the division’s printed promotional materials. Bayer has worked on prioritizing digital marketing for years, which Foster explains “makes sense from both a sustainability standpoint and reaching the consumer where they are. For instance, in some of our Latin American markets at Bayer, the government-approved use of leveraging QR codes helps educate users on a range of health topics. Consumers are getting much more comfortable with QR codes thanks to restaurants and stores incorporating them during the pandemic. Instead of printing brochures or other materials, we can create much more dynamic and sustainable content to help people take better care of themselves. ”

With partnership and collective action being so powerful, Foster says she was particularly excited for the Q4 2021 launch of the Global Self Care Federation (GSCF) Environmental Charter. The GSCF counts Bayer, Sanofi, GSK, and J&J among its members working across competitive lines to deliver carbon emission reductions and more sustainable packaging. “I think this charter was a really great example of how an industry can come together in this area of environmental action and determine the areas where we all want to see progress and whereby working together, we can get farther quicker,” she says. “This is going to be critical. I always say—especially when we're talking about environment—no one company, entity, government, etc. owns the environment. We all have to work collectively and collaboratively to reach the UN sustainable development goals. I see it much more as a team sport.”

Similar to Consumer Health, a priority area for Bayer’s Pharmaceutical division is to create change within their operations, which includes switching to green electricity and investing in projects to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in their production facilities. The Pharma division is also working to reduce the ecological footprint of their products, but with prescription drug packaging oriented toward function, there is less optimization potential than on the Consumer Health side. While too soon to tell, Foster notes that there may be knowledge that comes from GSCF efforts that apply to pharmaceutical packaging: “When you crack that code and get to that solution, which is going to take a lot of time, then that paves the way for solutions to potentially be scaled where it makes sense, where you can ensure safety, efficacy, etc.”

Tangibles in cutting carbon

Many companies are looking to reach climate neutrality and net-zero emissions with supply chains responsible for such a large proportion of an organization’s global emissions. Bayer has an overarching commitment to climate neutrality by 2030 (Scopes 1 and 2) and net zero across the entire value chain (Scopes 1, 2 and 3) by 2050.

Progress in Consumer Health to-date includes:

Reduction of carbon footprint across production facilities through energy efficiency and renewable energy projects, contributing to a 30% reduction in carbon emissions between 2019 and 2020 alone. As Foster explains, “When we move, we move fast.” This includes upgrading HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) systems, representing “very unsexy but really critical updates when you're talking about energy efficiency and reduction,” she says.

65% of energy consumed at three Consumer Health production sites (one each in Germany, Guatemala, and Spain) is generated from renewable sources.

Bayer has monitored its carbon footprint for some time, so they had a good base understanding of their Scope 1 and 2 footprints. Their Board of Management set the intention to be climate neutral by 2030 and empowered the company to prioritize this across the value chain. Their science-based targets have been reviewed and endorsed by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi).

The company also has a partnership with CDP [formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project], which aims to make environmental reporting a business norm. Bayer is also working with suppliers to obtain data and understand some of the biggest opportunities to work on together on reducing their carbon footprints. Approximately 73% of Consumer Health suppliers have submitted their data.

Expanding access

Accessibility to products is a major goal for Bayer Consumer Health—they set the target of expanding access to everyday health for 100 million people in underserved communities by 2030. “We know that in underserved communities, having access to over-the-counter products, nutritional products, and supplements in many cases serves as a health lifeline. We see a lot of people who are in health deserts as well, without access,” says Foster. “Layering on top of the access piece, health education and literacy are also incredibly important, and they're often overlooked. The right information and education can be extremely powerful, and we're seeing this highlighted in the midst of the pandemic we've all been living in.”

For various underserved communities, Bayer has spent time researching ethnographies to understand the challenges they face and access gaps that can be bridged, and then overlayed that information with medical needs. This way, Bayer can tailor and design access to products with specific communities in mind. Beyond sustainability criteria, the company has baked the accessibility and availability of products into their innovation pipeline.

In the Pharmaceuticals division, Bayer set a goal to expand access to modern day family planning and contraceptives for 100 million women in low- and middle-income countries. “Some may ask why family planning? We know access to family planning is essential—it improves not only women's health, but it improves overall economic opportunities,” Foster says. “It's key in terms of tackling cycles of poverty and breaking down barriers to progress for gender equality. So that's how we start to unite some of these goals.” (On a related note, New York Times best-seller “Drawdown” on climate change solutions features chapters on family planning and educating girls as key sustainability practices in reducing greenhouse gases over time.)

Foster says that transparency in these “100 million challenges” is key—they keep metrics on their site and display their methodology as they look at improving access now, not just 10 years from now.

Bayer also launched its Nutrient Gap Initiative in 2021, which is focused on expanding access to vitamins and minerals for 50 million people in underserved communities by 2030. WHO data shows that one in three people suffer from malnutrition. “We see this being most critical for pregnant women because if you don't have the right nutrition, it impacts all aspects of your life. This can exacerbate the cycle of poverty if you have children that are not born healthy, lacking nutrients,” she explains.

Not only is this prenatal focus in line with Bayer’s fundamental principle that every child should have the best start in life, but scientific research shows the importance of multiple micronutrient supplementation (MMS), having been recently placed on the WHO’s list of essential medicines.

“We know that when pregnant mothers have MMS, there's less likelihood of stunting and cognitive delays. We've partnered with several NGOs—for example, we work closely with Vitamin Angels,” notes Foster.

This is not merely a donation program. Bayer is working to create systemic change and improve the health outcomes of women via interventions with local community and healthcare workers, with wraparound nutrition and educational programs to boost adherence and meet people where they are. “The idea is that the program offers 180-day micronutrient intervention,” she highlights. “That then becomes a part of the implementation research that helps the government assess and incorporate better antenatal care guidelines into the overall healthcare system to provide better care for women.”





While this takes time, effort, and partnership, Foster likens it to the old adage of teaching people to fish to provide long-term health outcomes versus giving people a fish to eat for a day. “We’re so committed… How do you teach and how do you provide the right tools so that someone is set up for a lifetime? We prioritize impact generation. We've had a great impact, even just in 2021 we reached 20 million people globally through the Nutrient Gap Initiative.”

Things are evolving in real-time, but Bayer is starting to see the unification of sustainable packaging and expanded access. The aforementioned digital solutions, for example, offer a lot of potential. “Data is showing that underserved communities get QR codes—people like them. They’re simple and easy to use,” she explains. “This is an area where we see potential to unite human health and the environment. On one hand, if you have QR codes, you eliminate the need for things like leaflets and you can probably reduce the size of your packaging. On the other hand, you can also start to build into that QR code things like health education, literacy, and additional tools so it's in one place and easy for the consumer. We’re already starting this in some of our regions, including in Latin America.”

Drivers from all sides

The move to more sustainable practices is driven by company goals, the financial world, consumers, and employees. Bayer’s mission is “health for all, hunger for none,” and as Foster emphasizes, it’s not just the sustainability mission but the company mission. “I'm driven by it. Our team members are driven by it. When you have that as your mission and you start to think about these different aspects of sustainability and the way that we've baked it into our business, that's how it all comes together.”

ESG [environmental, social, and governance] criteria has been in the investor lexicon in different forms for approximately a decade. But the past four years have brought heightened pressure, from Blackrock’s Letter to CEOs on climate change to ratings such as the Wall Street Journal’s ranking of the most sustainably managed companies in the world (in which Bayer is listed).

Foster notes that the pandemic has accelerated this pressure even further and has shown how critical sustainability is: “For myself and for other sustainability practitioners, we've been saying this for over a decade. I think the pandemic really highlighted two key things: one, the importance of environment and, two, the importance of human health. They're also completely linked, and you can't divorce the two.”

On the employee front, sustainability is less about what you say and more about transparency: what you're doing, why you're doing it, and how you're measuring it. She says, “What we're seeing at least at Bayer that really excites me is we have a whole organization mobilized behind sustainability, which I think is critical because sustainability shouldn't just be the job of people like me. If you're embedding it into your business, it becomes a part of everyone's job… and that definitely becomes a driver of retention, of employee satisfaction, and of pride.”

There is an increasing expectation for sustainability among consumers, particularly for household names. “For every single one of our brands, sustainability is baked into the brand’s purpose. It's not something separate on the side, it's just become a part of the ethos of how we think about our brands, our products, etc.,” she notes.

Consumers are ever more adept at spotting greenwashing claims. As organizations ask themselves about the areas they can influence and make meaningful change in the short-, mid- and long-term, transparency on progress and measurable goals are critical. Bayer’s site features a section on the auditing process they go through, and progress and methodology are shared in their annual sustainability report. “In any journey that's long and ambitious, you're also going to hit challenges, and that’s ok. Anything worth doing, you're going to have roadblocks,” says Foster. “But that’s another place where that full transparency of ‘here’s what we're seeing and here’s where we need to go’ is fundamental, and where collective action can help.”

Industry collaboration

Foster, who is co-chair of the GSCF Environmental Charter committee, says that collective action is key in scaling solutions to big challenges that are truly sustainable. “I also think when you talk about systemic challenges, whether it's waste systems or climate change as a whole, these are not the kind of challenges that one government, company, etc., is going to solve on their own, nor should they. We have to work together,” she says.

Beyond the power of working across competitive lines, opportunity also lies in working with suppliers. Reflecting on her previous experience at the State Department, Foster notes that she helped set up their first office of public-private partnership at a time when these partnerships weren’t the norm. Some of the most effective public-private partnerships she saw were in the areas of health—including PEPFAR focused on HIV/AIDS—where companies, NGOs, and governments worked together to identify effective solutions.

“Sometimes just making the commitment to come together and having very clear focus areas can be the hardest bit,” says Foster. “We're now doing that through the GSCF Environmental Charter, and I think that that is going to open up a world of opportunity as we start to talk about more sustainable solutions and materials, working collaboratively with suppliers.”

As our recent series on predictions 2021 from the procurement and supply chain market tells us, sustainability, social value and environmental themes are only going to become bigger and more important drivers for procurement (and business) over the next decade — and beyond.

In a recent article, we gave an introduction to the Sustainable Procurement Pledge (SPP), a global forum of more than 2,500 industry, academic and third-sector procurement professionals who are committing to sustainable practices and ethics, and we featured an interview with one of its ambassadors. We spoke to the co-founding member of that group about what sustainability means to him and his organization, and to understand how he translates what he pledges, into what he does.

Thomas Udesen is CPO at Bayer, a life science company with a more than 150-year history and core competencies in the areas of healthcare and agriculture.

How do you find the right procurement technology and vendor for your company? Spend Matters’ new 5-step “Procurement Technology Buyer’s Guide” can help — with how-to documents, checklist templates and other tips.

He is passionate about the important role procurement can play in helping businesses achieve their sustainability goals, and therefore in helping society to create a more sustainable future.

“In order to do that,” he says, “it is vital that we share our experiences, learnings and opinions and the tools to help make that happen” — hence the role of the SPP.

How we think about sustainability

Before delving into how Bayer employs sustainable methods in its day-to-day procurement operations, we asked Thomas about the more general assumptions made about sustainability in the workplace that might be hindering its adoption, and why it’s important for organizations to do something about it.

By acting responsibly, applying economic, environmental, social and corporate governance standards in collaboration with suppliers and partners, it stands to reason that any firm can minimize risks, create stable, long-term business relationships, and safeguard its supply of materials and services and hence its competitiveness.

So what’s holding them back?

“Sustainability is an amazing business,” Thomas says, “but there is an underlying misconception that becoming sustainable incurs a cost, which, if you think about it more comprehensively and with a longer-term view, it doesn’t. It is fundamentally about eliminating waste and converting it into a resource, which of course caries a value — less waste, more efficiency, better business results. The main thing is, with governments and society putting more pressure on companies, it’s something no firm can ignore. You have to see it as total cost of ownership; there is a material benefit to pursuing what is bio-based and manufactured in a sustainable way, and at Bayer, we get that.”

Having the commitment to do something about it

“Commitment has to come from the top,” Thomas says.

Bayer is among the 100+ companies worldwide that have signed up for the science-based targets initiative that helps firms transition to a low-carbon economy.

“That means we have huge targets when it comes to reducing carbon emissions for scopes 1, 2 and 3. Because our whole business model is based on how we provide more food and medicine to a world that is increasing in population yet with less available land, it’s really not difficult for me to argue why we have to do this. It also means that what I do with the SPP is completely in alignment with what the company is doing, and it’s liberating for me that I don’t have to apply different standards inside and outside of my job.”

Although about 15,000 firms have signed up to the UN Global Compact principles, when you really look under the hood of their supply chains or procurement organizations to see what’s really going on, Thomas finds it “disheartening … many organizations admit to taking a very defensive approach, and thus do the bare minimum, even when agreed at the CEO level.”

And why is that?

“Often it’s regulators or NGOs making non-commitment punitive. Sometimes it’s that frontline practitioners don’t realize they have a mandate, or don’t believe their leaders are really engaged. In my experience most CEOs and CFOs really do get it, particularly when the CPO is effective at explaining the business case. So the mandate is often more about up-skilling ourselves to be able to do that, but in some cases practitioners simply don’t have access to the tools and practical steps they need to do this in a collaborative and pragmatic way.”

That is of course where the SPP comes in: It encourages individuals to commit — not the procurement function or the organization, but the person. And it ensures knowledge and tools are shared freely across a community of peers, whether practitioners, students or recruiters.

“It’s where we can be honest and have a more collaborative dialog,” he explains.

Walking the talk

Bayer seems to have nailed it, but the firm is very honest in how it goes about achieving good sustainable practices.

“The key is not to try to address sustainability in the supply chain in isolation,"" Thomas says. ""It’s not possible for one company to solve all the issues on its own — you have to be realistic. At Bayer we partner with associations in a united approach to have a much bigger impact.

“Ten years ago, we joined the industry Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Initiative (PSCI) and co-founded Together for Sustainability (TfS). Along with five other companies we have grown to 29 member companies that control a total spend of €320 billion with 10,000 supplier assessments going on at any one time — so we have created a large machine to bring transparency into the lengthy and complex chemical supply chain.”

Not everyone can aspire to that, but what we can all do is weave sustainability into our supplier processes, for example at Bayer:

“We recognized that for supplier sustainability assessments we could be spending time on tens of questionnaires rather than getting things done and allocating that resource more efficiently. So the assessments and audit results are exchanged through IT platforms, meaning that duplication efforts for our suppliers have been eliminated. It also means that time, resources and costs are significantly reduced, and sustainability standards in our chemical and pharma global supply chains are mutually improved.

“Through PSCI and TfS, as part of a global supplier engagement program for those that have chosen to collaborate, we access the market and assess and improve sustainable sourcing practices by approaching these topics structurally. We respect any antitrust considerations, and the link between the seller and buyer is never revealed. But it does mean we are aiming for better social, economic and environmental outcomes for all those involved in the supply chain, including its workers and local communities.”

Through its sheer procurement volume Bayer exerts considerable influence on society and the environment, in 2019 it procured goods and services accounting for about €23 billion.

“When it comes to our immediate supply chain of 60,000+ suppliers,” says Thomas, “we have a typical segmentation process that looks at risk profiles, business impact and the nature of the relationship. We use those to promote transparency and drive engagement. We agree and communicate that if a supplier wants to become or remain strategic, and be treated preferentially — and lets use the analogy of gathering air miles for that — they have to show leadership and sustainable practices, which for us means a minimum evaluation of 45 by EcoVadis. Without this, a supplier loses its air miles and becomes transactional, with less access to opportunities. It means for both parties that sustainability is being taken very seriously.

“As part of our regular supplier engagement, we carry out an assessment on the high-risk suppliers. We decide on corrective actions where needed to drive progress, make sure they are ‘walking the talk’ and delivering on expectations. For those not operating at an acceptable standard, the next time the plane takes off they simply will not be boarding — we will disengage over time and make sure we work with companies that take it more seriously.

“We need this level of adherence to help us stay within the 1.5°C global warming target that is part of our science-based targets commitment. To do this we need to make sure our scope 3 inbound carbon emissions are reducing over the next few years. We have tangible maximum limits to work within, so if we are working with suppliers who are themselves not reducing their own carbon targets, then we will simply not be able to make the numbers work. Thus we are serious about shifting business to companies that are generally more responsible, and aiming to move 100% of our energy use towards renewables. Not only does this help our goal to be carbon-neutral by 2050, but shifting from fossil fuel to hydro, solar or wind actually saves in energy costs over a 10- to 20-year period. If you look at sustainability for the long term — it makes good business sense.”

How big a part can technology play in the sustainability agenda?

“I am totally convinced,” he says “that the procurement tech providers are mission-critical in providing the necessary transparency needed to achieve sustainability goals. Today more and more solution providers are creating a data-driven dialog, and it’s really encouraging that so many are coming up with innovative solutions for transparency, tracking, provenance and inclusive business models that help you make sure you are dealing with ethical suppliers. Having that ability captured in the marketplace is highly welcome.

“The challenge for the practitioner is that the tech landscape is still complex and fragmented, by that I mean that the ability of the various providers to provide one comprehensive solution is very low, which might hinder adoption because having 10 different providers focused on one aspect makes it more difficult for the CPO who has all 10 to look after at once. Having said that, the notion of a one-stop shop is not realistic either, and the best-of-breed landscape is also fragmented. So it’s a challenge for the market. In an ideal world, for requisitioners like my company that want oversight of anti-corruption, cybersecurity, sustainability, risk management and so on, there would be one interface for the whole ecosystem of players. Right now, in my opinion, provider choice is very big and specialization too narrow.”

In your organization, how do you make sure the sustainability message is adhered to?

“The aim is to get it hardwired into our processes, so that segmentation of suppliers follows clear rules and oversight is based on good quality master data that encompasses all transactions from all corners of the organization. We need to make sure that our category strategies clearly include the aspects of sustainability, inclusivity, diversity and so on, and that means having checks and balances that they are reflected in who we work with and how we approach the market.

“It takes a lot of work initially to harmonize all your processes globally to obtain real-time access to all transactions, which a lot of procurement teams struggle with, especially those in SMEs with fewer resources. But it is precisely those firms that can make a real difference, since they represent 80% of the world economy and form the backbone of business. So it’s crucial they understand the long-term advantage and that the hard work upfront, which includes fixing taxonomies, data maintenance, process alignment and leveraging digitalization, pays off when you have a real handle on sustainability.

“Of course once you have sustainable supply chains, you have resilience, which is paramount for all companies, and particularly for Bayer, because if supply chains break down, life-saving medicines don’t get delivered, and if seeds can’t get in the ground, people go hungry. So clearly we take this extremely seriously. But I can say with absolute conviction that throughout the whole of the pandemic at no point did we experience any failure in supply due to materials shortage or disruption, and that is because we have spent at least the past 10 years working with the right kind of people who deliver on their promises.

“This is why it’s important to remember that the investment in sustainability is not something you consider from quarter to quarter, or year to year, it’s long-term, and nothing to do with cost — it’s about making sure your firm can live up to its purpose, which for Bayer is ‘Health for All, Hunger for None.’

Many thanks to Thomas Udesen for sharing his considerable insight and passion. The ambassadors of the SPP are increasing in numbers, but in order to reach their target of 1 million procurement professionals, both private and public sector, by 2030, they need to keep doubling year on year.

Fertilizer prices, too, saw all-time highs as 2021 turned into 2022, further exacerbating food inflation.

Prices for both sets of commodities have continued to rise this year as supply chain disruption — caused in part by the Covid-19 pandemic — continues.

As pointed out by panelists at the recent Bloomberg New Economy Forum in Singapore, all this is taking place against the backdrop of a longer-term trend towards a larger population demanding more food – with diminishing land and natural resources to produce it.

Panellist Dave MacLennan, CEO of Cargill, argued that the agrifood supply chain has “proven to be surprisingly resilient” amid all the short-term upheaval. But he added that climate change presents a major challenge over the longer term, citing the supply impact of last August’s Hurricane Ida, which took out one of his company’s key grain terminals in Louisiana, US.

“We’ve been able to get food from where it’s produced to where it’s needed, with some exceptions,” he told attendees. “Notwithstanding the inevitable natural disasters coming from climate volatility, the food supply chain has worked relatively well – even amid Covid-19. But that’s not something we can take for granted.”

MacLennan’s co-panelist and counterpart at Bayer, Werner Baumann, offered a cautiously optimistic outlook: while acknowledging the size of the task ahead, he argued that agriculture is going through its most rapid period of technological and scientific advancement in modern times – meaning we already have many of the solutions waiting in the wings.

“Agriculture has become more sustainable. But if you look at the massive impacts that climate change is going to have on all of us […] we have to reduce the footprint that is being used by agriculture while also increasing yields,” he said. “At a minimum, [that means] not increasing acreage, but bringing more intensification on existing acreage – while at the same time freeing up acreage for reforestation and carbon sequestration.”

Baumann also highlighted technologies such as biological nitrogen fixation, which could reduce the environmental costs of fertilizer production and application, as well as selectively-bred crop varieties that can ensure more predictable harvests.

Reappraising GMOs, prioritizing soil health

With regards to the latter, one controversial technology that is returning to the limelight is genetic engineering, including genetically-modified organisms (GMOs).

Baumann said he sensed a “renewed openness” to genetically modified crops in agriculture, particularly from emerging markets such as those in Africa and Asia.

GMOs “absolutely” have to be part of the picture when it comes to building a food system with more resilience and more sustainability, MacLennan said; noting that when he became Cargill’s CEO in 2013, the controversy around the technology was at its height.

“They got branded ‘Frankenfood,’ but ultimately, they have been behind — since the early part of the 20th century — increased yields, increased access to food, increased farmer livelihoods around the world. They’re a tool for sustainability,” he said.

“Mangoes have been GMO since the 1960s, but people became fearful [of the tech more recently].”

Another area pinpointed both by Baumann and MacLennan was soil health, and the techniques that can preserve and improve it.

“The current iteration of sustainability in farming has to include regenerative agriculture — whether it be no-till, whether it be crop rotation — to improve soil health and use soil for carbon sequestration,” MacLennan told delegates. “[These] will become more a part of the solution to improve farmer livelihoods and improve the greenhouse gas footprint of farming.”

Of course, many of these soil-focused practices are nothing new; in one form or another, they’ve been used in farming for millenia. But this fundamental nature of many sustainable farming solutions goes to show how the agricultural industry can actually lead the wider world on climate change adaption and mitigation, according to panelist Sara Menker – whose startup Gro Intelligence aims, in her words, to track “the real-time supply and demand of every agricultural product on Earth.”

“There’s a tradeoff between economic growth and ecological preservation,” she said. “If you’re monitoring supply on a real-time basis, you actually have to understand the Earth, our soils, the environment. Sustainability has been part of agriculture since agriculture started in the Neolithic Revolution. [It’s] not that data is the answer, but people who understand agricultural markets, I would argue probably understand our Earth, our environment, our climate, in ways that the average person in this world doesn’t understand – because it is their reality every single day. And so there’s a big role that the agricultural industry can play in sustainability conversations – not just in markets, but in education.”

Information is power, and power is money

On that point, all the panelists were in agreement: that the key to boosting agriculture’s sustainability and resilience lies with the individual at the center of the industry — the farmer — and making sure they have the tools and know-how they need.

But for the majority of the world’s growers, advanced technologies like those outlined by Baumann, MacLennan, and Menker remain far out of reach. While the hope is that access to these can be ‘democratized,’ smallholders across the world’s emerging economies have more immediate technological needs altogether, according to panelist Alloysius Attah, CEO of Ghanaian agtech startup Farmerline.

An estimated 84% of the world’s farms are smallholdings of two hectares or less; research indicates that around one-third of the world’s food is produced by these operations.

What’s more is that most of these smallholder farms are located in regions such as Sub-Saharan Africa, which are also likely to see the biggest increases in food demand over the coming decades.

“They’re often not in the middle of most conservations, and they struggle to access high-quality fertilizers and seeds,” Attah said of his continent’s smallholders. “We need to find new ways to make capital more affordable for farmers so they can afford all the tools they need, in order to grow more food to feed the future.”

It’s part of a bigger problem with capital in the agtech space, Menker suggested.

“All of this is going to cost money. And that money comes with risk, and you have to price [that risk],” she said.

In the early 2000s, Menker was an energy commodities trader. She noted that, at the time, many producers wanted to hedge oil two years forward – but that it was difficult to sell time horizons that long to the markets.

But by the time she left to start Gro, she was able to sell oil futures contracts with 10- to 20-year timeframes.

“That funded all sorts of innovations in the energy market that made things like shale oil [and] shale gas possible. Gas prices went down, coal got priced out of the market, renewables became a possibility. Really long-term changes happened because capital flowed well; and capital flows well when there is good information,” she said.

“So data becomes necessary infrastructure for driving transition and change. [This] change is going to require lots and lots of long-term capital, and ag capital today is too short term.”

At the farmer level, too, Attah said that information — or the lack of it — is holding back the cause of food sustainability and resilience.

“The biggest challenge is that information today is in English, it’s online; it’s not in a form that’s easy for most farmers to understand,” he said, pointing out that Nigeria alone has over 200 languages in everyday use, aside from English; while many farmers in poorer or more remote regions lack internet access.

While these language, capital, and technology barriers remain in place, there’s little hope that the latest, sustainability-directed farm products and knowledge are going to be adopted in such communities – let alone cutting-edge agtech.

“So there’s massive room to figure out how to use data tools to give info to farmers,” Attah said. “If you want to be able to communicate how to use seeds well, reduce impacts on soil, and so on, then local language [products and services] is one of the ways to go.”

MacLennan noted that he’d visited farms in Zambia where growers were applying fertilizer using a soda bottle cap. “Are we spending enough time and capital? I think the answer is no […] You can double, triple [those farmers’] yields just with modern techniques,” he said.

Spending Elon’s $6 billion

Not long before the Singapore event, multi-billionaire and Tesla CEO Elon Musk had tweeted that he’d sell $6 billion worth of his electric car company’s stock and commit the money to solving world hunger – but only if the UN World Food Program could tell him exactly how it would be spent.

Musk was responding to comments made by the World Food Program’s director David Beasley, who’d told CNN the ultra-wealthy — including, specifically, Musk and Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos — should “step up now, on a one-time basis [and donate $6 billion] to help 42 million people that are literally going to die [of hunger] if we don’t reach them.”

Asked by the moderator how they’d spend the cash, Attah and MacLennan both opted for infrastructure investment.

“You and I can go on Amazon and buy what we want. But small-scale farmers are often ‘takers’ of services,” Attah said. “There’s one guy in their village that does fertilizer, and that’s it […] They need more options and choices where people compete on quality and price. Infrastructure will give people more services on the farm.”

Taking a more macro perspective, MacLennan said that investment in infrastructure such as ports and waterways could help get much more food from where it is grown to where it is needed – exampling South America.

“You’ve got this massive crop-growing region of the world that doesn’t yet have the appropriate infrastructure to get it out of the fields and to the consumers. It doesn’t do any good if you increase yields and increase farmer training and education, if you can’t get [food] to where it’s needed,” he said.

Baumann reeled off a number of areas that should get Musk’s money — from carbon farming to analytics and traceability tech — but he underlined that “whatever we do should be farmer-centric. The solution is the farmer.”

For Menker, the $6 billion donation would be more than welcome — but would still be a drop in the ocean if the aim is to make food systems more resilient and sustainable in the long run, rather than just solving the world’s immediate hunger problem.

“It’s going to take a lot more than $6 billion,” she said. “When you look at small-scale farming, scale doesn’t exist, so the cost of infrastructure is artificially too high. So how do you create aggregation methodologies for communities in parts of the world where that scale doesn’t exist?”

Her answer would be to use Musk’s $6 billion to establish a new financial institution focused on agrifood sustainability.

“That [could] help create the mechanisms to start financing all the changes that need to be made,” she said.","Bayer, Cargill & startup CEOs talk ag sustainability in Singapore"

The founder and CEO of Ecovative Design and MyForestFoods Co. (previously known as Atlast) is inarguably one of the most active and prominent global players in the wonderful world of mycelium.

Here are just a few of Bayer’s incredible achievements since the last Q&A with vegconomist:

Nov 2020: Atlast Food Co launches its mushroom-based bacon alternative

April 2021: Ecovative raises $60M in a Series D, for mycelium based packaging, alt leather, and bacon.

April 2021: Atlast Food Co secures $40 million from investors including Robert Downey Jr.’s Footprint Coalition Ventures, bringing the total raise to $100M

Jan 2022: The launch of Forager, a division focused on designing, marketing, and manufacturing vegan, plastic-free leather-like materials and foams for the fashion and automotive industries

Jan 2022: Atlast rebrands to MyForest Foods as it prepares to upscale fungus-based bacon

This is a man with a lot to say about mycelium and mushrooms! Without further ado, let’s get into it.

Where did your interest in Mycelium begin?

It began as a kid growing up on a farm in Vermont, where fungi are abundant, you can see them literally holding the soil together. My interest in mycelium as a material really kicked off while I was studying at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI). That’s where professor Burt Swersey challenged us to “find a solution” as the final project for his Inventor’s Studio class, to design something according to his philosophy, “don’t do nonsense, do something meaningful.”

My classmate Gavin McIntyre (now our CCO) and I worked up the concept of using mycelium to grow materials. In 2007, with the support of Professor Swersey, we founded Ecovative, which focused on mycelium as a packing material (originally, we started with a focus on insulation, but the market wasn’t there yet). Since then, Ecovative has engineered new mycelium structures that match or out-perform plastic, leather, even meat, all of which turn to compost at the end of their useful life.

What was the thinking behind Atlast Food Co’s recent rebranding to MyForest Foods?

This has been a big year for MyForest Foods — the company is growing by leaps and bounds, quickly building a top-notch team of food innovation experts and preparing to produce at a whole new scale. It felt like the right time to take stock and ensure that everything was aligned to our mission of feeding the future delicious, nutritious mycelium-based foods, with a view to Nature as the foundation of it all.

“we are in the midst of an exciting year of growth”

What projects are you most excited about that you’re working on MyForest Foods?

In 2020, Ecovative launched a new company, now called MyForest Foods, that grows whole-cut meat from gourmet mushroom mycelium. As I mentioned before, we are in the midst of an exciting year of growth. Right now, we are hyper-focused on scaling up to provide more commercial products in 2022. We’re especially eager to get our flagship product, MyBacon, onto as many plates as possible, so that people whose diets are vegan or vegetarian or anyone who just wants to eat less meat can still “bring home the bacon”.

Speaking of scale, we recently partnered with Whitecrest Mushrooms Ltd., a huge gourmet mushroom farm in Canada, and adapted their existing facilities to produce nearly three million pounds of MyBacon each year, on less than one acre of land. With all the mushroom farms already in the world, eager to diversify what they produce, the ability to add MyForest mycelium to their product lines will be a game-changer.

“The bacon product is an example of what mycelium is capable of for food, and we think it opens a whole new category.”

We are also building two brand new facilities that will total 120,000 square feet of new infrastructure. Between a facility in Saratoga Springs, and the world’s largest mycelium farm here in the New York Capital Region coming online in the fall, we’re laying the groundwork for a truly monumental leveling up of mycelium production. It means we can continue producing our popular MyBacon, while working towards introducing new products in the near future.

How disruptive do you predict MyForest Foods’ bacon product to be, both to the animal-free and conventional bacon markets?

I wouldn’t call this product disruptive so much as essential, or foundational. The bacon product is an example of what mycelium is capable of for food, and we think it opens a whole new category. When you take a look at the numbers, over 80% of traditional meat sold is under the category of ‘whole cut’.

Despite their much smaller share of sales, and due to the nature of typical alt-protein ingredients they use, plant-based products are largely concentrated in the “ground” category of meats — think sausage or burger patties. This leaves the plant-based, whole-cut category wide open. Our star ingredient, mycelium, is grown—not ground—made of fibers aligned like muscles, so eating MyBacon is just like biting into a whole cut.

“Bacon is just the beginning”

Bacon is one of the bigger segments of this market and also a “can’t give up” item on many people’s shopping lists. MyBacon offers the texture of traditional pork bacon because our super-ingredient, mycelium, is similar in structure to meat. Will it disrupt real bacon? Only if enough people want the culinary experience without the usual cost to their health or the environment. But mycelium opens a much wider world of possibilities for the plant-based food category. Bacon is just the beginning.

Do you feel that interest in fungi and mycelium is a trend or here to stay?

Fungi have been with us for billions of years, so they’re definitely not a trend or passing fad, but I think the interest in fungi has deep roots and is going to last. Think of how useful plants are and have been for humanity — fungi is another whole kingdom of life on the same scale as plants and animals, and the value to society could also be comparable as we finally discover their potential as materials, food and more.

“The work of realizing a more sustainable and healthy relationship with our planet isn’t a trend, it’s our future.”

Mother Earth is facing mounting crises, and I think that’s part of why there is so much interest in fungi — they seem to offer hope of reconnection with Nature. They also offer hope for new ways of meeting human needs, including for food — lifecycle studies that compare pork production to mushroom cultivation show the dramatic potential for impact on factors like carbon emissions, land and water use. The work of realizing a more sustainable and healthy relationship with our planet isn’t a trend, it’s our future.

Congratulations on the launch of Forager – what will be the scope of this project?

Thank you! We’re very excited about it. The scope of Forager is to develop, manufacture and bring mycelium soft goods — leather-like hides, foams for use in shoes and other apparel, for starters — to market. Forager is doing this in partnership with some very big brands right out the gate, including PVH, Bestseller, and VivoBarefoot. Their market and product design expertise, combined with Forager’s mastery of mycelium manufacturing, will be the creative force that brings mycelium materials to the market. Consumers have been hearing about mycelium materials for years — Forager is how we put them in people’s hands.

What is the current status of Ecovative’s mycelium foundry and what makes it such a key facility?

The Mycelium Foundry is at the heart of our collaborations with other brands and industries. It’s where we put our massive library of fungi strains — the most extensive in the world — to work in meeting the needs of our partners, and in the process, we drive the science of mycelium materials forward.

In the example of Forager, a brand partner might have an idea for a vegan leather jacket design using mycelium hides. Their product developers communicate their needs to our Foundry scientists, who test strain after strain in a full spectrum of conditions to quickly find the right recipe for exactly the material they need.

That new development goes towards designing a new product, but it also informs every other aspect of our work, so development in mycelium leather could also make a difference in the growth of mycelium meat. In our growing network of companies and divisions — MyForest, Forager, Mushroom Packaging — Ecovative’s Mycelium Foundry is basically the engine of their progress.

Where do you see yourself and your projects in five years’ time?

I see myself working with Ecovative to prepare for the next, even bigger phase of scaling up, alongside MyForest foods and our other divisions, Forager and Mushroom Packaging. We know that mycelium offers a better way of meeting our material needs, but for that to happen, it has to happen at scale.

“Over the next five years, mycelium will be much more common in food, in the fashion and apparel and automotive spaces”

Over the next five years, mycelium will be much more common in food, in the fashion and apparel and automotive spaces, to name a few. I think by then, many more people will see the amazing potential of mycelium, and the adoption will grow very quickly. At that point, even the amazing growth we’re experiencing right now will seem like the prologue to a period of rapid discovery and the emergence of a whole new ecosystem of mycelium materials.","Eben Bayer: “Ecovative Has Engineered Mycelium Structures That Out-Perform Plastic, Leather, Even Meat”"

For six decades Bayer Thai Co Ltd has applied its core competencies in the life science fields of healthcare and nutrition to help shape a better quality of life for all Thais.

JinA Lee, managing director of Bayer Thai and general manager of the Pharmaceuticals Division, reflects on the company's proud legacy and shares exciting future plans ahead.

""Looking back, I am proud of how far and how much Bayer Thai has achieved making lives better for our farmers, healthcare professionals, customers, partners, and communities,"" she told the Bangkok Post. ""And now, with our vision 'Health for all, hunger for none', I look forward to the future where we can deliver innovative treatments and better nutrition to transform the health of all Thais while promoting sustainable growth.""

The managing director said that all three key divisions at Bayer Thai -- pharmaceuticals, consumer health and crop science -- have lived its purpose ""Science for A Better Life"" and contributed to advancing Thailand's healthcare and agriculture sectors.

Mr Mak points out that the ultimate goal for his division is to help encourage consumers to think beyond conventional definitions of health and wellness and take control of their personal health.

- Healthy ageing -

As for the pharmaceuticals division, Ms Lee said the company's portfolio of innovative medicines addresses the unmet medical needs of Thailand's growing and ageing population by tackling difficult-to-treat medical conditions such as cancer, stroke, thrombosis and age- and diabetes-related eye diseases.

According to United Nations statistics, the average life expectancy at birth of the Thai population is now 74 years old. There was a drastic increase from 52 years old when Bayer Thai was established in 1962.

Ms Lee said that challenges that often accompany an ageing population are an increased susceptibility to chronic diseases, disability and dependency. These then contribute to a growing healthcare demand to cure many non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity, all of which have long been major health threats for seniors and represent a significant burden on the national health system.

As a result, Bayer has used cutting-edge technologies to implement several innovative therapies for cardiovascular diseases and the long-term prevention of stroke, heart attack and other serious cardiovascular events.

The company also focuses its scientific research on eye diseases due to ageing and diabetes as well as therapies on several types of cancers that have impacted upon Thai patients, including liver cancer, colorectal cancer and prostate cancer. The company's radiology solutions provide physicians with enhanced diagnostic accuracy so that treatments can be applied earlier and more effectively.

In addition to the ageing population, Bayer pays close attention to women's health and prides itself as a pioneer in contraception and gynecology, including endometriosis.

Ms Lee explained why Bayer is committed to addressing the needs of patients and physicians.

""Better treatments and improved survival mean people live longer and healthier, enabling them to return to their usual daily routines, resume work and spend their times with their families,"" she said.

Bayer Thai is ranked among the top 10 best performing multinational pharmaceutical companies in the kingdom.

Mr Weraphon explains that Bayer aims to help uplift the overall status of smallholder farmers who play an important role in addressing the challenges of food security.

- Taking charge of personal health -

""The pandemic has caused consumers to think differently about our health. The importance of being healthy has never been more apparent. We have seen that people are increasingly health-conscious and aware of the impact of individual lifestyle choices on their health and the health of others,"" said Thai Peng Mak, general manager of Bayer Thai's consumer health division for Thailand, Myanmar, Laos and Cambodia.

As a life science company, Bayer uses science to empower people to manage their health needs and take care of their personal health from its products. The Consumer Health product portfolio in Thailand includes non-prescription products (over the counter) in the areas of dermatology, nutritional and allergy. ""For example, our Bepanthen brand has helped parents to take care of their kids for more than 75 years globally and 19 years in Thailand,"" he said. ""We are working to make personal health more effective, more sustainable, more accessible, and well, more personal.""

Mr Mak added that the goal for his division is to ""empower the transformation of everyday health"". This is to help encourage consumers to think beyond conventional definitions of health and wellness and take control of their personal health -- whatever that might look like.

Bayer Thai not only provides products over the counter and online from its official stores, but also resources and knowledge about how to improve everyday health to consumers. Helpful information and learning tools are available through Bayer Thai product brand websites and Facebook accounts.

""We combine scientific expertise with world-class brands and adapt to changing consumer needs and societal trends. That's why Thai consumers have confidence in our products and continue to support us,"" said Mr Mak.

The recent donation of Bepanthen Sensiderm is part of Bayer Thai's goal to make a positive impact on society and consumers.

- Hunger for none -

In addition to using medication to maintain one's health, diet and proper nutrition are also crucial factors attributing to a better quality of life. Bayer Crop Science division focuses on seeds, crop protection, and non-agricultural pest control products.

Weraphon Charoenpanit, country commercial lead of the crop science division for Thailand, Cambodia and Myanmar, said the company contributes greatly to innovations that will help increase agricultural productivity with quality and efficiency. With changing climate conditions, drought and floods are factors farmers cannot control, said Mr Weraphon.

""Farming needs to transform through the use of both innovation and agricultural technology to provide farmers with good agricultural products,"" he said. ""Bayer improves opportunities for both large and smallholder farmers to access those technologies and processes, which include precision agriculture using drones to spray chemicals, as well as guiding farmers through the Bay GAP [good agricultural practice] programme,"" he said.

Mr Weraphon explained that the Bay GAP is Bayer's training programme aiming to transfer the most relevant knowledge to farmers and get them ready to pass the Thai GAP assessment. This also helps promote the competitiveness of Thai farmers in the export market and enhance the safety of farmers and users.

- Innovation in agriculture -

Bayer Thai has a production site in Bangpoo Industrial Estate, Samut Prakan, which houses various formulation lines and filling lines for Bayer products such as crop protection and environmental science products. The company also has a research centre in Suphan Buri. The Agri-Solution Research Center focuses on improving food production.

Bayer Thai has four additional high-quality seed production sites to provide agricultural solutions for domestic and export markets.

These include production sites in Phitsanulok for corn seeds for animals under the DeKalb brand, while the Khon Kaen and Sakon Nakhon locations focus on agricultural vegetable seeds including tomato, pepper and eggplant under the Seminis and De Ruiter brands. There is also a Chiang Rai research centre for vegetable seeds.

- Compassion drives sustainable growth -

When asked what drives Bayer Thai's breakthrough development and high performance over the past six decades, especially over the past two years when many people's health has been at risk because of the raging pandemic, Ms Lee said the key lies in the compassion and investment that the company puts into its employees and Thai society.

""Our top priority has always been the safety and well-being of our employees. We set strong measures to protect our employees as well as our customers during the pandemic,"" Ms Lee said.

As a good corporate citizen, Bayer Thai's social commitment is illustrated by our sustainability-oriented activities in the areas of science, education, health, social needs and community projects implemented in Thailand.

Better Science for Better Life project to promote science learning.

- Covid-19 relief efforts -

Bayer Thai's Pharmaceuticals Division donated a total of 2 million baht at the height of the pandemic in 2020 to frontline healthcare professionals and four hospitals through its NGO partners -- Ramathibodi Hospital, King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Siriraj Hospital and Thammasat University Field Hospital -- to help them procure essential medical supplies and personal protective equipment.

As for the Consumer Health division, Bayer Thai donated an anti-itch and skin-soothing Bepanthen Sensiderm cream to healthcare professionals experiencing skin reactions from long hours of wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) and frequent use of hand hygiene and sanitiser.

Through the ""Better Farms, Better Lives"" initiative by Bayer Thai's Crop Science division, 20 million baht's worth of starter kits including PPE, crop protection products and related training were provided to 50,000 smallholder farmers along the Chao Phraya River Basin in Pathum Thani, Suphan Buri, Phitsanulok as well as nearby areas in 26 provinces.

Ms Lee says that all three key divisions at Bayer Thai – pharmaceuticals, consumer health, and crop science – have demonstrated strong scientific leadership and play a major role in advancing Thailand's healthcare and agriculture sectors.

Bangpoo Product Supply Site provided its monetary support to the Thai Red Cross Rehabilitation Center Sawangkaniwas in Samut Prakan province where its product supply site operates.

In addition to Covid-19 relief efforts, the company continues its ongoing societal engagement activities in the areas of science and health. Through its partnership with the National Science Museum, the Better Science for Better Life project has been implemented since 2008 in order to support and encourage science learning targeted at young students.

Recently, Bayer Thai collaborated with the Planned Parenthood Association of Thailand (PPAT) and organised digital educational activities on social media platforms. The initiative creates an inclusive and comfortable atmosphere for teenagers to ask as well as learn accurate information about reproductive health and proper family planning from medical experts.

- Future innovation -

Ms Lee summarised the importance and goals of Bayer Thai's operations, especially during these trying times.

""We ensure our medicines are available for patients who count on us. We ensure our self-care solutions to keep consumers healthy when it was needed most, and we ensure sufficient agricultural supplies to help with food security,"" she said.

Ms Lee said that all three divisions -- pharmaceuticals, consumer health and crop science -- of Bayer Thai have proven their agility and resilience to adapt to a new way of working to meet customer demand as the company embarked on a digital journey to transform its capability to engage with its stakeholders, healthcare professionals, patients, farmers and customers.

""Our activities have been shifted from on-group to online. Examples can be seen from our social media platforms as well as e-commerce platforms. The pandemic has accelerated a number of trends, meaning that we need to execute our strategy and implement it at a faster pace,"" she said.

""We are determined to continue delivering innovations in areas of healthcare and nutrition to help achieve a better life for the Thai people. All these won't be possible without the commitment and dedication of all our employees whom we are all very proud of.

Each will serve a cluster of roughly 5 neighboring villages, aiming to support over 60 villages and 1500 farmers across four locations: Nilwandi, Sonewadi, Sawargaon and Umberkhed.

Bayer and PI Industries launched their 'Plastic Waste Take Back' Pilot Project today, in collaboration with Sahyadri Farms. Recykal's technology-driven initiative aims to reduce the environmental impact of farm-based plastic through proper plastic waste collection and recycling.

About ‘Plastic Waste Take Back’ Pilot Project:

This Pilot Project will accelerate sustainability in agriculture and involves the setting up of 12 Empty Container Collection Bins (ECCB) across Nashik, Maharashtra. Each will serve a cluster of roughly 5 neighboring villages, aiming to support over 60 villages and 1500 farmers across four locations: Nilwandi, Sonewadi, Sawargaon and Umberkhed.

This is a joint initiative with a leading integrated agrichemicals solution company, PI Industries. Sahyadri Farms will mobilize the farmers through its local presence and Recykal, via apps will mobilize stakeholder actions and provide cloud-based solutions for waste management. It will facilitate the collection, recycling and incineration of non-recyclable plastic waste. Together, Bayer and PI Industries will connect the link between Recykal and FPOs and financially sponsor the overall project management.

The project will facilitate waste collection in Nashik and will further be expanded to cities across India through increased awareness, education and dedicated infrastructure needed to bring about behavioral shift amongst farmers and promote safe waste disposal. Sahyadri farms will also assist in aligning with cluster farms, maintaining the access database, identifying the space for ECCB installation and helping create awareness.

Speaking on the initiative, Simon Thorsten Wiebusch, Executive Director, Bayer CropScience Ltd. said, “To address agriculture’s pressing challenges, such as its environmental impact and the rising issue of plastic waste management, partnerships with like-minded stakeholders are critical. Driven with the support of partners across the ecosystem, our ‘Plastic Waste Take Back’ Pilot Project fosters a common goal of preventing post-consumer plastic waste from going to landfills by digitally connecting waste generators, waste processors and recyclers. Through this collaborative effort, we at Bayer, look forward to creating a sustainable agricultural ecosystem, free of plastic waste across the country.”

“We are excited to collaborate with our partners with a single aim to shape a more sustainable and inclusive world through responsible waste management. By engaging teams at the grassroots level, our ‘Plastic Waste Take Back’ Pilot Project aims to contribute to and accelerate the transition to a circular plastics economy. We at PI Industries, look ahead to making big achievements through united efforts of our partners, meaningful actions and consistent progress,” said Prashant Hegde, CEO, PI Industries.

Vilas Shinde, Managing Director, Sahyadri Farmers Producer Company Ltd. Said, “As a farming community, it is our prime responsibility to efficiently plan for sustainability in farms. Every individual needs to treat all kinds of ‘waste’ including plastic as a value. A value that could be environmentally encashed for the betterment of the planet. Appropriate disposal of plastic will not only help us to manage ecosystem balance but also prove to be an effective tool to comply with Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) norms.”

Single-use plastics are the most common type of plastic found in landfills and among the most difficult to recycle. India has a major issue with plastic waste. 9.25 million tonnes of plastic enter the waste stream, with 60% of that waste recycled and 40% ending up in landfills. With discarded agricultural waste causing significant environmental damage and endangering oceanic life, proper waste disposal and recycling practices must be established.",Bayer & PI Industries Launches ‘Plastic Waste Take Back’ Pilot Project with Sahyadri Farms

The last decade has seen significant climate variability, and most climate models suggest more of the same.

Add in changing consumer habits, regulation, environment and carbon commitments, and there is much for farmers to ponder right now.

Advances in breeding and equipment will undoubtedly help, but digital tools could have a significant role too. That is why David Fuller and Tom Hoggan, of McGregor Farms, Coldstream Mains, are trialling Bayer’s Climate FieldView platform.

Their view is that future proofing the farm will be a combination of improving productivity on the better bits of land and utilising poor ground for other means. But making those decisions requires seams of data covering several seasons.

“You just can’t make decisions on one or two seasons. We need to build up a picture so that we can pinpoint areas for profitable crop production and how we can improve crop performance further. We also need to evaluate how we use poorer land more effectively. There is little point in putting a crop in the ground if growing costs exceed those that it generates,” pointed out David.

Improving crop performance further is something both David and Tom want to do. As early adopters of precision farming strategies, soil conductivity testing mapped soil zones, which led to variable rate seed, nutrition and liming, it had paid dividends for them.

Both believe this can be refined further. “We want to use the platform to look in detail at how we can improve this further. An issue across some of our land is moisture retention and we suspect our seed rates in these areas need to be a little higher. We’re probably not talking of significant gains but when added together they could be,” said David.

Where a program like Climate FieldView fits in is analysing those results. They like the ease of which data can be interpreted and the exactness the platform brings.

Last season they started a two-year trial comparing different OSR sclerotinia strategies. First year results didn’t reveal significant differences with disease pressure capped, but it did reveal the potential of Climate FieldView data capture.

“Whether you’re in the combine or the tractor you know exactly where you are. It makes evaluating on-farm trials precise and the same is true in data interpretation,"" he added.

""We used the split screen functionality of the platform to compare the harvest results precisely for each plot. It makes the task of comparing different treatments simpler.”

This is a great asset when looking at variable seed rates. With Climate FieldView selecting any field area is relatively straight forward as there is a menu of selection options including ‘click to shape’ polygon and freehand drawing tools. Using the cab app is even simpler as reports can be generated by just tapping a zone.

“We can pull out areas of the field where we have applied variable seed or nutrition rates and compare that against yield. It takes out any ambiguity when comparing variable rate applications,” they agreed.

Field health maps provide further insight for David and Tom. These show biomass on a broadly weekly basis. “We’re only at the beginning of our Climate FieldView evaluation and we can probably make more use of these field health tools this season. We’ve lost some detail to cloud cover, but they could highlight some issues during the season and are particularly valuable with variable rate nutrition.”

Despite still being on the learning curve with the platform, David has given access to various members of the management team, including the farm secretary.

“We’ve got various bits of data from various sources. Being able to share the data that the platform has captured will help Tom and myself relay information across the business. As we gain experience, we’ll do more with it,” he said.

Set up process wasn’t completely painless as there were some issues with their Agrafac sprayer, but David said that this had to be expected. “We’re looking at something new here and there was bound to be some teething problems. We’ve had set up issues with data capture and software products.

“What’s more important is the bigger picture. As we build our data it will be easier to see underlying issues restricting crop potential, and trial how we overcome these. We are keen exponents of YEN and this has highlighted that improvements can be achieved.

""But there is still plenty to be learnt here in the goal of closing the gap between actual crop yields and genetic potential. The FieldView platform will certainly enable us to monitor crops throughout the growing season better along with accurate measurement of crop performance from our trial plots.”

Bayer is extending its trial of the platform and the company’s Max Dafforn said that Scottish growers should evaluate its potential for themselves.

“A small number of prominent Scottish growers are trialling Climate FieldView across a variety of cereal and vegetable crops. But we hope to expand this so would be interested in hearing from anyone wanting to evaluate the platform on their farm.”

He said it had already paid dividends for many users. “One advantage of Climate FieldView is that you can access realtime data and don’t need to be in the combine or farm office to see it. A number of growers have already tweaked farm management practices this season. This has primarily been amended variety choices and drilling strategies.

“The platform allows for informed decisions to be made almost immediately. These gains have typically been small steps, but a 0.4t/ha gain in winter wheat yields adds up across farm area. It highlights the potential of what high quality, instant data can offer,” he noted.

Climate FieldView – A snapshot

The FieldView drive collects data from the combine, sprayer or tractor diagnostic port, with climate and field health information captured by satellites. This is held in a cloud-based FieldView account which can be accessed by anyone given authorisation via phone, iPad or farm computer.

The drive doesn’t just capture fundamentals such as yield, moisture, variety and application rates but also operation speed and location.

The field health suite tools provide in season insight covering crop biomass, rainfall and water usage, and satellite data which can be viewed as scouting, vegetation or true colour images. When creating a FieldView account historic field data is automatically uploaded from the previous four years.

Developed in the US by a Silicon Valley start-up, its potential in agriculture soon became obvious and the platform has seen significant growth since its launch in 2015.

In the US, some 49m ha of cropping area is managed with the aid of the platform and it is now a global agricultural support tool. In Europe, uptake has been rapid, being used in 15 countries, covering across 2m ha.",Bayer’s Climate FieldView platform – making farming decisions with one eye in the cloud

The idea was begun in late 2021 when Beiersdorf announced working to produce more sustainable cosmetics packaging using certified renewable polypropylene (PP) from global petrochemicals manufacturer SABIC’s TRUCIRCLE portfolio to replace fossil-based virgin plastic.

""We are proud to be a pioneer among our industry in the field of renewable plastic packaging,” says Jean-François Pascal, VP corporate sustainability at Beiersdorf. “The ambitious targets we have set ourselves with our Care Beyond Skin Sustainability Agenda are being put into practice with a great deal of commitment and hard work.""

Beiersdorf

The project began with a comprehensive analysis of the market for alternative plastics. Material requirements were stringent.

""Our excellent skin care products obviously include a high-quality packaging, which has to fulfill many requirements,"" says Michael Becker, head of global packaging development at Beiersdorf. ""On the one hand, this concerns visual and tactile features that our Nivea consumers are acquainted to, but packaging recyclability is also an important aspect for us in line with our vision of a circular economy that we aim to support.""

Another essential criterion in the selection of the raw material and the supplier was that the ""feedstock concept"", which for the Nivea Naturally Good face care packaging is based on a second-generation raw material: tall oil. Producing a cosmetic packaging from sugar cane or corn and thus using a source of food had been out of the question. ""The certified renewable plastic we source from Sabic has no visual effects or other adverse properties,” explains Hannah Rasel, Beiersdorf senior packaging specialist. “The jar made of renewable PP is neither visually nor haptically distinguishable from the previous packaging. In addition, SABIC pursues a holistic sustainability approach with its feedstock concept.”

Sustainable supplier.

Beiersdorf has also taken a new approach to the sourcing of the packaging concept, according to Isabel Hochges, Beiersdorf's chief procurement officer. ""We are now getting involved much earlier and deeper in the supply chain, where we are building new supplier relationships. Becoming more sustainable as a company also means driving the development of new materials along the value chain. We are going beyond our existing supplier relationships and bringing upstream suppliers together with our tier 1 suppliers to accelerate the transformation of our packaging materials towards sustainability.""

After identifying Sabic as a source, Beiersdorf connected the vendor with long-time trusted partner Berry Global to help speed the packaging changeover.

The result drove a rapid market introduction: The project took just nine months from idea to implementation.

“We need these strong partnerships along the value chain and are very pleased that we were able to establish such a good cooperation with our suppliers Berry Global and SABIC,"" explains Julia Wiedemann, global category manager sustainable packaging in procurement, Beiersdorf.

Achieving mass balance.

The packaging launch is based on the principle of mass balancing, in accordance with the International Sustainability & Carbon Certification (ISCC PLUS) scheme. The raw material base for the renewable plastic is certified renewable tall oil, which is a “second generation” feedstock and by-product of the forestry-industry. It seamlessly replaces crude oil in the manufacturing process — without the need to establish a separate production process.

Converting the packaging to renewable plastic not only has the advantage of conserving fossil resources, but also reduces carbon dioxide emissions. Approximately 76g of CO2 emissions are saved per jar produced, a reduction of around 60% compared to the fossil-based jar. The project therefore also contributes to the company's climate target of reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 30% absolutely across the entire value chain (Scope 1-3) by 2025. Any remaining emissions that cannot be avoided or further reduced during the manufacturing of the product are, for the first time, climate-neutralized via carbon offsetting through afforestation projects. This is new step for Beiersdorf and its largest skin care brand.

Back in March 2020, long-standing previous chairman of the board at Beiersdorf Stefan De Loecker said climate change was “one of the greatest challenges of our time”​​ and pledged that the company would continue its sharp focus on addressing this. The company reiterated this position in its H2 2021 earnings, outlining the goal to transform Beiersdorf’s global production network to climate-neutral by 2030​.

The latest rollout of eco-valves and PCR aluminium cans formed part of this.

Patented eco-valve reduces GHG emissions​

Working with UK eco-valve specialist Salford Valve Company, Beiersdorf had integrated a “climate-friendlier aerosol valve system”​ for its Nivea EcoDeo line that it said ensured a higher yield per can resulting in a significant reduction in GHG emissions. The patented Salvalco eco-valve used eco-friendlier, inert cases such as nitrogen as a propellent for the aerosol sprays instead of conventional hydrocarbon propellants.

“As a result of a strong collaboration following the venture capital investment by Oscar&Paul Beiersdorf Venture Capital in 2020, Nivea is the first global brand to use this patented, climate-friendlier aerosol valve – taking the lead in its industry,”​ Beiersdorf said.

Michael Becker, head of global packaging R&D at Beiersdorf, said: “We share the vision of a climate-positive future with our partners at Salvaco and are excited to deliver now more climate-friendly aerosol products to our consumers.”​

Post-consumer recycled aluminium cans ​

Beiersdorf had also partnered with Swiss packaging specialist Nussbaum Matzingen to roll out 100% post-consumer recycled (PCR) aluminium cans across its Nivea Men deodorant ranges and most of the Nivea Men shaving gels in Europe. The new cans reduced CO2 emissions by 28% for the deodorant line and slashed emissions by 35% for the shaving gel line given recycled aluminium required around 95% less energy during production.

The cans, which had also been light-weighted, were now available in Germany and penned for a wider European rollout in 2022.

Markus Tomasini, CTO of the Nussbaum Group, said 100% of the primary aluminium had been replaced using drink can scrap as a starting material. “Tool and process innovation were the key to being able to process the high alloy content in the post-consumer recycled material,” ​Tomasini said.

Climate-neutral goals – packaging investments key​

Jean-François Pascal, vice president of corporate sustainability at Beiersdorf, said the company was “delighted and proud” ​with its latest two packaging partnerships aimed at accelerating Beiersdorf’s transformation towards a “climate-positive future”.​

“With these kinds of partnerships, we can take serious steps on our sustainability journey,” ​Pascal said.

Earlier this year in April, Beiersdorf also launched ‘climate neutralised’ renewable plastic jars​ across its Nivea Naturally Good face care range that it had co-developed with Saudi Arabian chemicals major Sabic. The jars rolled out worldwide in June, this year.

Beiersdorf had also been collaborating with manufacturing major Werner & Mertz and R&D institute The Fraunhofer Institute for Process Engineering and Packaging (IVV) for some time to co-publish a guidance document on the suitability of post-consumer recyclates in cosmetic grade packaging.

Beiersdorf had been working with WWF since 2018 in the western Indonesian province Kapuas Hulu District where it had founded a smallholders’ association ‘Mitra Bersama’ to spearhead plans for RSPO certification. The latest four-year extended commitment between Beiersdorf, Evonik and WWF now aimed to ensure all 200 members of this association, who jointly owned around 300 hectares of land, were certified according to RSPO standards before June 2026. Another goal of the commitment was to give these smallholders direct market access to a palm oil mill.

Connecting with Indonesian smallholders​

Longer-term, Beiersdorf and Evonik wanted to source palm (kernel) oil derivatives for products directly from this region, meaning certification of these smallholders represented an “important building block” ​in achieving this goal.

“Both companies have been committed for several years to the sustainable cultivation of palm oil and a transparent supply chain, and they share the target of deforestation-free sourcing,”​ Beiersdorf said.

According to the personal care major, the “first phase”​ of working with the smallholders, with the creation of an association and various training courses implemented, had laid a “solid foundation”​ for achieving the planned RSPO certification in the coming years.

In Borneo, Beiersdorf, Evonik and WWF would be working in the Indonesian part of the island, West Kalimantan, to “prevent further conversion of natural forests by promoting the cultivation of sustainable palm oil and improving the living standards of the local smallholders”​.

Silke Düwel-Rieth, head of business and markets at WWF Germany, described the extended cooperation as “exceptional” ​because it combined “transformative corporate objectives with local nature conservation”.​

“Together, we are strengthening sustainable palm oil production to preserve healthy, species-rich forest systems,”​ Düwel-Rieth said.

Palm oil, Indonesia and beauty​

According to Statistica, global consumption of palm oil sat at around 75 million tons in 2022, with Indonesia representing the largest producing country with over 40 million tons produced. The cosmetic, pharmaceutical, detergent and cleaning industries accounted for around 20% of this palm oil consumption last year.

But Beiersdorf said that, for the cosmetics industry, it wasn’t palm (kernel) oil directly that was being processed, rather so-called palm (kernel) oil derivatives – used as surfactants for foaming or as emulsifiers for a smoothing effect. The personal care major, for example, used around 30,000 metric tons of derivatives per year in the manufacture of its skin and body care products, including its Nivea and Eucerin brands.

However, since 2020, the company had been sourcing palm (kernel) oil derivatives entirely as RSPO Mass Balance certified (RSPO Certified Sustainable Palm Oil from certified sources that is mixed with ordinary palm oil throughout the supply chain) and had a the target of sourcing all palm-based raw materials deforestation-free by 2025 – part of its wider ‘Care Beyond Skin’ sustainability agenda.

Last year, Borneo-based wild harvest ingredient supplier Forestwise called on all international beauty brands to support local communities​ on the island and empower them to protect the remaining forests and wildlife it shelters. In 2021, WWF said it was certainly time for big beauty to “galvanise”​ rising consumer engagement​ around sustainability.",‘Deforestation-free sourcing’: Beiersdorf and WWF extend joint commitment on sustainable palm oil

A spotlight on Europe's 'leading position' Corporations in Europe represented 44% of the 330+ global A list, with eight out of the top 12 triple A status companies based in Europe. CDP said this reflected “Europe’s leading position for the highest levels of transparency and action across the three key interrelated environmental themes” ​– increasingly relevant after the EU Parliament’s adoption of the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD)​​ in November 2022, that came into force last week on January 5, 2023. The European Commission (EC) would adopt the first CSRD standards mid-2023​, with rules set to apply from January 2024, requiring all large companies in the EU (250-500+ employees), as well as listed SMEs, to disclose data, subject to independent auditing and certification, on the impact of their activities on people and the planet and any sustainability risks they were exposed to. Digital access to sustainability information also had to be guaranteed. Maxfield Weiss, executive director of CDP Europe, said: “With the EU’s ground-breaking new reporting regulation, the CSRD, now agreed, CDP A List companies are showing they are ahead of the game – taking clear action to reduce emissions and to address environmental impacts throughout their value chains. This is the type of environmental transparency and action we need economy-wide to prevent ecological collapse.”​ All European A-List companies would be recognised at the 2023 CDP Europe Awards in February this year, due to be held at the Fondation Louis Vuitton in Paris.

Beauty holds five out of 12 ‘Triple A’ spots​

Out of the 12 companies with three ‘A’ scores in the 2022 ranking, five worked in the beauty and personal care industry – either manufacturing finished products or supplying fragrances, with four headquartered in Europe.

Personal care major Beiersdorf; fragrance major Firmenich; personal care giant Kao Corporation; international beauty major L’Oréal; and global luxury goods giant LVMH all secured A scores for sustainable efforts across climate change, forests and water security. And many more companies operating in beauty and personal care received one or two A scores across categories.

The other seven companies with triple A rankings for 2022 were food giant Danone; tech hardware company HP Inc; Brazilian paper manufacturer and recycling firm Klabin S.A; wood-based fibre supplier Lenzing AG; European paperboard supplier Metsä Board Corporation; cigarette company Philip Morris International; and Finnish paper mill and forest firm UPM-Kymmene Corporation.

Vincent Warnery, CEO of Beiersdorf, said: “We are very proud to be recognised on CDP’s Triple A List for 2022, an achievement that stands for our serious commitment to drive sustainability and lead by example. Beiersdorf has a deeply-rooted motivation to strive for environmental stewardship and help tackle three of the greatest challenges of our time, which are closely interlinked: climate change, deforestation and water security.”​

Warnery said Beiersdorf hoped to inspire others in this endeavour, which started with environmental disclosure, required a true transformation, and ultimately relied on a collaborative effort.

Collaboration – manufacturers, suppliers and scientific partners​

Antoine Arnault, director of image and environment at LVMH, agreed on the importance of collaboration. “LVMH would like to share this recognition with its suppliers and scientific partners. Measuring and communicating environmental impact across the LVMH value chain on climate, water and biodiversity – including forests – have proved to be powerful tools for fostering actions,”​ Arnault said.

And given the company’s “deep dependency”​ on biodiversity, he said LVMH was particularly committed to scaling up regenerative practices within its supply chain that bridged the perseveration of biodiversity and the fight against climate change.

Nicolas Hieronimus, CEO of L’Oréal, said his company also had big plans in place to continue environmental efforts, collaboratively. “We want to leverage our scale to become a catalyst of change and mobilise all parts of our ecosystem to address the pressing climate and environmental challenges we all face. By working together, we can create the beauty that moves the world,”​ Hieronimus said.

This year’s CDP ranking marked the seventh year in a row that L’Oréal had received a Triple A rating – the only company to do so and a “testimony of L’Oréal’s long-term commitment​” to the planet, the CEO said.

Dave Muenz, director and managing executive officer in charge of Kao’s ESG division, said: “Being included in this selection reassures us that we are taking the right steps to realise a sustainable lifestyle for each and every consumer. We must all take certain and urgent action across society to tackle climate change.”​

As the only fragrance supplier to achieve a Triple A CDP ranking, and 2022 marking the fifth consecutive year of such a ranking, Gilbert Ghostine, CEO of Firmenich, said it was testimony to the 11,000 colleagues who had strived to deliver ambitious Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) targets for climate and nature.

“Sustainability and good business are synonymous: our journey demonstrates that businesses can drive urgently needed change for the planet and we are determined to keep on raising the bar,”​ Ghostine said.

CDP warning – just 1.3% of companies at ‘Triple A’ level​

Whilst 2022 had seen plenty of progress, the CDP said the 330+ companies, collectively worth almost €10.2 trillion, and recognised as global leaders in environmental transparency and action with ‘Triple A’ scores, represented just 1.3% of the 900+ companies required to disclose against all three CDP areas.

Whilst 280+ companies scored an A for climate change disclosures, up 34% on last year despite more stringent requirements, progress remained slow on deforestation and water security, according to CDP.

Dexter Galvin, global director of corporations and supply chains at CDP, said: “In a year of ever-increasing environmental concerns around the world, the need for transformational, urgent and collaborative change is more critical than ever. Environmental disclosure is the first vital step towards a net-zero and nature-positive future, so A List companies should be commended for the level of transparency in their CDP responses.”​

“But we cannot ignore that these companies are in the minority,” ​Galvin said. “Most are still not managing all environmental issues holistically, and far too many are remaining complacent or failing to respond at all. Companies must step up to the challenge as CDP continues to lift the bar for what qualifies as environmental leadership, and since there is no route to ​1.5 °C without nature, they must speed and scale up their progress in addressing deforestation and water impacts, dependencies and risks, too,” ​he said.","Beiersdorf, Firmenich, Kao, L’Oréal, LVMH secure ‘Triple A’ CDP 2022 rating"

At the same time, Beiersdorf significantly improved the operating results (EBIT) excluding special factors to $1.27 billion versus $1.05 billion in the previous year.

“2022 was an excellent year for Beiersdorf with a remarkable result for both business segments, Consumer and Tesa,” said Vincent Warnery, CEO of Beiersdorf. “For the first time in at least two decades, we delivered double-digit organic sales growth. Our major growth and profitability drivers were well-balanced between the NIVEA business in Europe, the NIVEA business in the emerging markets, our Derma business, and our luxury business with La Prairie. I am pleased to announce that with Eucerin and Aquaphor, our Derma business achieved a major milestone three years earlier than planned with nominal sales revenue of more than one billion euros for the first time. 2022 was also a challenging year in many respects, which makes us particularly proud of this excellent outcome and the profitable growth we have achieved. Thanks to the consistent pursuit of our C.A.R.E.+ strategy and our very well-balanced business portfolio, we can press ahead into the future more securely and with confidence.”

Consumer Business Segment Records Double-Digit Rise in Organic Sales

The Consumer Business Segment recorded a double-digit rise in organic sales of 10.5%. In nominal terms, sales increased by 16.3% to $7.5 billion, compared with $6.5 billion the previous year. Favorable exchange rate and structural effects have positively impacted the nominal growth. Thanks to consistent pricing initiatives and strict cost management, Beiersdorf was able to offset a large part of the additional input costs and thus, as guided, achieved a slight margin expansion in the Consumer Segment. EBIT excluding special factors for the Consumer Business Segment climbed from $789 million to $938 million in 2022, resulting in an EBIT margin of 12.3%.

All regions and brands contributed to the growth in the Consumer Business Segment. Beiersdorf gained market share on every continent led by the NIVEA brand and the Derma business. The regions Africa/Asia/Australia (+10.2%) and Americas (23.2%) achieved strong, double-digit growth two years in a row. Additionally, there was also good sales growth in Europe (5.0%) despite the ongoing war in Eastern Europe.

The core brand NIVEA grew organically by 9.6% year on year in 2022. Both parts of the business, Skin Care and Personal Care, saw substantial growth. The strong, broad-based growth was based on gains in market share in all regions and almost all main categories. NIVEA achieved an excellent balance between pricing and volume-driven growth. Although growth from price increases was up quarter on quarter throughout the year, NIVEA reported positive volume contribution for the full year. This was mainly driven by the Emerging Markets region, and a healthy mix of growth coming from the core business and superior innovations such as the NIVEA Cellular Luminous 630 range.

The Derma brands Eucerin and Aquaphor performed particularly well, with organic sales growth of 23.9%. Nominal sales were up from $842 million to over $1 billion. Strong growth acceleration was achieved in all categories and regions, especially in the key market USA as well as in Latin America, and in China. The Eucerin face care category and in particular the subcategories anti-pigment and acne were key growth drivers, supported by the further expansion of the successful Thiamidol range. In addition, the sun category contributed to strong above-average growth, supported by the launch of Eucerin Sun in the USA and the success of new product launches. Furthermore, the ecommerce business grew impressively by 29%.

Beiersdorf’s luxury brand La Prairie increased its organic sales by 1.9%. Nominal sales were up from $638 million to $698 million. This growth was mainly due to the recovery of the important travel retail business and the upturn in brick-and-mortar retail in North America. The local market in China, on the other hand, faced major challenges due to COVID-19 restrictions. Sales in European countries continued to recover and the most recent launch, Skin Caviar Harmony, showed excellent results across all markets.

Tesa Achieves Impressive Sales Revenue

Tesa achieved impressive sales revenue of $1.8 billion in 2022, an increase from 1.59 billion the previous year, despite a difficult global market environment. This represents a nominal increase of 11.3% and an organic increase of 8.8%. Sales in the Tesa Industry division increased considerably by 10.0%. Alongside successful project business in consumer electronics and the recovery in automotive markets, price increases contributed significantly to this trend and helped offset most of the significant input cost increases.

The Tesa Consumer division grew organically by 5.1% in a declining market due to innovative products and price increases. In 2022, Tesa continued to invest in its strategic pillars of innovation, sustainability, and digital in order to prepare the business for future growth. This resulted in a slight slowdown in the EBIT margin excluding special factors by 20bps. EBIT excluding special factors for the tesa Business Segment increased to a total of $296 million compared with $269.8 million the previous year), resulting in an EBIT margin of 16.7% compared to 16.9% the previous year.

C.A.R.E.+ Strategy

In 2022, Beiersdorf continued to put considerable effort into realizing its sustainability goals as part of the Care Beyond Skin sustainability agenda, and it made significant progress towards its climate targets. The company has set an ambitious climate target of reducing absolute Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions by 30% by 2025 versus the base year 2018. In 2022, the company reduced its absolute Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions by 17%. Beiersdorf has recently been awarded a triple-A rating by Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), a non-profit organization, as one of only 13 companies worldwide. CDP recognized Beiersdorf for its efforts to protect the climate, water, and forests with the top rating of “A”.

Beiersdorf further strengthened its market positions worldwide by tapping into new white spots. In 2022, the company entered the world’s largest sun care market, the USA, with Eucerin Sun products. Following the acquisition of the premium skin care brand Chantecaille, Beiersdorf wants to further accelerate its growth in the prestige cosmetics segment. In addition, Beiersdorf acquired a majority stake in S-Biomedic, thereby strengthening its expertise in the field of acne treatment and skin microbiome research.

Following preparations at the end of 2022, Beiersdorf acquired all shares in its Indonesian affiliate P.T. Beiersdorf Indonesia at the beginning of the year.

Can a moisturizer combat climate change? Can a moisturizer combat climate change?





Beiersdorf has launched Nivea Men Climate Care moisturizer featuring an ingredient obtained from recycled carbon dioxide. This is made possible by the carbon capture and utilization (CCU) process, which is an ultramodern method for making use of carbon, according to Beiersdorf. The CO2-recycling technology comprises multiple steps. First, the carbon dioxide is collected at locations such as industrial chimneys and diverted to a bioreactor, where it is then fermented and processed into a cosmetic ethanol. Ethanol is used in numerous cosmetic products. Nivea Men Climate Care Moisturizer has a soothing effect on the skin and adds a refreshing moisture boost.The moisturizer contains 14% ethanol that has been obtained through alternative methods. Moreover, the formula is 100% free of microplastics, silicones, mineral oils, and PEG/PEG derivatives. This men’s skin care product is climate-neutralized* and manufactured using electricity from 100% renewable sources. The formula is 99% biodegradable, with fully recyclable packaging. The Nivea Men Climate Care Moisturizer will debut in Germany in early June 2022, starting as a limited edition at drugstores and online retailers.“Our ambition is to offer consumers the highest product quality possible at all times. To make that happen, we combine our deep scientific expertise with the latest technologies such as this type of artificial photosynthesis,” says Dr. Gitta Neufang, corporate SVP-global R&D at Beiersdorf . “I am delighted that our product developers have initiated this innovative men’s skin care concept together with our partners and that they were the first in our industry to bring it to market. It is an impressive step that is bound to be followed by more developments in this direction.”Beiersdorf wants to achieve an absolute reduction of 30% of its scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions and 10% of its scope 3 emissions group-wide by 2025 (using 2018 as a basis). These targets have been recognized by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and align with the demands of scientists to limit global warming to 1.5°C.“This new men’s skin care product with the innovative CO2-recycling technology represents an important milestone for us,” says Jean-Francois Pascal, VP-sustainability/ “The ‘Climate Care’ name hits the mark very well, as our sustainability engagement goes far beyond the scope of our skin care products and puts climate action at the center of our approach.”",Beiersdorf Launches Cosmetics Product with Recycled CO2

The collaboration aimed to design a packaging solution that creates a cleaner input waste stream and finds its way back into the loop in high-value applications. It should also allow for the high-quality visuals and distinctive shapes consumers associate with cosmetics packaging and brands.

Colourless 100% PCR polyolefin bottle

To deliver on all these factors, the innovation centres on a colourless polyolefin bottle with 100% PCR [1] content, full body sleeved in a printed deinkable shrink sleeve.

To achieve full circularity, the packaging material needs to retain its optimal properties throughout multiple life cycles. Borealis therefore brought high-quality PCR to the project based on its Borcycle M technology, while Clariant offered expertise in additive solutions to ensure PCR quality and protect against polymer chain breakdown in each recycling step.

The result, according to the four companies, was a high-value PCR material repeatedly hit the high-end criteria of personal care packaging.

To achieve differentiation of the packaging despite using an uncoloured bottle, the four partners opted for a full body shrink sleeve. The bottle/shrink sleeve combination is intended for removal at a materials recovery facility. However, to increase the circularity of the solution, Siegwerk was able to provide inks designed to allow deinking of the sleeve.

Fully recyclable

Thus, all materials are technically fully recyclable with the potential to be recovered and used for the same application.

According to the four companies, first sorting trials in existing recycling infrastructure proved the sortability of the full body sleeved HDPE bottle, achieving a high recovery of the bottle’s material. Additionally, the project team conducted trials with full body sleeved, transparent PET bottles and achieved similar results.

However, further advancements in sorting technology are needed to truly give colourless bottles a second life back. “Technologies such as digital watermarking or artificial intelligence could help such sustainability goals to be reached,” conclude the four partners.","Beiersdorf, Clariant, Siegwerk and Borealis create a 100% circular bottle"

The Nivea brand owner used light-scattering pigments to create the bespoke formulation

Four-year-old Münster resident Charlotte lives with EPP

Nivea owner Beiersdorf has created a cosmetic sunscreen for a young girl living with erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP).

The rare genetic light disorder means that when skin comes into contact with the visible, coloured parts of sunlight, it causes neuropathic pain and triggers burns.

In patients, when exposed to sunlight, a precursor of the red blood pigment, protoporphyrin, is deposited in blood vessels.

Energy from visible light is absorbed and triggers a chemical reaction, which the person affected perceives as severe pain and which appears as burns on the skin.

Beiersdorf launched the project for an innovative sunscreen after the parents of four-year-old Charlotte, who lives near Münster, Germany, reached out to Beiersdorf’s Chief Scientist for Photobiology, Dr Ludger Kolbe.

Research into visible, high-energy light showed that special light-scattering pigments could be added to the sunscreen to prevent the light from penetrating the skin, allowing Charlotte to be exposed to sunlight for a short period of time.

“With the high standards of skin protection that we at Nivea pursue, we are delighted that we were able to find a special solution for Charlotte,” said Kolbe.

“With her personal sunscreen, she still has to be careful in the sun, but can spend a little longer playing outside with her friends.”

Beiersdorf stressed that the sunscreen was especially developed for Charlotte and her individual skin needs, and will therefore not be included for sale in its product portfolio.

Improving quality of life

Charlotte’s case is not the first where cosmetics industry players have put their expertise towards helping those with specific genetic conditions.

Chemicals giant BASF has produced free sunscreen specifically developed for Tanzanians with albinism to protect them from the glare of the east African sun.

And, more recently, Eurofragance worked with Sant Joan de Déu Hospital to develop fragrances that help neutralise the odour associated with trimethylaminuria.

An incurable metabolic condition where the body is unable to process certain nitrogen compounds, such as trimethylamine, trimethylaminuria results in a characteristic smell and is sometimes called ‘fish odour syndrome’.

Under the latest deal, S-Biomedic would continue to be managed as a standalone entity under Beiersdorf’s existing microbiome programme, complementing existing research activities.

“In the last few years, microbiome research has become one of the spotlight topics in science and offers unique starting points for breakthrough skin care innovations,”​ said Beiersdorf.

Managing the microbiome​

Founded in 2014, S-Biomedic was dedicated to researching the balance of the skin’s microbiome and developing active ingredients for cosmetic products. The company’s technology selected natural probiotic strains able to influence host-microbiome symbiosis and microbiota population stability. Back in February 2020, Dutch specialty ingredients major Royal DSM signed an exclusive agreement with the Belgian startup​ to develop and commercialise actives using probiotic technology to treat acne.

This was an area Beiersdorf also said its majority stake acquisition would help advance – the field of acne treatment, a condition that occurred when the skin’s natural microbiome was out of balance.

Dr Gitta Neufang, senior VP of R&D at Beiersdorf, said the acquisition was certainly a strategic fit in terms of innovation and skin care research.

“Together with the pioneers of S-Biomedic, we are taking skin care to the next level and will foster the development of solutions for unmet consumer needs,”​ Neufang said.

Jörn Hendrik Reuter, manager of the Microbiome Accelerator division at Beiersdorf, added: “The advances of S-Biomedic in biomedical research complement our own efforts in this field and open the door to develop products that work in harmony with the natural skin processes.”​

Reuter previously discussed his vision for the future of skin microbiome innovation and development during CosmeticsDesign-Europe’s Skin Microbiome webinar last year,​ which can still be watched in full, on-demand.

Veronika Oudova, CEO of S-Biomedic, said: “Our vision since 2014 when we started S-Biomedic has been to build and promote skin microbiome technologies and make them (…) the new frontier in skin health. I am very excited that together with the team we have achieved a very important milestone on that journey. By joining Beiersdorf, our novel approach has its path to consumers all over the world.”​

Skin microbiome investment and focus​

In October, this year, French-headquartered venture capital firm Seventure Partners said it would invest €300m in more than 20 cutting-edge companies next year,​ as part of a third wave of microbiome innovation funds – a move its CEO Isabelle Cremoux said aligned with interest and research activity in the field.

“The [microbiome] field has continuously gained momentum, not only in skin care but in all applications. Because, in fact, scientifically, more is being discovered in the microbiome and its role linking the microbiome composition to the immune system of a person, to the general health, and lots of diseases or health conditions,”​ Cremoux said.

Advances in technology,​ she said, had certainly driven many breakthroughs in the field thus far, and would likely continue to do so in the near future.",‘Taking skin care to the next level’: Beiersdorf acquires S-Biomedic

When multinational cosmetics company Beiersdorf AG needed sustainable paper packaging for its NIVEA skin care brand in China, it turned to Eastman. The specialty materials innovator worked with Beiersdorf and several of its suppliers to help deliver packaging that was recyclable and lighter weight with no compromises in attractiveness, quality or performance.

""Eastman collaborated with us and several of our suppliers to offer solutions across the value chain,"" said Vicky Zong, Beiersdorf's Innovation Center Shanghai packaging development leader in Shanghai. ""This is very important to us because innovative packaging solutions play a major role in our company's sustainability agenda: CARE BEYOND SKIN.""

By 2025, Beiersdorf wants to achieve 100% refillable, reusable or recyclable packaging; increase the share of recycled material in plastic packaging to 30%; and, in the same period, reduce the use of fossil-based virgin plastic by 50% (base year 2019).

The Eastman technology team worked closely with Beiersdorf and its suppliers along the value chain to qualify the new process. Eastman's cellulose esters were key in ensuring the success of the technology, which involved switching from laminated paper to film-free paper in a process called ""transfer metallization."" Transfer metallization offers very high-quality appearance and results in packaging that is still recyclable.

""In this application, our cellulose ester release coating offers better appearance, better ink adhesion and better-balanced anti-folding and anti-blocking properties than alternative solutions,"" said Eric Zhang, Eastman market development manager in Shanghai.

The process has typically been used on very specialized packaging. Commitments by companies like Beiersdorf to reach ambitious sustainability goals have led to its wider use. Already, the outer packaging of seven new NIVEA product lines have been upgraded to this recyclable solution, which also can reduce the packaging's weight by up to 10%.

""The combination of our knowledge of cellulose esters and application development support is truly unique,"" said Leslie Montgomery, Eastman's segment market manager for coatings and inks. ""Our application expertise is unparalleled and comes from more than 60 years of experience working with cellulose esters.""

""This is a solution that other brands pursuing greater sustainability can adopt,"" said Christian Derbez, Eastman's sales director for coatings and inks in the Asia Pacific region. ""The key here is that we can make a difference down the value chain and respond to a trend with real solutions that help everyone involved.""

While witnessing China's continued opening-up, German skin care company Beiersdorf has also benefited from such efforts by recording strong double-digit growth in the Chinese market over the past two decades, a speed that can be found nowhere else in the world, Ketin Lei, general manager of Corporate Affairs for Beiersdorf China said on Monday.

Lei made such comments while attending the ""In Shanghai, For the World"" show held during the ongoing fifth China International Import Expo.

The themed show aims to demonstrate Shanghai's achievements in urban construction, which is best exemplified by the expansion of many multinational companies.

""The overall business environment and favorable investment policies in Shanghai have helped the development of many foreign companies of our kind,"" said Lei.

Beiersdorf first tapped into the Chinese market in 1994 by bringing its blockbuster brand Nivea. Over time, the German company has set up three Chinese centers for production, innovation and distribution in Shanghai.

The registration mechanism for imported beauty products, which was first attempted in China (Shanghai) Pilot Free Trade Zone in 2017, has largely facilitated the development of many foreign companies like Beiersdorf, said Lei.

Under such mechanisms, ordinary imported beauty products, which do not have special effects such as whitening or sunscreen, can be sold in China shortly after setting up a record at the local administrative bodies. Prior to this, imported beauty products would go through 12 to 18 months of administrative examination in Beijing to get a final approval for sales.

The mechanism was promoted nationwide in November 2018 with the State Council's approval.

""Such institutional opening-up policies first landed in Shanghai mainly thanks to the city's well-built infrastructure, complete industrial chains, as well as the adequate supply of talents,"" said Lei.

Beiersdorf's China innovation center located in southeast Shanghai was put into use in November last year. The city's openness is one major reason for the company to make such a move, as the city's business environment will help to nurture more products only not for the Chinese market but also the rest of the world, he added.

Although Beiersdorf was not present at this year's CIIE, the company plans to take part in the exhibition next year, bringing Chantecaille products - the premium skincare and cosmetics brand that Beiersdorf acquired in late 2021, said Lei.",Beiersdorf shares how China's opening-up is beneficial for all

Sales of Nivea’s Luminous range performed particularly well, doubling in growth when compared with the same period last year

Beiersdorf’s full-year guidance remains unchanged due to the current volatility of the market

Beiersdorf has reported a double-digit sales boost for its half-year 2022 results, as sales for Nivea products soared during the period.

Nivea’s organic sales increased by 11.2% during the first six months of the year across the brand’s entire product portfolio.

The sun, lip, face and body categories were highlighted as key performers for Nivea's skin care division.

Sales of Nivea’s Luminous range also doubled when compared with the same period last year, and was the primary source of growth for the brand’s face care category.

Deodorants and shower gels saw strong demand in 2022 and were the standout products for Nivea’s personal care arm.

Group sales at Beiersdorf increased by 10.5% to €4.5 bn for the half-year period, driven by Nivea’s strong performance.

The company’s consumer business segment also reported sales of €3.6bn, an 11.7% rise compared with the first half of 2021.

“In an increasingly challenging environment, Beiersdorf carried the strong growth momentum from the start of the year into the second quarter and posted double-digit sales growth at Group level,” said Vincent Warnery, CEO of Beiersdorf.

Beiersdorf’s other major skin care player La Prairie lagged slightly with a 1.8% increase in sales during H1, affected by Covid-19 lockdowns in China during the period.

Sales were impacted by a number of Covid restrictions including PCR test requirements before entering department stores.

The Derma brands Eucerin and Aquaphor, meanwhile, had organic sales growth of 26.6% across Beiersdorf’s major geographic regions.

This included the United States and Germany, which both saw strong gains in market share and growing sales, but the company also noted a strong performance in Latin America.

Beiersdorf said the current volatility of the economic market means its full-year guidance will remain unchanged for the current time.

The company expressed its concerns around the ongoing supply disruptions, risks from potential gas shortages and inflation going into the second half of the year.

“In the second half of 2022 we expect additional headwinds from economic and political tensions, and are confirming our full-year guidance,” added Warnery.

Within this, the company’s flagship brand Nivea reported organic sales growth of 5.5% for the year – growth largely fuelled by innovation successes. Beiersdorf said the 2020 launch of its Nivea Luminous630 range had bolstered sales worldwide, particularly in Europe, with its serum and face cream formulated using a patented active ingredient to reduce pigment and age spots.

Speaking during Beiersdorf’s FY 2021 earnings call, company CFO Astrid Hermann said: “The transformation of our iconic brand is progressing well. We have made Nivea one of the fastest-growing brands in face care in the mass market.”​

‘We want to reinvent our flagship brand’​

Vincent Warnery, CEO of Beiersdorf, added that “further development”​ of the Nivea brand was a core focus for the company over the next financial year.

“We have a clearly defined goal at Nivea. We want to reinvent our flagship brand as a leading global skin care brand,”​ Warnery said.

“…I’m am convinced that the future of the brand, and the path of the brand, is much more in skin care, in face care, than in, for example, personal care.” ​Investment in Nivea shower and soap products, for example, was not a priority area for Beiersdorf in the months ahead, he said.

The 2021 appointment of Grita Loebsack as president of Nivea was one important shift in achieving such change for the brand, he said, aiming to make the business “even more global, digital and sustainable”. ​Beiersdorf was also introducing a new operating model for Nivea, following on from successes across Eucerin, La Prairie and Hansaplast.

“We are beginning to take a more global approach to product launches and marketing campaigns for Nivea ranges. We want to implement fewer but better and larger product launches and campaigns. In specific terms, this means that in the future, innovations and campaigns will generally be implemented in all markets that are relevant for us,” ​Warnery said.

And digitalisation would play a “key role” ​in these efforts, he said, as Beiersdorf worked to strengthen Nivea’s brand positioning, both offline and online, via precision marketing campaigns. Particular focus, he said, would be paid to driving brand equity in the US and China.

Expanding Luminous630 – eyes on China ​

Moving forward, the CEO said Beiersdorf would continue to build on the success of its Luminous630 anti-pigment range – the “most expensive product” ​in Nivea’s entire assortment at around €20 per SKU.

“We will expand this range in the hand care and sun care segments. And I have also a very promising launch into the eye category. Our aim is to double sales of the range this year and thereby expand growth in the face care segment and broaden our market leadership beyond Europe,”​ Warnery said.

Beiersdorf also hoped to complete registration of Nivea Luminous630’s active patented ingredient W630 in China – a move that should create “significant growth potential”​ given the country was the world’s largest face care market.

Asked by an analyst if tightened consumer budgets post-COVID might impact traction and growth of Nivea worldwide, Warnery said the company may face some issues for some of the range, but strong uptake of the Luminous630 products priced at around four-times the cost of regular Nivea moisturisers indicated consumer appetite and willingness to follow innovations. “We believe that, especially in those new categories which are the priority for the brand – face care, sun care – we have some opportunity to increase our penetration despite increased prices.”​

Nivea Soft climate-neutral launch in 2022​

Warnery said Beiersdorf would also continue to invest further in sustainable innovation across Nivea, following on from the successful launch of its first climate-neutralised product last year.​ The Nivea Naturally Good face care range had been packed in renewable plastic jars made from by-product oils from the forestry industry – a “lighthouse in the context of material reduction”, ​he said. ​The launch had proven especially successful in France, he said, where its ‘green’ status on the widely used sustainability app Yuka had been a hit with beauty consumers.

“We plan to extend our lightweight packaging approach to other assortments this year,”​ he said.

Beiersdorf would also continue working to reduce overall CO2 emissions by “revamping”​ existing and popular products, the CEO said, starting with the relaunch of Nivea Soft as a climate-neutral product later this year. The company had reformulated the product, “changing some critical ingredients”,​ he said, and worked to reduce plastic in the packaging

“…We see clearly, especially for the young targets, especially for Europe, that this appeal for sustainable products is really bringing a lot of new consumers and a much better equity to the Nivea brand.”​",Beiersdorf sets out ambition to ‘reinvent’ Nivea as leading global skin care brand

Analysts are impressed with Bayer’s previous results and are optimistic about the upcoming earnings as well. The stock also has a huge potential for growth in the future. Beiersdorf, on the other side, has mixed reviews on its stock despite higher forecasted revenues for 2022.

Here, we have used the TipRanks Earnings Calendar tool for the German market to pick these stocks with upcoming earnings. This tool guides investors with the latest information on the earnings dates of the companies, along with forecasted EPS and sales numbers.

Let’s have a look at these companies in detail.

Bayer AG

Bayer is among the world’s leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. The company has three major product areas: pharmaceuticals, consumer health, and crop science.

The company’s stock has been off to a good start in 2023 and is trading up by 20% year-to-date. Investors and analysts have welcomed the new leadership change in the company with the appointment of its new CEO, Bill Anderson.

Bayer is scheduled to report its full-year results for 2022 on February 28. According to TipRanks, the consensus EPS forecast for Q4 is €1.27 per share, slightly up from €1.26 per share in the prior year’s quarter.

Analysts are highly bullish on the earnings after the company confirmed its full-year guidance numbers in the previous financial update. For 2022, the company expects its sales to be around €47 billion and an EBITDA margin of 26%-27% on a currency-adjusted basis. The company also expects a growth of 10% for its seed and crop protection segment, driven by higher prices. The full-year EPS is forecasted to be around €7.30 per share.

Is Bayer AG a Good Stock to Buy?

Ahead of its earnings, analysts remain highly bullish on the stock and have reiterated their Buy ratings. UBS analyst Michael Leuchten has the highest target price on the stock at €99.0, suggesting an upside of 67.3% from the current levels.

According to TipRanks’ rating consensus, BAYN stock has a Strong Buy rating.

The average price forecast for the stock is €75.92, which shows a change of 28.3% from the current price.

Beiersdorf AG

Beiersdorf is a German manufacturing company known for brands like Nivea, Eucerin, and Hansaplast. The business specializes in personal care and self-adhesive products.

The company will report its Q4 results and annual report for 2022 on March 1. The consensus EPS forecast is €1.15 per share for the fourth quarter, as compared to EPS of €1.17 per share in Q4 2021. The forecasted sales for this quarter are €2.09 billion. The sales for the first nine months of 2022 were €6.7 billion.

Considering its strong performance in the third quarter, Beiersdorf raised its full-year numbers. The company now expects higher sales for its consumer and tesa segments. Overall, group sales are expected to grow by 9%–10% in 2022.

Beiersdorf Stock Price Forecast

The stock has mixed opinions from analysts, with a majority of Buy ratings. On TipRanks, BEI stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating, which includes seven Buy, six Hold, and one Sell recommendations.

The stock price forecast is €112.08, which is slightly lower than the current trading price.

Conclusion

Among these two companies, Bayer makes an attractive case for investment considering the upside potential in the stock. Analysts also remain bullish on the long-term prospects of the company, driven by its upcoming drug pipeline.

Meanwhile, analysts see limited growth in Beiersdorf stock at the moment as they await the company’s outlook for 2023 in the upcoming results.

This week, there was a last-minute addition to the list when the German conglomerate Beiersdorf AG acquired the family-owned, 25-year-old beauty brand Chantecaille for an undisclosed sum. Beiersdorf valued Chantecaille at around $590 million and expects Chantecaille to make $100 million in sales this year.

For Beiersdorf, the acquisition fills a notable gap in its portfolio. While it owns many mid-range beauty and skin-care brands, including Nivea and Eucerin, it’s lacking in luxury brands, with only skin-care brand La Prairie among its luxe offerings. Chantecaille is a prestige brand with a higher price range — its lifting masks go for $165 — that will expand Beiersdorf’s high-end skin-care roster. Aside from Bieresdorf, P&G has sought to develop a prestige category with the acquisition of Farmacy skin care in November and Ouai hair care in December.

“Through the acquisition of Chantecaille, we are bolstering our portfolio in prestige beauty and strengthening our position, especially in the United States, China and Korea, which is a priority of our C.A.R.E.+ strategy,” said Vincent Warnery, CEO of Beiersdorf, in an emailed press statement. C.A.R.E.+, standing for courage, aspiration, responsibility and empathy, is a company-wide strategy that was implemented in 2019 to invest in new categories and areas, and fill gaps in Beiersdorf’s portfolio.

Both brands also have a presence in Asia, as well as a shared desire to grow there. For its part, Chantecaille opened four stores in China, South Korea and Singapore in 2020 and does 10% of its online business through Tmall. Meanwhile, Beiersdorf has partnerships with Alibaba, JD.com and the Chinese cross-border commerce platform NetEase Kaola.

It makes sense that Beiersdorf’s Asia ambitions would be served well by a new prestige brand. Prestige beauty recovered faster than other categories in 2021, dropping 17% in 2020 but growing by 11% in the first half of 2021, according to The NPD Group. In its third-quarter earnings report in November, Beiersdorf reported that sales in Asia grew by 11%, led by La Prairie, the sole prestige brand in its portfolio at the time.

Warnery also highlighted Chantecaille’s focus on sustainability and social good, calling the brand a “clarion voice for global environmental concerns.” Demand for sustainable skin care is high, with the market expected to be worth more than $22 billion by 2024, according to Statista. None of Bieresdorf’s other brands have a specific focus on sustainability, although Beiersdorf does have overarching sustainability goals, including reaching 100% renewable energy by 2025. Chantecaille uses post-consumer recycled paper in its products, has reduced all printed materials and has done away with disposable gift bags. Its products are vegan and cruelty-free, as well.

While Beiersdorf’s acquisition of Chantecaille is a step toward reaching that market, it doesn’t come without risks.

“This is definitely a sustainability play as, for big conglomerates, it’s easier to buy a company to get in the sustainability game versus trying to build that capability internally organically,” said Jonathan Treiber, CEO of RevTrax. “An acquisition will lead to a major culture shock for any business that is now a part of a much larger corporation. I usually expect talent from the smaller company to leave over the first 18 months, so retaining people, culture and innovation should be of the highest priority for Beiersdorf.”",Beiersdorf’s Chantecaille acquisition fills a prestige-shaped hole in its portfolio

Findings were initially due to be published at the end of last year,​ but delays meant the findings had only now been released. The Cosmetics Packaging Guidance​​ was being made available to the public “for the good of the environment” ​and “in the spirit of the open innovation approach”,​ the three companies said. Findings would also be shared with industry consortium CosPaTox (Cosmetic Packaging Toxicology).

A ‘solid foundation’ for proper handling of recyclates in cosmetic packaging​

Immo Sander, head of packaging development at Wener & Mertz said: “We have created a solid foundation for the proper handling of recyclates in the future and have shown that conformity to standards for cosmetics packaging made of post-consumer recyclates can be achieved and will be ensured.”​

Michael Becker, head of global packaging development at Beiersdorf, said the guidance would help manufacturers and brands like Beiersdorf, and all supply chain stakeholders, advance sustainable packaging agendas over the coming years.

“Our ambition is to substantially increase the proportion of recyclates in our plastic packaging (…) With the jointly developed guidelines, we want to actively contribute to giving the recycling industry orientation and assistance with the urgently required additional capacity of high-quality plastic recyclates for the cosmetic industry,”​ Becker said.

Beiersdorf said the initial aim of the joint research had been to create an industry standard that overturned uncertainties in the market caused by a lack of defined conditions in which recycled material could be used for cosmetics packaging under the EU Cosmetics Regulation (EC) No. 1223/2009​​.

By building an inventory of existing recyclates on the European market – existing recycling processes, available qualities and material properties – and comparing this with cosmetic packaging requirements under the EU Regulation, the document would be “a first industry-standard for cosmetic grade recycled plastic”​.

Beiersdorf said the research project and resulting guidance ultimately played into building circular business models for the beauty sector.

In April last year, the UK Cosmetic, Toiletry and Perfumery Association (CTPA) also shared guidance on use of recycled materials in plastic packaging​ which also aimed to debunk regulatory and technical hurdles.

NIVEA was able to significantly expand its market share in the face care category, especially in Europe, on the back of the NIVEA LUMINOUS630 range’s success.The selective cosmetics segment posted the largest growth rates. Demand for La Prairie increased by 20.1%. This was driven by a recovery in travel retail business, which was hit hardest by the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020. In particular in China, La Prairie sales rose above average and were far above the pre-crisis level of 2019 by the end of the fiscal year.The Derma business unit continued to perform successfully. After posting high sales growth in 2020, revenue from the Eucerin and Aquaphor brands rose strongly again (+19.5%) in fiscal year 2021. Main growth drivers were the strategically important markets of the United States, Germany, Latin America and China.The Healthcare business unit, which mainly comprises plaster business with the Hansaplast and Elastoplast brands, increased organic sales by 13.7%. Market launches in the wound care category and a strong recovery in the sports category had a particularly positive impact on sales.The tesa Business Segment continued on its growth trajectory in 2021, a trend that began to emerge in the second half of 2020. Organic sales rose by 13.6% to €1.5 billion ($1.7 billion). This high demand was underpinned mainly by industrial business, in particular by the electronics and automotive business.Further important milestones were achieved in implementing the C.A.R.E.+ strategy in 2021. They included, for example, expansion of the successful care range NIVEA LUMINOUS630 in Europe, successful integration of the Coppertone brand, acquisition of the prestige beauty brand Chantecaille , the increasing use of digital technologies to cultivate markets, and further increase of the capacity to innovate thanks to the establishment of a global research and development network.In addition, Beiersdorf systematically pressed ahead with implementing its sustainability agenda Care Beyond Skin in the past fiscal year, which also applies to the product level. That relates to developing new products and optimizing existing product ranges. For instance, the first climate-neutralized NIVEA products were launched in 2021. Others are to follow this year.Beiersdorf also made considerable progress toward its climate targets, reducing its absolute Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions by 12.7% versus the base year 2018. Beiersdorf committed to ambitious climate targets in 2020. Absolute Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions are to be cut by 30% compared to 2018 levels by 2025.Regardless of the skin care market’s growth, Beiersdorf assumes it will still outperform the market. The group expects the improvement in the global skin care market to continue in 2022.Given that assumption, the group anticipates that Consumer business will post sales growth in the mid single-digit range.Given the uncertainty regarding the market development in 2022, Beiersdorf also expects tesa business to generate above-market sales growth at mid single-digit range.The group anticipates sales growth in the mid single-digit range in 2022.",Beiersdorf Exceeds Pre-Pandemic Group Sales in Fiscal Year 2021

The company said the formulas could be used to develop sunscreen lotions and creams, predominantly for the skin, but also variants that offered protection for the scalp and hair.

Importance placed on aesthetics and product feel​

“In some embodiments, the compositions, when applied on skin, have attractive shimmer and glow effects that provide a product mass tone that disappears on the skin. For example, in one variation, the composition imparts a golden, rosy, coppery, bronzed or rose gold, shimmering effect on the skin,” ​Beiersdorf wrote in its patent filing.

Importantly, the company said the products could be applied to “all skin types”​ without altering skin tone or creating an ash or chalk effect.

Beyond aesthetics, it said the formulas could also be designed to provide a “cooling”​ and “light feel”​ that resembled a moisturiser rather than a sunscreen. This, it said, was achieved via a “quick break effect” ​whereby upon application there was an instant water release providing a cooling effect on the skin.

Designed around restrictions for US market​

Beiersdorf said it had developed several formulation variations using different pigments, and in some cases layered substrates, to avoid ingredients that were either prohibited in US cosmetics market or restricted. Silver powder, for example, had been avoided altogether and so had titanium dioxide because it could not be used in combination with avobenzone.

Suitable layered-substrate pigments, it said, included glass, silica and mica. Suitable colorants included metal oxides, metal salts and organic pigments. In any combination, Beiersdorf said the pigment part of the composition had to be between 1%-25% by weight of the total product.

Other active agents were also integrated into the formulas to offer SFP protection, alongside additional benefits like anti-ageing, anti-wrinkle, oily skin treatment and even insect repellent properties.

“It is typical to use combinations of two or more skin care active agents in a formulation,”​ Beiersdorf said, though any combination had to align with FDA guidelines and restrictions from other governing US bodies.

The company said all formulations had been developed to adhere to a Sun Protection Factor (SPF) of 15, 30 or 50, with some also offering UVA Protection Factor. The formulas could also be developed to have strong water resistance and be tear-free.

According to a Sept. 7, 2022, report by Top Class Actions, Bayer Healthcare, former owner of Coppertone sunscreen, and Beiersdorf, the current owner, will pay out $2.3 million to settle a class action suit against the brand for misleading the public in terms of the product's safety, when in fact it contained benzene.

See archived: Bayer, Beiersdorf to Settle Over 'Misleading Mineral-based' Coppertone Claim

The suit alleges the Coppertone brand misled consumers, ""by labeling, touting and marketing its products as being healthy, safe, pure and simple while knowing ... (and not disclosing) ... that the products contain benzene (or ... the risk of containing benzene),"" the source stated.

2021 Coppertone Recall

As previously described, Coppertone issued a voluntary recall in 2021 of specific lots of five sunscreen products due to the presence of benzene. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) sent out a public notification of the products being recalled, which included:

Pure & Simple SPF 50 Spray (2021 launch),

Pure & Simple Baby SPF 50 Spray,

Pure & Simple Kids SPF 50 Spray,

Sport Mineral SPF 50 Spray (2021 launch), and

Travel-Size Coppertone Sport Spray SPF 50 (1.6 oz) aerosol sunscreen sprays.

The products were manufactured between the dates of Jan. 10, 2021, and June 15, 2021.

As the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) explained, benzene is classified as a human carcinogen and, ""exposure to it can occur through inhalation, oral and skin and it could, depending on the level and extent of exposure, result in an increased risk of cancers including leukemia, and blood cancer of the bone marrow and other blood disorders which can be life-threatening.""

In the public notification, however, the agency added, ""Daily exposure to benzene at the levels detected in these affected Coppertone aerosol sunscreen spray products would not be expected to cause adverse health consequences based on generally accepted exposure modeling by numerous regulatory agencies...""

2022 False Ad Suit and Settlement

The class action settlement was extended to Coppertone spray products manufactured before Aug. 2, 2022, Top Class Actions reported, and to include the following additional products:

Sport SPF 30,

Sport SPF 15,

Complete SPF 50,

Complete SPF 30,

FRANKFURT, April 28 (Reuters) - Beiersdorf (BEIG.DE), the maker of Nivea skin care products and Tesa glue, cut the forecast for full-year sales at its adhesives unit on Thursday due to extensive lockdowns in China and ongoing supply chain issues in the automotive industry.

The Tesa adhesives unit, which serves the electronics and automotive markets and accounts for about a fifth of Beiersdorf sales, had been the group's fastest-growing business in 2021 thanks to growth in the Chinese electronics business.

However, the recent COVID-19 surge in China hurt the unit's growth in the first quarter, and Beiersdorf said it now expects Tesa to grow sales in the low to mid single-digit range in 2022, compared to its previous target for mid single-digit growth.

""I think the second quarter will be a challenging quarter,"" Chief Financial Officer Astrid Hermann told a news conference.

""The electronics business in Asia, so much of it is centered around Shanghai. Reading the news, you will see a lot of the electronics business there is impacted. We have to see how we weather that and how we can rebound in the second half,"" she said.

Beiersdorf also confirmed its preliminary first-quarter results published on April 8 and targets for its consumer goods unit announced on March 1.

Effective Feb. 1, Chantecaille’s global operations will be part of the Beiersdorf Group. As part of the consumer business, the company will continue to be managed separately as a complementary selective brand within the Beiersdorf Group. The closing comes five weeks after the announcement of the planned transaction on Dec. 21, 2021.

Since its inception, an integral part of the purpose-led company is its deep commitment to philanthropy and sustainability. The company’s efforts in global environmental concerns fully support Beiersdorf’s sustainability agenda Care Beyond Skin.



“Today’s closing of the Chantecaille transaction marks another important milestone in the implementation of our C.A.R.E.+ strategy,” said Patrick Rasquinet, member of the executive board for pharmacy and selective brands. Chantecaille complements our portfolio in prestige beauty with innovative skin care, cosmetics and fragrance products that are based on botanical ingredients. In addition, the new brand will further accelerate our growth in the North American and Asian markets. I’m convinced that together with its dedicated team we will develop Chantecaille to the next level and continue to grow the brand as a leader in natural beauty.”

Beiersdorf, the Hamburg-based cosmetics manufacturer, plans to use packaging made from recycled aluminum in future, a press release said Thursday (May 27, 2021). Beiersdorf is collaborating with the Swiss packaging company, Nussbaum, to launch the first aerosol cans e.g., spray deodorants, made from the sustainable material in late 2021. The companies have spent one year developing the production from old drink cans, Beiersdorf said.

Aerosol cans from old drink cans

""The outstanding feature of the technology is that no primary aluminum is used here at all, but rather sorted aluminum waste from beverage cans. We are thus using a raw material entirely in line with the circular economy,"" said Markus Tomasini, CTO of Nussbaum Matzingen AG. The reused aluminum requires up to 95 per cent less energy in the recycling process without any loss of quality. Plans are also being laid to procure all of the aluminum drink cans regionally to guarantee short material routes.

Beiersdorf aims to achieve own climate targets

""We are initiating a cross-industry rethink through our pioneering co-operation with Nussbaum along the supply chain and reducing our carbon footprint by up to 90 per cent in terms of aerosol cans,"" said Norbert Menzel, Principal for Packaging Technology at Beiersdorf. Apart from producing aerosol cans, Beiersdorf will gradually make its product range more sustainable and use recycled aluminum in packaging. The goal is a 30 per cent reduction in emissions along the value chain by 2025 over 2018, Menzel added. ""Our approach covers the entire value chain including suppliers, partners and logistics,"" said Jean-François Pascal, Beiersdorf Vice President of Corporate Sustainability. Last December, Beiersdorf began collaborating with the Sabic chemical company to develop plant-based cosmetics packaging.

Find out how career development support and networking opportunities at HHL helped this international student land a role with Beiersdorf in Germany

Germany's diverse culture, large economy, and leading technology sector—not forgetting Oktoberfest—led Giang Ly to travel 6000 miles from her home in Vietnam to enroll in an MBA.

In her previous career, Giang had developed international connections, working in digital media across Southeast Asia, from a global media agency, Mindshare, part of GroupM, to WPP, the world’s leading advertising company, to a Dutch online marketing agency Pervorm, now part of Deloitte Digital Amsterdam

While working for Mindshare in Vietnam, she decided to pursue an MBA in Germany at HHL Leipzig Graduate School of Management.

The program gave Giang a platform for success, allowing her to continue her career in Germany after graduation. After an intensive year spent networking and curating her application, she landed a role as global experience manager at leading skincare manufacturer Beiersdorf, in Hamburg.

Vietnam to Germany: Before Beiersdorf

Before her MBA, Giang worked in marketing, developing digital campaigns for clients like FrieslandCampina and Suntory PepsiCo. After joining the Management Trainee Program at Mead Johnson Nutrition, a US company, she joined Pervorm, now part of Deloitte Digital Amsterdam, as a consultant for Southeast Asia.

After two years with Pervorm, her old employer approached her with a new leadership opportunity. She'd be tasked with building a team, leading client business, and working directly with clients on a macro level. Giang was eager to take on the opportunity, but felt she needed to upskill.

""I felt like I needed more business and people management skills. That's why the idea of pursuing an MBA outside of Asian markets came to me,"" she explains.

Giang decided on Germany to step outside of her comfort zone. She was attracted to the German working culture, which would provide a contrast with business in Asia. HHL was the clear option for an MBA, she says.

""HHL appealed to me as one of the leading business schools in Germany, focusing on strategy and digital transformation with an entrepreneurial mindset.""





Studying at HHL: Preparing for Beiersdorf

Giang's b-school journey began in Leipzig amid COVID-19. This meant she met peers virtually for the first six months and had classes online. While this was a challenging start, she says HHL's support helped her navigate student life.

The HHL full-time MBA has a diverse range of courses that incorporate established business management concepts and skills for the digital age. Key modules include: Strategy, Innovation, and Transformation.

Giang enjoyed the mix of practical and theoretical learning: ""We worked on many case studies, based on the theory we learned in class, and our independent research.”

Keen to focus on her career, Giang says she started working on her career development before she even started the program.

""Before I joined the MBA, I connected with the alumni network to understand how they navigated the MBA and how they managed to get a job in Germany or Europe. Everyone told me to start as soon as possible.""

Following their advice, after two months Giang contacted Kati Dorsch at HHL's career development team to help set a clear plan to enter the German job market.

The HHL career development support, which offers classes and tests to help students identify their strengths, is ranked eighth in Europe by the Financial Times and helps 87% of graduates land jobs in Germany. Students typically see an average salary increase of 80%.

""Career counseling at HHL always starts with self-assessment to provide a personal compass using psychometric and intuitive methods,"" Kati says. ""Once the student's career goal is defined, we advise them on job exploration and search methods.""

HHL sets up various events to help students connect with compatible employers. Giang highlights a company speed dating night, along with targeted events based on industry sectors such as digital, finance, and startups.

""We build bridges to companies by opening doors to a wide range of potential employers through on-campus recruiting events, alumni talks, and other networking sessions,"" Kati explains.

Giang says HHL's alumni network was also an invaluable tool: there are 3200 alumni currently living and working across 70 countries.

""HHL alumni are a strong network, and everyone is so welcoming. They shared information, supported and reviewed my CV writing; they even did mock interviews with me,"" she says.

Launching a career at Beiersdorf

When considering her future career options, Giang curated a list of companies she was interested in working for. Beiersdorf was a key target, and Kati connected her with an HHL alumnus who worked there.

""He shared with me insights about the company, the division, the role and helped me with the application and interview process,"" Giang says.

Giang received her offer for the role of global experience manager for Nivea Men at Beiersdorf in December 2021, six months before graduating from HHL.

""It was a big step. Going from the mindset of a local market to a global one is a huge transition,"" she explains.

Now six months into her role at Beiersdorf, Giang works on digital projects, identifying new playing fields and digital touchpoints for Nivea Men to differentiate the brand and identify holes in the market.

She also works on a variety of digital technologies to facilitate better engagement with customers.

The role sees Giang regularly drawing on her HHL education, using the data analytical skills she learned to build data sets and find ideas for new creations for the brand.

""I can see the different insights from different countries and regions,"" she says. ""That's where the knowledge I gained from the MBA program helps me navigate my new role as the global manager.""

Founded 25 years ago, the prestige beauty brand is valued between $590m and $690m

Premium cosmetics business Chantecaille has been acquired by German-based multinational Beiersdorf.

Valued between US$590m and $690m, Chantecaille has been trading since 1997 and offers skin care, fragrance and colour cosmetics in its repertoire.

The Nivea owner is expected to run the beauty brand as a separate entity to other members of its portfolio, similar to its set up with luxury skin care name La Prairie.

Despite its French roots, the company trades out of its New York head office and has a global presence, with particular interest in the US.

For 2021 the brand is expected to report global sales in excess of $100m.

The family-established brand, still run by matriarch Sylvie Chantecaille, was founded on the purpose of philanthropy, shining a spotlight on environmental and conservationist issues.

Chantecaille’s daughters, Olivia and Alex, and son Philippe today hold executive roles within the company, as does husband Olivier.

“Through the acquisition of Chantecaille, we are bolstering our portfolio in prestige beauty and strengthening our position, especially in the United States, China and Korea, which is a priority of our C.A.R.E.+ strategy,” said Vincent Warnery, CEO of Beiersdorf.

“We are pleased to welcome Chantecaille and its dedicated team to the Beiersdorf family. With its strong philanthropic approach, Chantecaille is a clarion voice for global environmental concerns and supports conservation efforts around the world that are in line with Beiersdorfs’ sustainability agenda, Care Beyond Skin.”

In August last year, Beiersdorf announced that its manufacturing plant in Berlin, Germany, would become its first facility to switch to biogas in 2022, using biomethane and green electricity, reducing its overall CO2 output by 99% compared with 2018.

In 2020, Beiersdorf, along with L’Oréal, became one of the top most responsible companies for protecting forests, as named by not-for-profit CDP.

It has also taken steps to reduce plastic pollution by opting for a bio-based polypropylene resin for its Nivea packaging.

Chantecaille, meanwhile, has dedicated numerous beauty products to funding conservation work around the world, raising awareness of endangered animals.

Each season the brand aligns itself with a charitable cause for organisations that are protecting the environment.

Most recently, Chantecaille built a life-size herd of Asian elephants as part of a public art project to raise awareness of the overlap between humans and the animal kingdom.

Inspired by the Nilgiri Hills of Southern India, the wooden statues went on display in the UK capital in St James Park and Berkeley Square.

Speaking about the brand’s new owner, Sylvie Chantecaille added: “We looked very carefully for a great steward that could help take Chantecaille to the next level and continue to further Chantecaille’s acceleration as a leader in natural beauty.

“The fact that Beiersdorf shares the same core values made them an ideal choice.”

The brand launches in key European markets with a simple routine: facial cleansing plus day care as well as evening facial cleansing plus night care. O.W.N uses artificial intelligence and is built around a proprietary algorithm that combines 140 years of skin care expertise and consumer knowledge. As a result, O.W.N. selects the single best unique product offering out of 380,000 formula combinations. The products are sold as part of a purely digital business model via the website www.ownskincare.eu , where consumers fill out a questionnaire to determine which care formula is best suited to their skin.“The launch of O.W.N strengthens our focus on personalized skin care innovations – based on individual needs and scientific findings,” explains Beiersdorf AG CEO Stefan De Loecker. “The whole project is an internal startup: a few dedicated entrepreneurial people and a ton of passion and hard work managed to drum up support from all functions to make this happen.”The product range of O.W.N is based on the particular combination of the consumer’s skin condition and the consumer’s specific wish to improve their skin.“Our point of difference is that the products evolve automatically with every new order – including criteria such as lifestyle, people’s personal circumstances, or seasonal changes,” adds De Loecker. “With this holistic approach, we not only maintain a direct digital connection with consumers, but we also enhance our knowledge regarding consumers and their skin. This will help us to offer even better personalized solutions in the future.”Behind the development of the personalized face care products lies a specifically designed algorithm based on insights and data from a survey of more than 4,000 consumers conducted in the run-up to the brand launch. Another actor contributing to Beiersdorf’s in-depth expertise in this market segment is the large-scale “Skinly” study. More than 10,000 women have already taken part in this study in Europe and Asia and have taken a total of over 2.5 million skin measurements to date. The data obtained in this way is continuously helping scientists to better understand external influences on the skin, such as those caused by UV radiation or air pollution, and to counteract negative effects more effectively. For Dr. Frank Schwanke, manager of the Personalization Accelerator launched in 2019, cross-functional knowledge transfer at Beiersdorf also plays a key role in the continuous development of personalized skin care.“Our Personalization Accelerator is anchored in the R&D department and integrates a dynamic team from supply chain, IT, marketing and R&D,"" said Schwanke. ""We bundle, structure, and strengthen synergies from various initiatives within the company. This is another strong point proving that our unique consumer knowledge is an enhancer to unlock white spot potential and to win with skin care.”Each O.W.N. product is specially made for the brand’s individual consumers. The jars and bottles are filled with ingredients that are formulated for individual skin care needs. With the O.W.N product range, consumers are provided with everything they need for their personal facial skin care. This is also reflected in the brand name: O.W.N stands for ""Only What's Needed"". In the course of the online shopping process, not only the formulas but also the packaging is personalized so that the consumers’ first names form a unit with the brand name – for example “MARY’S O.W.N”. Their individual personality thus once again becomes the focus of the very shopping experience.For a growing number of consumers today, responsible consumption plays an increasingly important role in their everyday lives. O.W.N products support these consumers in reducing their personal ecological footprint – among other things, by using as many naturally derived and biodegradable ingredients as possible for the products’ vegan formulations. In addition, the brand uses refillable jars, and bottles as well as outer packaging made from organic materials to reduce plastic waste. All single used components are recyclable. Hence, the new brand also pays directly into Beiersdorf’s sustainability agenda ""Care Beyond Skin.""",Personalized Skin Care from Beiersdorf

STAMFORD — Skin-care company Beiersdorf is relocating its North American headquarters from Wilton to Stamford, officials said, placing its main U.S. offices in a more central location to support its growth.

Known for brands such as Aquaphor, Coppertone, Eucerin, La Prairie and Nivea, Beiersdorf plans to move in mid-November to offices at 301 Tresser Blvd., in the downtown Stamford Plaza complex. About 185 employees will work out of the new offices.

The company’s main U.S. offices are now based at 45 Danbury Road in Wilton, its hometown since November 2011. It has a 10-year lease there that will soon end, according to company officials.

“We are excited to call the dynamic city of Stamford home to our new North America headquarters,” Mauricio Valdes, acting general manager of Beiersdorf North America, said in a statement. “Stamford’s rich cultural diversity, accessibility and convenience to both New York City and our new North America R&D Innovation Center (in New Jersey) will serve as the ideal hub for our continued growth and expansion in the region.”

The company has signed a lease for 27,492 square feet at 301 Tresser, according to the Stamford Office of Economic Development. With a campus covering approximately 1 million square feet — also including buildings at 263 Tresser, 281 Tresser and 107 Elm St. — Stamford Plaza represents one of the largest office complexes in Connecticut.

“I am confident that our newly designed space with its inspirational views and architecture will provide the perfect backdrop for our regional and global colleagues to connect, collaborate and innovate,” Valdes said.

Beiersdorf is headquartered in Hamburg, Germany. In the U.S., it also has offices in Bentonville, Ark., and a soon-to-open global R&D Innovation Center in Florham Park, N.J. The company employs more than 20,000 worldwide.

At 301 Tresser, Beiersdorf’s offices will be located a block from the offices of another Germany-headquartered consumer-goods powerhouse, Henkel. The latter opened its North American consumer goods headquarters at 200 Elm St. in 2017.

Despite the proliferation of remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic, Stamford has continued to attract major companies, with other newcomers including manufacturer and technology-services firm ITT, real estate-focused financial-technology firm Tomo Networks and Webster Bank. ITT and Webster have decided to move their headquarters to Stamford — respectively from White Plains, N.Y., and Waterbury. When it was founded last year, Tomo announced that it would be based in Stamford.

Among companies already headquartered in the city, Charter Communications earlier this year opened its new headquarters at 406 Washington Blvd., next to the downtown Metro-North Railroad station and a few blocks from its longtime headquarters at 400 Atlantic St. WWE, which is now based at 1241 E. Main St., plans to start its move late next year to its future headquarters at 677 Washington Blvd.

In the third quarter of this year, Stamford’s central business district recorded 145,000 square feet of leasing activity, up 2 percent from the previous quarter, according to commercial real estate firm CBRE. Despite the increasing demand, the market still trails its five-year quarterly average of 195,000 square feet.

The campaign was informed by two key insights: 1) Brand loyalty continues to shift throughout the pandemic; and 2) With inflation on the rise, consumers are motivated to save money. Beiersdorf deployed integrated digital promotion tactics and offers for Eucerin®, powered by Quotient, to reach targeted shopper groups at scale, maximize reach, drive trial and increase basket size. Digital promotions allowed Beiersdorf to target shoppers with granularity, measure results and empower shoppers to save on their own terms—whether in-store or online.

Key elements of the campaign approach included:

A strategically timed launch ahead of peak dry skin season, to allow the brand to capitalize when the consumer is ready to stock up, driving basket while increasing loyalty and repeat shopping trips.

By opting for a bio-based polypropylene resin, the cosmetics maker is reducing the production of fossil-based, virgin plastic

Cosmetics maker Beiersdorf has opted for a sustainable packaging alternative for Nivea’s Naturally Good day and night creams.

The German manufacturer will now house its skin care jewel’s products in a bio-based polypropylene resin from Saudi Arabian chemicals company Sabic.

The move is part of Beiersdorf’s sustainable packaging targets to reduce fossil-based, virgin plastic for its cosmetics products by 50%.

Meanwhile, the sustainable alternative will help Beiersdorf reduce its carbon emissions and environmental footprint, outlined in its Sustainability Agenda, Care Beyond Skin.

“We are excited to implement this important change in the packaging of our Nivea brand products and to be the first in the skin care mass market to use polypropylene made from second-generation bio-based feedstock on a global basis,” said Michael Becker, Head of Global Packaging Development at Beiersdorf.

“Together with Sabic, we have taken a major step forward in transforming conventional fossil-based packaging in the cosmetics and skin care segment towards fully sustainable material alternatives.”

Nivea’s new packaging will be phased in to points of sale from June 2021.

The tech centre would be focused on formulation upgrades, including switching out preservatives, using more natural ingredients, working more with actives, and developing formulas that targeted the skin microbiome. But it would also be sharply focused on packaging re-design and innovation with sustainable and recycled materials, as well as dedicated to incorporating the latest digital technologies in all stages of production.

Beiersdorf tech centre to provide end-to-end manufacturing, collaboration and digital thinking​

Speaking to CosmeticsDesign-Europe about the tech centre, Harald Emberger, senior VP of supply chain and member of the executive committee at Beiersdorf, said the over-arching goal of the development was “severalfold.”​

“The first aspect is really [to ensure] the best possible end-to-end industrialisation of our product and ideas and outcome of the research work we have with our consumer insights. And I really say end-to-end for the capability needs; to go from process to filling to packing to shipping, especially in modern times,”​ Emberger said.

Harald Emberger, senior VP of supply chain at Beiersdorf

“The second aspect is to collaborate, work and have the facilities and space to collaborate with suppliers, customers and consumers to work on new concepts and superior concepts. And the third aspect is to take us into the digital space; to provide the capabilities and the space to work with robotics, AI and other technologies for future process development and aspects which we can’t do at the moment.”​

One-third of Beiersdorf tech centre will be ‘collaboration space’​

The centre, he said, had been designed in such a way that one-third of the total space was dedicated to collaboration – a move especially important in today’s beauty and personal care category.

“In the future, we will not be able to fulfil all the changes, requirements, fashions and trends by ourselves, so we will have to rely more and more on our suppliers, customers and consumers to get insight or ask them to help. So, we’ve purposely designed that in.”​

Whilst Beiersdorf already extensively collaborated with its suppliers and other partners, this dedicated space within the tech centre would enable collaboration to become a deeper part of business operations and build talent where and when it mattered, Emberger said.

Encouraging more outside and internal collaboration would then see Beiersdorf ultimately able to create “a new horizon on the way we make product”.​

‘Future-proofing’ Beiersdorf for rapid beauty and retail change ​

Emberger said the technology centre was about “future proofing”​ Beiersdorf in a rapidly changing beauty and personal care market where the pace of innovation was speeding up drastically and the retail environment morphing.

It would enable the company, for example, to cater to rising needs in an increasingly digital retail environment, he said. “Especially with the rapid change in the e-commerce market in markets like Asia where you have product moving literally every week, these sorts of capabilities are critically important.”​

Beiersdorf's new tech centre will enable faster speed-to-market and NPD turnaround times (Image: Beiersdorf)

Catering to the boom in beauty e-commerce, which was worldwide, he said, required more frequent product news, lower volumes, but more personalised offerings. “For us, time to market is very critical. And the more capabilities and capacities you have, the faster you can be.” ​

The new ways of working within the tech centre, Emberger said, would also see the company transition from “a very sequential way of working to a parallel way of working” ​– accelerating the concept-to-product, therefore “bringing a competitive edge”.​

Typically, in the beauty and personal care space, he said fundamental innovation happened every three or four years; Beiersdorf wanted to half that timeline via this new tech centre.

‘A leapfrog forward’ – added consumer benefits and better brand building ​

The centre would also help steer Beiersdorf away from its traditionally formulation-heavy R&D focus, he said.

“In our history, we focused more on the formulation itself and so for us this is a leapfrog forward in having end-to-end capability. Sometimes the consumer benefits are not about the product itself, but the packaging or how you apply it or the way you recycle it – there are different consumer benefits to a product.”​

Sustainability, he said, was one core focus the tech centre would enable Beiersdorf to consider from concept to product more closely – either via the formulation, packaging, processing or otherwise.

Emberger said that, overall, Beiersdorf would also be better placed to expand and edge into emerging beauty markets once the tech centre was up and running.

“Especially in emerging markets, it’s about brand building. How do you build a brand in a new market? How do you position them in the right way? There’s a lot of incremental changes to the product positioning that you can do quicker through the tech centre, so it will help us build the brand globally and defend the market share of the brand in existing markets because we can be faster with new innovations.”​

“…It’s about competitive edge to hold market share and gain market share,”​ he said.

Stefan De Loecker, CEO of Beiersdorf, described the investment in the centre as a “strong signal”​ that demonstrated the strength of the company to continue its success through innovation.","‘A leapfrog forward’: €60m Beiersdorf tech centre to sharpen competitive edge, says senior exec"

The German maker of personal care products also wants to avoid losing the market position of its brands, which is something of which Beiersdorf has ""a long painful history,"" the CEO told shareholders during the company's annual general meeting.

War Impact

The CEO added the impact of war in Ukraine on Beiersdorf's operations is ""not significant"", so there is no reason to adjust the group's forecasts.

Competitor Henkel also said earlier in April it would continue its Russian business while stopping all investments, advertising and sponsoring measures.

Organic Group Sales

Last week, the Nivea-maker announced that its organic group sales increased by 10.3% in the first quarter of its financial year, to €2.2 billion, according to provisional data.

This growth is above current capital markets expectations, the Nivea-maker noted.

Organic sales in its consumer business segment increased by 11.6% year on year, with sales amounting to €1.8 billion.

The skincare giant said its 2022 full-year sales forecast for the consumer business segment, published in March of this year, remains unchanged in light of the current volatile market environment.

Beiersdorf anticipates sales growth in the mid-single-digit range for its consumer division.

Produced entirely out of used beverage cans, the innovative aerosol packaging required a year of development.

The first Beiersdorf products in aerosol cans made from 100 percent recycled aluminium will be rolled out in the market as early as at the end of 2021.

“The great thing about this technology is that it is the first that does not use any primary aluminium, instead it is using aluminium waste from beverage cans,” says Markus Tomasini, CTO of Nussbaum Matzingen AG. The new technology thus opens a new chapter towards a more circular economy in the persona care industry.

All of the aluminium beverage cans used as raw material are sourced regionally in southern Germany, Austria and Switzerland, guaranteeing short material routes.

Recycled aluminium requires up to 95 percent less energy to be processed and the light metal does not forfeit any of its quality during the recycling process.

“With our pioneering partnership with Nussbaum, we are triggering a cross-industry rethink all along the value chain and are reducing our carbon footprint relating to aerosol cans by up to 90 percent,” says Norbert Menzel, Principal for Packaging Technology at Beiersdorf.

Also with the to reduce the environmental impact of their packaging, Beiersdorf entered into a cooperation with the chemical company Sabic to produce jars made from certified renewable polypropylene (PP).",Aerosols: Beiersdorf and Nussbaum to launch 100% recycled aluminium cans

In recent years, we have succeeded in establishing ourselves in the premium segment with La Prairie and Eucerin thanks overall to our skincare expertise,”​ said Vincent Warnery, CEO of Beiersdorf AG.

Warnery revealed during the firm’s FY2021 earnings conference on March 1 that the company is in the process of registering its patented active ingredient, W630, in China.

This ingredient is featured in Nivea Luminous630, its bestselling range of anti-hyperpigmentation products.

“We hope this will make us the first company after the introduction of China's new cosmetic regulation last year to receive approval for the use of such an effective ingredient in a domestic market. We are convinced that this will open up significant growth potential for us,” ​said Warnery.

Currently, products from Nivea and Eucerin that contain W630 are available in China through cross-border e-commerce.

“We are receiving such positive feedback from consumers that we will expand the range of products in the Nivea Luminous630 series in 2022. The cross-border e-commerce channel currently covers only 10% of the total online market potential of this range. Once we receive the registration, we can expect the dynamic growth trajectory,” ​said Warnery.

New innovations​

In addition to launching its bestselling products into the Chinese market, the company is also focused on developing new products that meet the needs of local consumers.

In 2020, Beiersdorf began a partnership with Alibaba’s Tmall Innovation Center (TMIC). Since then, it has launched exclusive products, including new Nivea Men products.

Following this, more than 10 additional products will be developed in 2022 in conjunction with TMIC, said Warnery.

“In the years ahead, we want to accelerate our pace of innovation in closer cooperation with our external partners such as Tmall and thereby make Eucerin and Nivea as successful as La Prairie in China.”​

La Prairie, Beiersdorf's high-end skin care brand, has managed to outpace the market in terms of growth despite the implications of COVID-19.

According to the firm, sales in China this year grew by 30% compared to 2020 and 70% compared to 2019.

La Prairie also performed strongly in China’s travel retail sector, with sales doubling compared to 2020 and grew by 73% compared to 2019.

This growth was largely driven by Hainan where the brand selectivity expanded its presence and it plans to continue this steady expansion in 2022.

Beiersdorf’s consumer business segment grew organically by 8.8% to €6.1bn (U$9.2bn) and recorded 5.4% growth in operating profit to €740m (U$826). The firm’s sales in Africa, Asia, and Australia increased by a total of 8.9% to €1.9bn (U$2.1bn).

According to Beiersdorf, both new facilities represent a strong commitment to the region and will help drive growth for the group and its brands, including Aquaphor, Eucerin, Nivea, La Prairie and Coppertone.

New Headquarters in Stamford, Connecticut

In total, 180 employees will work out of the new Stamford office at 301 Tresser Boulevard. The new space sits within a one-million square feet campus, that comprises 2.5 acres of green space in the center of the city of Stamford. It is one of the largest office complexes in Connecticut, and is ideally located - just off Interstate 95, a short walk from the Stamford train station and within driving distance of the three major local airports.

The LEED-certified, open-concept office has over 250 workpoints, collaboration areas, plus natural air venting, and a panoramic view of the Long Island Sound.

OTC and Sun Care Products

The Stamford office is within driving distance of Beiersdorf’s newly built Innovation Center, in Florham Park, N.J. Only 35 miles west of New York City, this area of New Jersey is considered a “science hot bed,” as it is also home to other large research and development centers, and has excellent access to talent and universities, suppliers, and testing institutes.

The new LEED-certified center in New Jersey spans about 32,000 square feet of office and laboratory space, collaboration spaces, a consumer sensory panel focus area and room for expansion. It is one of only two Beiersdorf regional Innovation Centers in the world; the other in Shanghai. The Innovation Center in N.J. is the first global center of excellence for over-the-counter and sun care products outside of Hamburg.

“Already a globally recognized leader in sun protection, Beiersdorf - by establishing a new regional hub for innovation in New Jersey - will gain further local insights to help identify unmet consumer needs and further fuel innovation,” said the group in a statement.

Apart from the two regional Innovation Centers in China and, now, in the U.S., Beiersdorf has regional development labs in Brazil, India, Japan, and Mexico.

“With the Beiersdorf Group, an important industry is locating to Leipzig and this is a major new development opportunity for us,” said the city’s mayor, Burkhard Jung, in the release. “We are thus positioning ourselves more broadly in Leipzig, and hundreds of new, skilled jobs are being created. The cosmetics industry in Germany has a turnover of around €8.8 billion – which puts Germany in second place in the EU only behind France. With the new investment, one of the most important companies in this industry is setting up shop in Leipzig and making an economic promise for the future.”

Beiersdorf revealed in April that it intends to shut down its skin products plant in Cleveland, TN this year and permanently lay off 134 workers. The company said it made the decision after it determined retrofitting the plant was too costly.",Skin Care Products Firm Beiersdorf to Open New $202M Hub

General Business

Skincare Company Beiersdorf Opens New Innovation Center in Florham Park

On Feb 3, 2022

Beiersdorf, the Hamburg, Germany-based skincare company whose portfolio includes globally renowned brands such as Aquaphor, Eucerin, NIVEA, La Prairie and Coppertone, has opened a new 32,000-square-foot Innovation Center in Florham Park as part of its global R&D strategy. The company has also moved its North American headquarters from Wilton, Conn. to Stamford, Conn.

Both new facilities will help drive growth for Beiersdorf with a strengthened position in the North American market. By establishing a new regional hub for innovation in New Jersey – the company will gain further local insights to help identify unmet consumer needs and further fuel innovation.

“The opening of our new headquarters in Stamford and our new Innovation Center marks an exciting new beginning for Beiersdorf North America,” said Mauricio Valdes, general manager Beiersdorf North America. “These new hubs—positioned in fast-growing, business and science centers close to New York City—demonstrate our deep commitment and investment in North America, and will expand our capabilities, open up exciting possibilities, and be at the heart of our continued growth in this pivotal region.”

The newly built, state-of-the-art Innovation Center in Florham Park is one of only two Beiersdorf regional Innovation Centers in the world; the other in Shanghai. The Innovation Center in Florham Park is the first global center of excellence for over-the-counter and sun care products outside of Hamburg.

The new LEED-certified center in New Jersey spans about 32,000 square feet of office and laboratory space with room for expansion, and includes collaboration spaces, a consumer sensory panel focus room, and state-of-the-art GMP laboratory suites for the development of OTC products.

“The Beiersdorf Innovation Center will be our powerhouse in North America,” said Beiersdorf CEO Vincent Warnery. “The U.S. represents the world’s largest skin and sun care markets. A strong R&D presence in North America and an enhanced position in skin and sun care is vital to expanding our business in the region and fully pays into our C.A.R.E.+ strategy.”

“Regional Innovation Centers are a vital part of our global R&D strategy. With this new center we significantly enhance our R&D capabilities, allowing us to accelerate innovation as well as to facilitate close collaboration with our local partners. It therefore enables us to fuse and fully leverage internal and external skin expertise in order to identify unmet consumer needs, and to develop innovative, therapeutic skin care products,” said Dr. Gitta Neufang, corporate senior vice president global R&D. Apart from the two regional Innovation Centers in China and, now, in the U.S., Beiersdorf has regional development labs in Brazil, India, Japan, and Mexico.

Beiersdorf’s Research & Development division sets industry-wide global standards on formulating, analyzing, and evaluating the effectiveness of skin care products, thanks to more than 900 scientists globally in the Consumer Business segment, including 45 in the new U.S. facility.

The firm's consumer business saw organic sales rise 4.1%, driven by the strong performance of its Eucerin and Aquaphor creams, as well as La Prairie, which was hit by the halt to global travel due to the coronavirus pandemic.

The Nivea brand saw a strong recovery in sun creams as well as shower gels and deodorants. Beiersdorf said it planned to launch its Eucerin Sun line in the United States in the coming year.

Sales for the first nine months of the year were up 12% to €5.8 billion, translating into a third-quarter figure of €1.9 billion, in line with analysts' average forecast.

'Making Significant Progress'

“Approaching the end of 2021, we have made significant progress in implementing our strategic priorities as part of C.A.R.E.+, which is also reflected by our strong nine months financial results,” commented Vincent Warnery, CEO of Beiersdorf.

“The digital transformation and the shift towards a climate-positive future in particular are increasingly relevant for our consumers – that’s why we have worked intensively to further level up our initiatives in these areas.”

Tesa Sees Growth

The Tesa adhesives unit, which accounts for about a fifth of sales, reported third-quarter organic sales growth of 4.6%, helped in particular by growth in the electronics business in China as well as a recovery in the auto industry.

The Hamburg-based firm, which announced plans for a new European hub during the summer, forecast organic sales growth for 2021 of 8-10% and an operating margin at the same level as the previous year due to rising material prices and increased investment, including in areas like recycled packaging.

The declines didn’t stop the company from investing in its C.A.R.E.+ initiative. As reported in Happi, the C.A.R.E.+ program comprises five strategic priorities:As for last year, Beiersdorf noted the sales decline was cushioned by the strong performance in the derma business with the Eucerin and Aquaphor brands. Here, Beiersdorf recorded year-on-year organic sales growth of 8.3%, with double-digit growth rates in North America, Latin America and Asia. According to Beiersdorf, the global skin care market declined in 2020, some months saw a double-digit drop, due to the coronavirus pandemic. So it’s no surprise to learn that Nivea’s sales fell 6% in 2020. Yet, the brand maintained its strong overall position worldwide in all categories and gained additional market share in over half of countries.The pandemic wreaked havoc with prestige skin care brand, La Prairie. Organic sales fell 23.9% due to significantly reduced travel and the resulting fall in sales in the important travel retail business. Despite sales recovering for a time in the course of the year and double-digit growth in China, the brand was unable to match its strong prior-year figures. With the recent launch of La Prairie at Tmall, Beiersdorf expects to further strengthen the brand’s presence in this key market.E-commerce sales rose 50% across the Group. Sales were helped by new digital innovations such as the Nivea Skin Guide web app. The company also invested in its global research and development network with a new innovation center in Shanghai, boosting local expertise in the strategically important Asia region. In addition to La Prairie, Nivea and Eucerin sales rose in China.In December, teamed up with Sabic to create renewable plastics for mass-market cosmetics packaging. The material, which debuts this year, is made of certified, renewable polypropylene from Sabic’s Trucircle portfolio.Earlier this year, Beiersdorf launched O.W.N., a personalized skin care brand that includes facial cleanser, and day and night creams. O.W.N uses artificial intelligence and is built around a proprietary algorithm that combines 140 years of skin care expertise and consumer knowledge. As a result, O.W.N. selects the single best unique product offering out of 380,000 formula combinations. The products are only available at www.ownskincare.eu , where consumers fill out a questionnaire to determine which care formula is best suited to their skin.For the first quarter of 2021, group sales rose 6.3% driven, primarily by demand for Tesa adhesives. The consumer business was up 2.7%, on the strength of the skin care business.In May, Vincent Warnery was appointed chief executive officer. He replaced Stefan De Loecker. Warnery, 52, has been a member of Beiersdorf’s executive board since February 2017 and was previously responsible for the pharmacy & selective division with the Eucerin, Hansaplast and La Prairie brands as well as the North American business. Warnery has spent his entire professional life in the consumer health care and cosmetic industry. He started his career in marketing at Procter & Gamble in 1991.

Digital business model

The new brand is based on a simple routine: facial cleansing plus day care as well as evening facial cleansing plus night care. Only available online via the website www.ownskincare.eu, O.W.N products are specially formulated for individualized skin care needs, using a proprietary algorithm that brings together Beiersdorf’s skin care expertise and consumer knowledge. All in all the brand would be able to offer personalised solutions out of 380,000 formula combinations.

In practice, consumers determine which care formula is best suited to their skin through a scientifically evaluated questionnaire. Furthermore, the products evolve automatically with every new order - including criteria such as lifestyle, people’s personal circumstances, or seasonal changes.

“With this holistic approach, we not only maintain a direct digital connection with consumers, but we also enhance our knowledge regarding consumers and their skin. This will help us to offer even better personalized solutions in the future,” explains Stefan De Loecker, Chief Executive Officer of Beiersdorf AG.

In-house start-up

“The launch of O.W.N strengthens our focus on personalized skin care innovations - based on individual needs and scientific findings,” adds De Loecker. “The whole project is an internal start-up: a few dedicated entrepreneurial people and a ton of passion and hard work managed to drum up support from all functions to make this happen.”

Behind the development of the personalized face care products lies a specifically designed algorithm based on insights and data from a survey of more than 4,000 consumers conducted in the run-up to the brand launch and the large-scale “Skinly” study, which involved more than 10,000 women in Europe and Asia.

Responsible consumption

O.W.N products also support consumers who want to reduce their personal ecological footprint. They are formulated with as many naturally derived and biodegradable ingredients as possible for the products’ vegan formulations. In addition, the brand uses refillable jars and bottles as well as outer packaging made from organic materials to reduce plastic waste.

Beiersdorf has reported a FY20 sales decline of 8.2 percent, with the multinational having been adversely affected by the pandemic. However, the company has stated that it expects a sales recovery in 2021.

THE DETAILS Organic sales fell 3.4 percent in Q4, with Nivea down 5.4 percent. Brands Eucerin and Aquaphor bucked the decline, rising 5.9 percent, while La Prairie also grew by 21 percent. Operating profit fell 17.3 percent to 906 million euros.

While sales were expected to recover this year, profitability was not expected to return in 2021. Shares of the company dropped 3.7 percent following the news.

Speaking of the troubles faced in 2020, CEO Stefan de Loecker said the year, “was challenging, but it was also a landmark year for Beiersdorf. Our clear priorities in the crisis were to ensure the safety of our employees, continue meeting the needs of our consumers and do our utmost to help society battle COVID-19.”

THE WHY? Looking forward, the personal care giant is expecting to post positive sales gains in 2021 and EBIT margin at the 2020 level.

De Loecker said of future plans, “We continued to invest in sustainability, digitalization and growth markets. This approach has paid off in terms of added brand appeal right across our group. We want to continue building on this by investing an additional 300 million euros over the next five years.”",Beiersdorf FY20 sales fall; expects sales recovery in 2021

Summary Companies Q2 organic sales up 28.3% bring H1 to pre-pandemic level

Sees 2021 sales up by single-digit percentage

Affirms guidance for flat 2021 EBIT margin

Shares rise 5.5% in early trade















BERLIN, Aug 5 (Reuters) - Nivea maker Beiersdorf's (BEIG.DE) sales rose above pre-pandemic levels as demand for adhesives and its dermatological brands roared back, pushing the shares up by more than 5% in early trade on Thursday.

Organic sales jumped 28.3% in the second quarter to deliver growth for the first half of 16.2%, achieving 3.87 billion euros revenue, a tad above the consensus estimate of 3.82 billion according to Refinitiv IBES data and the 2019 first-half figure of 3.84 billion euros.

Analysts at Jefferies said those figures ""handsomely"" beat their forecasts, driven by growth in the Nivea, La Prairie and Derma brands.

Beiersdorf's shares were up 5.5% at 0735 GMT, having earlier hit their highest level since early 2020.

The Hamburg-based firm said it expects its 2021 group sales to rise by a high single-digit percentage, having previously said that it saw positive sales growth for 2021.

""This is the momentum we want to use going forward,"" Beiersdorf's new Chief Executive Vincent Warnery said in a statement.

Under his predecessor Stefan de Loecker, Beiersdorf invested more in its consumer business to revive slowing sales growth and bought U.S. sun care brand Coppertone from Bayer for $550 million to strengthen its position in North America.

Beiersdorf's first-half margin on EBIT (earnings before interest and tax) widened to 15.3% from 13.7%. For the full year, however, it expects the margin to remain flat around 2020's level of 12.9% due to rising material prices and investments in digitisation and innovation.

Bernstein analyst Bruno Monteyne warned that Beiersdorf's guidance implied a slowdown in the recovery in the second half of the year along with an ""almighty reduction"" in profitability.

The new brand is being launched in key European markets with a range comprising facial cleansing and daycare, as well as evening facial cleansing and night care products.

O.W.N uses artificial intelligence built around a proprietary algorithm that combines Beiersdorf's 140 years of skincare expertise and consumer knowledge.

The algorithm is based on insights and data from a survey of more than 4,000 consumers, conducted in the run-up to the brand launch.

Stefan De Loecker, chief executive officer of Beiersdorf AG, commented, ""The whole project is an internal start-up: a few dedicated entrepreneurial people and a tonne of passion and hard work managed to drum up support from all functions to make this happen.""

Best And Unique

The system selects the best and unique product offering out of 380,000 formula combinations based on a scientifically evaluated questionnaire filled by consumers.

It also benefits from Beiersdorf's 'Skinly' study, which saw more than 10,000 women in Europe and Asia participating in over 2.5 million skin measurements to date.

The data obtained from this study has helped scientists better understand external influences on the skin, such as those caused by UV radiation or air pollution, and ways to counteract adverse effects more effectively, the company added.

According to Dr Frank Schwanke, manager of Beiersdorf's Personalisation Accelerator programme launched in 2019, cross-functional knowledge transfer at Beiersdorf also plays a vital role in the continuous development of personalised skincare.

""Our Personalisation Accelerator is anchored in the R&D department and integrates a dynamic team from supply chain, IT, marketing, and R&D. We bundle, structure, and strengthen synergies from various initiatives within the company.

""This is another strong point proving that our unique consumer knowledge is an enhancer to unlock white spot potential and to win with skincare.""

Digital Transformation

The new brand aligns with the company's aim to advance digital transformation within the C.A.R.E.+ strategy.

The products will be sold as part of a purely digital business model via the website www.ownskincare.eu, Beiersdorf added.

The product range offered by O.W.N takes into account consumers' present skin condition and their specific expectations around skin improvement.

""Our point of difference is that the products evolve automatically with every new order – including criteria such as lifestyle, people's personal circumstances, or seasonal changes,"" added De Loecker.

""With this holistic approach, we not only maintain a direct digital connection with consumers, but we also enhance our knowledge regarding consumers and their skin. This will help us to offer even better personalised solutions in the future.""",Beiersdorf Launches Personalised Skin Care Brand O.W.N

Beiersdorf AG is moving to the DAX index, replacing Deutsche Wohnen SE, German stock-exchange operator Deutsche Boerse AG said late Tuesday.

Because of the takeover by Vonovia SE, the minimum free float of 10% is no longer met at residential-property company Deutsche Wohnen, Deutsche Boerse said.

Personal-care-products maker Beiersdorf is currently part of the MDAX, where Talanx AG is joining to replace it. In turn, Basler AG will replace Talanx in the SDAX.

The changes will be effective Friday, Deutsche Boerse said.

Its first lineup is inspired by the tea that grows in the southern part of the country -- in Hadong County, South Gyeongsang Province.Chaul, the first Beiersdorf brand to be exclusively developed and launched in Asia, was created in Korea with plans to branch out into other markets as the company recognizes the country’s famous K-beauty trend and its role as a skin care powerhouse.“I think Korea has one of the most sophisticated and educated consumers in the world and the market stands for extremely high beauty standards,” said Endrik Hasemann, general manager of Beiersdorf Korea, during a recent interview with The Korea Herald at the company’s office in Yeouido, Seoul.From the design of the package to its inspiration, Hasemann said the brand tried to encapsulate peace of mind, comparing its identity to “this feeling of a warm cup of tea in your hand.”“This is also reflected in its philosophy which is ‘Own Your Moment. Own Your Beauty. It is a belief that true beauty is not only external but really needs to come from within as well, self-confidence-driven,” he added.Hasemann explained that Chaul is also the product of Korea’s rich tradition: It is made with locally sourced ingredients such as jaekseol tea leaves, which are naturally fermented with sunlight.“We source our tea from the Hadong area with a history of over 1,200 year. One interesting anecdote is that, in the past, it was only accessible to the royal family.”While the brand appears to lack marketing efforts where television and social media are concerned, he said the company is adopting a long-term strategy.“We started this brand for the first time as a company launching a new brand outside of Europe. Our ambitions are really high so it’s really important to make it right for the long term, not for short term growth,” he said.Hasemann is also a co-founder of NX Nivea Accelerator -- a program designed to incubate beauty startups -- and the same team in charge of the program is also behind Chaul.Against this backdrop, Chaul will be developed in a way that differs from how branding is normally done by Beiersdorf.First launched in 2019 with five startups, NX Nivea Accelerator comes at a time when the beauty industry is going through a dramatic change, with the rise of new sales channels such as live commerce during the pandemic and the increasingly closer relationship with influencers and celebrities. And the program is designed to nurture startups in various sectors of the beauty industry, ranging from indie brands and beauty tech to platform business models.“I think it all started with the belief that the beauty industry will more dramatically change within the next five years than probably in the past decades, which is driven by digitalization and more companies coming to the space,” said Hasemann.Having chosen Korea in consideration of the combination of emerging startups, the ecosystem and the technology with a focus on beauty, the program has over 200 startup candidates to begin. It will have to cut that number down to just five.The startup incubation team works with each company for a year, providing a customized program to help it realize its goals.The support includes investment, a strategic partnership, opportunities to collaborate on projects, and training and mentoring sessions led by experts in research and development, marketing and skin care.The program also provides office space in Seoul’s Hongdae neighborhood, which has a photo studio, a lounge and a storage area.This year is the second year running for the program and the second batch of teams is scheduled to graduate in July, with plans to launch a similar program in China.Lycl, one of the five startups chosen during the first round of the program, known for its beauty review and content platform Unpa.me, secured equity investment from Beiersdorf AG in 2019, making the German consumer goods firm its second-largest shareholder.“We helped one of the startups by going to our affiliates in Thailand to connect them to our local business partners there so they could accelerate their business in, for example,” Hasemann said.“Another company Reziena developed a smart mask, which is sheet masks run with microcurrent to accelerate the efficacy of the product, which I think was an amazing invention and they are about to market this,” he added.As the pandemic accelerates digitalization and spawns new businesses, he said NX Nivea Accelerator is proof of Beiersdorf Korea’s efforts to take the initiative and stay ahead of the curve.“We see the need for faster and trendier products, maybe even more personalization. And I think that is where our accelerator comes into play to ensure that we understand what is happening that we are also ready to act on those consumer needs as a company.”By Yim Hyun-su ( hyunsu@heraldcorp.com",[Herald Interview] Chaul: How Beiersdorf’s Korean tea-inspired skin care brand came about

Summary Companies Says no 'material changes' in approach from last year

Continues attempt to walk middle line on ESG issues

Comes ahead as AGM season kicks off















LONDON/BOSTON March 23 (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc, the world's largest asset manager, said on Thursday it would continue to push companies for details on how they treat ""material"" climate-related risks, despite criticism from some U.S. politicians for its stance on the energy transition.

The comments continue BlackRock's attempt to walk a middle line between Republicans who say it has overemphasized environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors in investing, and shareholder activists and other investors who say the $8.6 trillion asset manager should push companies harder to address climate issues.

In a statement on the priority areas it will focus on in talks with companies at the start of the season for annual company meetings, BlackRock (BLK.N) said while it had refined some language it uses, nothing substantive had changed.

Specifically, it would focus its engagements with portfolio companies on topics like on board quality and effectiveness; a company's strategy, purpose and financial resilience; executive incentives; climate-related risks and natural capital; and a company's impact on people, particularly its workers. Those talks can inform BlackRock's proxy voting decisions.

""There are no material changes in our approach to these themes, and our engagement with companies will continue the dialogue on material risks and opportunities relevant to their business models and sectors that we had in 2022,"" it said.

It said that environmental issues it would consider include ""water use, land use, waste management and climate risk.""

The statements were in line with recent comments by BlackRock Chief Executive Laurence Fink in his recent annual letter. Fink said BlackRock has been vocal in seeking company disclosures about their plans to navigate the energy transition, but that ""it’s not our place to be telling companies what to do.""

Why it matters: As the head of the world's largest asset manager, Fink’s letters are widely taken as a signal for how the financial community is thinking about certain topics, and how policy makers may need to respond.

Driving the news: His latest letter departs from those of the past several years, which focused largely on the need to incorporate climate risk, ESG concerns and broader corporate responsibility issues into how business should be conducted.

BlackRock is a top target of right-wing interest groups and Republican lawmakers, who have accused the firm — and specifically Fink — of pushing a so-called “woke” investing trend that does not serve investors' interests.

of pushing a so-called “woke” investing trend that does not serve investors' interests. Recently, several states have moved to pull money out of BlackRock funds, alleging the firm boycotts fossil fuels, which the company rebuts again in the new letter by touting its natural gas investments.

Between the lines: Fink’s latest dispatch deemphasizes ESG investing — increasingly a politically fraught topic — compared to his most recent annual letters. In fact, the term ESG does not appear anywhere in the letter.

The energy transition concerns are not raised until paragraph 18, and the word “climate” doesn’t appear until the eighth page of the lengthy letter. Even when it does, climate is only used five times.

Zoom in: Still, the letter indicates the company is not backing away from climate concerns.

""For years now, we have viewed climate risk as an investment risk. That’s still the case,"" the letter states.

Fink discusses the investment opportunities associated with the energy transition, potential financial repercussions from climate change-related extreme weather events and the need for companies BlackRock invests in to disclose their climate change-related risks.

Fink positions BlackRock as offering choices to clients. He also makes clear the firm does not direct companies it invests in to take certain actions on climate change or other issues, with a more hands off approach to proxy voting than in years past.

Yes, but: Fink's statement that asset managers including BlackRock should not set policy or ""be the environmental police"" contrasts with his 2020 letter to investors.

That letter stated: ""BlackRock does not see itself as a passive observer in the low-carbon transition. We believe we have a significant responsibility — as a provider of index funds, as a fiduciary, and as a member of society — to play a constructive role in the transition.""

The intrigue: Environmental groups cautioned against Fink's messaging on consumer choice in particular.

“Despite what BlackRock may say, the company appears to be giving ground to those who are trying to undermine the finance sector’s role in addressing the climate crisis,” said Cleo Rank, a sustainable finance analyst at InfluenceMap, a lobbying watchdog group.

What they’re saying: “[BlackRock is] the 800 pound gorilla here and they're definitely walking a tightrope,” Daniel Firger, managing director of Great Circle Capital Advisors, a climate finance consultancy, told Axios in an interview.",BlackRock CEO Larry Fink walks tightrope on climate investing

But when it comes to climate action, the giant asset manager isn’t presently all that far apart from its GOP detractors. Both BlackRock and congressional Republicans are fighting — albeit through different strategies — to defang a forthcoming regulation that would force companies to disclose their carbon emissions and the risks that climate change pose to their business models.

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has warned that climate risk constitutes an investment risk. But after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) proposed mandatory disclosure of those risks this spring, the $10 trillion asset manager is lobbying to weaken the final rule, according to a Lever review of BlackRock’s rulemaking comments, federal lobbying disclosures, and meeting memoranda from the SEC. So far this year, the investment firm reported spending nearly $2 million lobbying on finance issues that include climate risk and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) disclosure.

👇 Listen to journalist Rebecca Burns discuss this story.

The Wall Street Journal has described BlackRock as “walking a political tightrope” between activists on both sides of the sustainable investing debate. But the investment firm’s apparent attempt to undercut the type of measures it’s championed publicly for years instead suggests that it may have hit upon a more effective strategy for navigating the climate transition than the GOP’s outright denial. By aggressively growing the market for ESG funds — which typically net them higher management fees — while pushing watered down regulations and maintaining its status as one of world’s largest fossil-fuel investors, BlackRock can ensure that the climate crisis is a win-win-win.

SEC rulemaking, through which the agency interprets and adapts U.S. securities law according to the changes in the market, seldom garners broad public interest. However, the proposed climate disclosure rule has drawn a record-setting 14,000 comments, ranging widely in tone and content, from lobbying groups, institutional investors, elected officials, academics, and climate advocates.

Pushback on the rule stems from a predictable array of business groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, as well as Republicans in federal and state offices attacking the growing use of ESG criteria in investing. BlackRock, which has made ESG funds and disclosures mainstream, has become a central target of those attacks. On Thursday, Texas lawmakers grilled BlackRock executives about whether ESG policies are jeopardizing pension returns. A dark money group tied to conservative activist Leonard Leo has run TV ads accusing the firm of “harassing oil and gas companies, making them divest from fossil fuels.”

But in reality, BlackRock is largely aligned with its GOP critics on one of the biggest points of contention in the proposed SEC rule: the disclosure of so-called “Scope 3” carbon emissions that occur across a company’s value chain, including the impact of consumers burning fossil fuels that a company sells or helps finance.

Experts say that robust reporting of Scope 3 emissions is critical to giving the rule teeth; by contrast, a company’s direct emissions (Scope 1) and those associated with its purchase and use of energy (Scope 2) usually account for just a fraction of its overall footprint. While the GOP attacks the SEC’s statutory authority to require Scope 3 disclosures, BlackRock is pushing changes that critics say could render those requirements almost meaningless.

“We do not believe the purpose of Scope 3 disclosure requirements should be to push publicly traded companies into the role of enforcing emission reduction targets outside of their control,” the firm wrote in comments submitted to the agency.

BlackRock declined to answer specific questions from the Lever. But the firm has said there’s no contradiction between its past public statements and present private actions.

Environmental groups disagree. “BlackRock has publicly called for stronger regulation and government intervention over and over again,” wrote a coalition of 10 organizations including the Sierra Club and the Sunrise Movement in a statement responding to the firm’s rulemaking comments. “Disclosure is just the first step in an urgent and necessary regulatory framework to address climate risk. How can we expect BlackRock to support the more ambitious regulations and market interventions needed to actually reach a net zero economy?”

A Green Veneer On Business As Usual

Three years ago, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink proclaimed that “climate risk is investment risk” in his influential annual open letter to companies the firm invests in. Companies that fail to plan for the massive upheavals and new investment opportunities resulting from climate change will be left behind, Fink reasoned.

The CEO’s climate awakening, which reportedly occurred during a “boys’ trip” to Alaska with fellow bankers, didn’t change his fundamental convictions. “We focus on sustainability not because we’re environmentalists, but because we are capitalists,” Fink wrote in his 2022 annual letter, which also asked the companies BlackRock invests in to start issuing climate risk disclosures.

BlackRock’s ESG evangelism has drawn skeptics from many quarters, including its own former head of sustainable investing, who called the framework “a dangerous placebo that harms the public interest” by substituting green investment products and disclosures for meaningful action on the climate. Those disclosures are themselves a source of profit, and a separate BlackRock division now markets climate investment risk-modeling software to clients.

“Protecting an investment portfolio from the disastrous effects of climate change is not the same thing as preventing those disastrous effects from occurring in the first place,” former BlackRock executive Tariq Fancy wrote last year.

But Fink’s high-minded climate rhetoric has nonetheless provided fodder for right-wing grievances against so-called “woke capitalism,” a bizarre new front in the culture war. A report this month from Republican staffers on the Senate Banking Committee accused BlackRock and other asset managers of using their “shareholder voting power to advance a liberal political agenda.” Vanguard, one of the other investment firms targeted, has since walked back its climate commitments.

Meanwhile, Republican officials in at least five states have moved public pension money out of BlackRock, and the incoming House majority is now threatening antitrust investigations over what they term “climate collusion” against the fossil-fuel industry.

It’s true that the last few years have seen a marked shift in the climate posture of the corporate world. It’s increasingly rare to see a major corporation engaged in outright climate denial, and more than 800 publicly traded companies have released plans to achieve carbon neutrality by mid-century.

But in reality, many of those pledges amount to a green veneer on business as usual. Take the 2050 climate neutrality target announced by ExxonMobil this year, which covers the emissions required to produce half a million barrels of oil each day — but not the impact of customers actually burning all that oil.

According to the Net Zero Tracker, which assesses major companies’ climate pledges, most firms continue to omit the Scope 3 emissions that include consumer use of their products. Critics say this renders the pledges so narrow as to be almost meaningless. Retail giant Walmart’s stated strategy to achieve net-zero emissions by 2040, for example, ignores Scope 3 emissions despite the company acknowledging that such releases account for 95 percent of its total emissions.

In its own first report on climate-related risks in 2020, BlackRock declared that its operations were carbon neutral. But that metric included Scope 3 emissions only where the firm deemed them “appropriate,” such as employee business travel. The company did not factor in the more than $250 billion in fossil fuel investments included in BlackRock’s portfolio.

This spring, BlackRock projected that by 2030, three-quarters of its managed assets would be invested in companies with net-zero emissions targets. But not only did the firm omit a binding pledge to hit that target, it also failed to specify the criteria that would make such investments “net-zero aligned.”

“If BlackRock doesn’t disclose the concrete and timebound requests made to companies, this announcement is another smokescreen,” said Lara Cuvelier, sustainable investment manager for the French non-profit Reclaim Finance, in a statement responding to the announcement. “The world’s largest asset manager cannot get away with vaguely defined commitments.”

A Material World

The SEC’s proposed rule would establish special reporting requirements for companies that have set public climate targets, potentially making it harder for firms like BlackRock and the companies it invests in to conceal a stay-the-course climate strategy from investors and the broader public. All companies would also be required to disclose some Scope 3 emissions.

While backing the rule, climate advocates are urging the commission to require disclosure of all Scope 3 emissions, not just those that a company deems “material” — an accounting term of art referring to information that could impact decision-making by investors. Existing SEC guidance already clarifies that companies should disclose any material climate-related risks, but that standard has failed to produce any significant change in reporting, according to the Government Accountability Office.

“Management has incentive not to disclose risk,” said Yevgeny Shrago, climate policy director for Public Citizen, one of the groups that weighed in on the rulemaking. “When you ask whether something’s ‘material,’ that means it’s in management’s discretion what they choose to disclose.”

Climate advocates are also calling for more rigorous auditing requirements for Scope 3 emissions.

State and congressional Republicans are pushing in the opposite direction, using the complexity and cost of expansive emissions accounting as their central line of attack in round after round of bills, comment letters, and public statements.

“The Mandatory Materiality Requirement Act,” introduced this month by Reps. Bill Huizenga (R-Mich.) and Andy Barr (R-Ky.), would restrict the SEC’s ability to impose more rigorous disclosure requirements. Another bill introduced this summer would directly prohibit the SEC from requiring Scope 3 emissions disclosures.

This fall, a group of corporate Democrats including Kyrsten Sinema (Ariz.) and Jon Tester (Mont.) also urged the SEC to slow the pace of rulemaking in a letter reported by Politico.

The final SEC rule is also almost certain to face legal challenges from Republicans and business lobbies.

BlackRock’s Climate Gambit

A subtler form of opposition to the SEC rule is coming from another quarter: investment firms, most prominently BlackRock. These companies say they support a new disclosure rule but are quietly fighting its key provisions.

In June comments submitted to the agency, BlackRock began by applauding the “goal of implementing a framework for public issuers to provide investors with more comparable and consistent climate-related disclosures.”

But the firm’s comments then recommend substantial changes, including expanding a proposed “safe harbor” that would shield companies from liability for inaccurate or incomplete emissions disclosures. BlackRock also advocated for a “comply or explain” approach “which allows issuers to either disclose material Scope 3 emissions or explain why certain emissions categories are not relevant to the issuer or not subject to reasonable estimation.”

While acknowledging the importance of assessing Scope 3 emissions, BlackRock’s comments assert that the methodologies for measuring them are currently limited and still evolving, and that “with the broader adoption of reporting standards, datasets, and methodologies, they will improve meaningfully further.”

Public Citizen’s Shrago argues that requiring large companies to begin producing reasonable estimates of their emissions is precisely what will accelerate that improvement. “[Measuring Scope 3 emissions] will only get easier and cheaper with a rule requiring all companies to do it,” he said. “The challenge right now is that there just isn’t standardized data.”

BlackRock also suggests that the final SEC rule should be aligned with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Disclosures (TCFD) — an industry-led group of which BlackRock is a member. The TCFD framework, which BlackRock uses in its own climate risk reporting, recommends disclosing Scope 3 emissions “where appropriate.”

Groups like the TCFD are part of a “climate finance echo chamber” that BlackRock has helped create and fund, according to a 2021 report from Reclaim Finance. The report raised the alarm about BlackRock’s outsized role in writing the European Union’s new sustainable finance strategy and urged regulators to write their own rules rather than relying on those the industry has written for itself.

At the same time, BlackRock is pushing to narrow a separate SEC rule combating greenwashing in ESG funds, which account for more than $500 billion of assets managed by the firm.

In addition to submitting comments and meeting with SEC Chair Gary Gensler this summer, BlackRock officials met twice with Republican SEC commissioners in November. One of those commissioners, Donald Trump appointee Hester Peirce, issued a statement opposing the disclosure rule this spring.

NAIROBI, March 14 (Reuters) - Climate Finance Partnership, a fund managed by BlackRock Alternatives, is buying nearly a third of the shares in Kenyan wind farm Lake Turkana, it said on Tuesday.

Climate-focused funds are increasingly training their sights on Africa, which offers growing demand for clean energy and other climate infrastructure.

The continent is also suffering from the ravages of climate change-driven events like drought. Kenya and neighbours Ethiopia and Somalia are going through the worst drought in decades, which has caused starvation among millions.

BlackRock said the fund will acquire the stake in Lake Turkana Wind Power in Kenya's far north from Finnish development financier Finnfund, Danish wind turbines maker Vestas (VWS.CO), and the Investment Fund for Developing Countries, a Danish development financier.

A regulatory filing published in the Kenyan press on Tuesday said the stake amounts to 31.25% of the shares of LTWP, a 365-wind turbine facility with a 310 megawatt capacity.

The regulatory notice defined the stake as ""controlling"", but BlackRock later said that was within the meaning of Kenya's energy law, not in the conventional sense of a controlling or majority stake. It did not disclose the value of the deal.

""The LTWP project provides reliable, low-cost energy to Kenya's national grid via a 20-year power purchase agreement with Kenya Power,"" BlackRock said, referring to the East African nation's power distribution company.

LTWP provides just over a tenth of Kenya's power generation, offering electricity to more than 3 million people, BlackRock said.

The deal, which requires regulatory approval, represents a first private investment in Africa for BlackRock Alternatives, part of BlackRock Inc (BLK.N), it said.

The Climate Finance Partnership (CFP) is a public-private fund that targets emerging market climate infrastructure, bringing together BlackRock, the French, German and Japanese governments, and some U.S.-based organisations.

It has commitments of $637 million from a range of global investors, which exceeded its fundraising target of $500 million.

""The fund plans to invest at least 25% of its assets under management in Africa,"" it said.

Summary Companies To leave BlackRock in April after two years

Will join $10 billion Bezos Earth Fund

Bodnar was previously global head of sustainable investing















LONDON, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Paul Bodnar, the head of sustainability policy and engagement at BlackRock (BLK.N), the world's biggest asset manager, is to join tech mogul Jeff Bezos' $10 billion Bezos Earth Fund, a memo to staff on Friday reviewed by Reuters shows.

The April move will mark the end of a two-year stint at the company for Bodnar, who was previously global head of BlackRock Sustainable Investing. He took up his most recent role during a reorganisation of BlackRock's sustainability efforts in October.

It follows a tough time for the company as it faces pressure from campaigners to push for faster climate action by companies, and concern from some U.S. politicians that doing so could impact investor returns.

The memo said BlackRock assets invested through its dedicated sustainable investing platform now stood at around $500 billion of its total of roughly $8.6 trillion in assets, and Bodnar had been ""central to that success"".

""Paul approached us recently with a plan to return to his career path in the impact world, and today it will be announced that he will be joining the Bezos Earth Fund to oversee programs that involve collaboration among financial services, the real economy and governments,"" the memo said.

Feb 16 (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) President Robert Kapito's remarks during a financial conference on Thursday were interrupted several times by questions on the company's climate change responsibilities.

Kapito was talking about bonds at the Bank of America Securities Financial Services Conference in New York when someone at the event shouted questions about BlackRock’s responsibility to exit investments in fossil fuels.

The panel moderator, Craig Siegenthaler, managing director at BofA Global Research, asked to call security and Kapito said he would respond ""at the appropriate time, not interrupting the event"".

The live webcast from BlackRock's website switched to playing music. This happened twice more over the next few minutes. It was not immediately clear who was interrupting the event.

Climate activists have targeted BlackRock for years, asking the world’s largest asset manager to stop investing in fossil fuel companies, or to push them harder to cut emissions.

BlackRock has rejected the idea of divesting from fossil fuels, saying instead it wants to engage with companies on the transition to a low-carbon economy.

BlackRock has projected that by 2030 at least three quarters of its investments in companies and governments will be with issuers that have scientific targets to cut net greenhouse gas emissions.

It says its role as a fiduciary to clients ""is to help them navigate investment risks and opportunities, not to engineer a specific decarbonization outcome in the real economy,"" according to a statement on its website.

The stance has drawn criticism from many sides in the debate, with environmentalists protesting it does too little to press for change at oil, gas and coal companies in its portfolio even as Republican U.S. politicians from energy-producing states accuse it of boycotting that industry.

The top financial officer of Florida said Thursday he would bar BlackRock, a major Wall Street investment firm, from managing about $2 billion of state treasury funds because of what he called a “campaign to change the world” with company policies mindful of the environment and other concerns. Want to know how your actions can help make a difference for our planet? Sign up for the Climate Coach newsletter, in your inbox every Tuesday and Thursday. ArrowRight In targeting BlackRock, the state chief financial officer, Jimmy Patronis, said it is “undemocratic of major asset managers to use their power to influence societal outcomes.”

Headed by chief executive Larry Fink, BlackRock and other investment firms have increasingly used their client shares as clout to pressure companies into following ESG standards, short for “environmental, social and governance” policies.

It has questioned investments in sectors such as fossil fuels, a divestiture that many experts say not only benefits the climate but also is a smart investment strategy.

But nationwide, many Republican state treasurers and attorneys general have organized themselves to rebuff such ESG policies. Patronis, a Republican, is the latest.

“If Larry, or his friends on Wall Street, want to change the world, run for office. Start a nonprofit. Donate to the causes you care about,” Patronis said in a statement, citing comments from Fink about using shareholder stakes to influence corporate behavior. “Using our cash, however, to fund” a social-engineering project from BlackRock is not “something Florida ever signed up for,” he added.

Patronis also sits on the nearly $218 billion Florida State Board of Administration along with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) and Attorney General Ashley Moody (R), but for now there was no change in policy at the giant pension fund. He said at the state treasury BlackRock had managed $1.4 billion of long-duration funds and $600 million devoted to short-term cash activities.

The move against BlackRock follows efforts in states such as Missouri, Louisiana and Texas to derail ESG corporate standards and cudgel Democrats over their use.

At an August meeting of the Florida Cabinet, trustees unanimously adopted a resolution restricting the use of ESG factors in making investment decisions in the Florida Retirement System Defined Benefit Plan. The new House of Representatives, led by Republicans, plans to call executives from major financial institutions to appear at what promise to be contentious oversight committee hearings.

The politicization of the issue frustrates many fund managers, because climate change has been shown to expose companies to various risks, ranging from direct effects of extreme weather to market fluctuations. Investors themselves are also making demands.

“Most investors are saying that, in addition to getting financial returns, they want their money used in ways they are not embarrassed by,” said Joshua Gotbaum, an investment banker who has served in five administrations from both parties, including a stint as head of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.

“Unfortunately, part of what is going on is that politicians who do not want to admit that there is climate change would like to say that taking environmental and social factors into account is somehow inappropriate,” he added.

The ouster of BlackRock will have little immediate impact. The firm worldwide was managing nearly $8 trillion at the end of September.

BlackRock corporate communications director Christopher Van Es said the asset management firm acted “with the sole goal of driving returns for our clients.” He cited the “strong returns BlackRock has delivered to Florida taxpayers over the past five years.”

“We are disturbed by the emerging trend of political initiatives like this that sacrifice access to high-quality investments and thereby jeopardize returns, which will ultimately hurt Florida’s citizens,” Van Es said.

He also said that long-term investment flows into BlackRock had reached $84 billion in the third quarter of this year and $275 billion over the last 12 months. Other major asset managers include Vanguard and State Street.

It’s hard because it’s not business any more, they’re doing it in a personal way. And for the first time in my professional career, attacks are now personal. They’re trying to demonize the issues.’”

That’s fund giant BlackRock Inc.’s BLK, +0.89% Chief Executive Larry Fink’s answer when asked this week at the glitzy Switzerland gathering of executives, economists and politicians about the “anti-woke” pushback against Wall Streeters who see investment opportunity in fighting climate change.

Fink said the contrarian narrative around environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing has become ugly and is creating “huge polarization.” ESG can span issues like gender diversity on boards or executive compensation, but tends to be readily swapped for climate-focused and alternative-energy investing themes, especially as more companies are pressured to report fossil-fuel emissions or consider increasingly popular fuels like solar ICLN, +1.51% or hydrogen instead of oil CL00, -1.88% and gas.

Attention on the topic has also gained detractors who suggest any ESG focus dilutes a “neutral” fiduciary obligation that favors returns over other considerations by fund managers and other stakeholders.

“Let’s be clear, the narrative is ugly, the narrative is creating this huge polarization. If you really read the CEO letters that I’ve written in the past I talk about a transition” to new forms of energy or addressing fresh demand from younger investors who care about social issues, Fink said in an interview with Bloomberg TV at the World Economic Forum in Davos.

Fink famously dedicated a “materially different” 2020 annual letter to shareholders and executives on sustainable investments, which he called the “investment opportunity” of his lifetime and one that will deliver better returns over time.

But this narrative path has not been without its pitfalls.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a likely 2024 Republican presidential candidate, this week moved to prohibit state-run fund managers from taking ESG factors, a into consideration when making investments. Last year, Florida said it moved $2 billion in taxpayer assets from accounts with BlackRock because of ESG.

“Corporations across America continue to inject an ideological agenda through our economy rather than through the ballot box. Today’s actions reinforce that ESG considerations will not be tolerated here in Florida, and I look forward to extending these protections during this legislative session,” DeSantis said in a release.

In a speech, he cranked up the rhetoric, saying his state would “never surrender to the ‘woke’ mob” and that “Florida is where ‘woke’ goes to die.”

A Department of Labor ruling last year removed penalties on retirement-fund and 401(k) managers who consider ESG themes, although maintained that client goals and economic conditions must be given priority.

Texas and select other states have made similar anti-ESG vows. And BlackRock has felt compelled to respond, at least in some fashion. The asset manager, the world’s largest as it topped $10 trillion under its watch, channeled record sums into U.S. political campaigns last year, including an advertising campaign to explain its business focus managing money for retirees. It also brought on additional lobbyists in Texas and on Capitol Hill.

BlackRock said last year that by 2030, it anticipates that at least 75% of its corporate and sovereign assets managed on behalf of clients will be invested in stock and bond issuers with science-based emissions targets. That would be up from 25% currently.

Its rivals, such as Vanguard, have also faced backlash. Vanguard relinquished its membership in a net-zero emissions pact.

BlackRock’s assets under management, which had crossed the $10 trillion threshold in 2021, stood at $8.59 trillion at the end of December despite inflows into its funds during the fourth quarter. The assent manager lost $4 billion in business over ESG bans in 2022, it said, but noted the firm took in $230 billion in new business from U.S. clients over the same period.

High-profile naysayers aren’t making Fink’s initiatives any easier.

In tracking news out of Davos, onetime energy-sector operative and California gubernatorial candidate Michael Shellenberger called out the WEF’s own attention on ESG, to which Tesla TSLA, +0.65% founder Elon Musk offered a colorful response.

Musk, whose electric-vehicle maker Tesla, earned critical ESG marks alleging lack of transparency has called the label a “scam.”

Fink, meanwhile, has also been called out by environmental groups for not dumping traditional energy fast enough.

“We are doing everything we can to change the narrative,” Fink told Bloomberg in the Davos interview, adding that he plans to write a letter to business leaders this quarter that will focus on the “concept of hope.”

Oct 25 (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) has raised $4.5 billion out of an overall $7.5 billion-target for a new fund to invest in infrastructure assets aimed at climate-focused projects, the world's largest asset manager said on Tuesday.

BlackRock, which manages around $8 trillion in assets, said public and private pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, insurance companies and family offices had invested in the new fund, which will be called Global Infrastructure Fund IV.

The asset manager said the new fund will invest in five sectors –– energy, low carbon power, transport and logistics, regulated utilities, and digital infrastructure –– to capitalize on the growing trend towards decarbonization and digitalization.

Its previous infrastructure fund raised $5.1 billion in 2020.

Earlier this month, BlackRock Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink defended his firm's energy investments after facing a backlash from lawmakers critical of its stance on environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues.

BlackRock has faced criticism from many sides in the debate on low-carbon fuels, with environmentalists protesting it does too little to press for change at fossil fuel portfolio companies, and Republican U.S. politicians accusing it of boycotting energy stocks.

The company also recently set up a unit called Transition Capital to invest in opportunities linked to the global shift to a low-carbon economy.

""Our dialogue with clients, CEOs of established and startup companies, and government leaders tells us that they are all looking for even more ways to work directly with BlackRock,"" the memo said.

""They are looking for a trusted partner who can provide the patient and flexible sources of capital to transform their portfolios, businesses, industries, and countries. Our aim is to be the clear global leader.""

The move comes ahead of the next round of global climate talks in Egypt in November, and as policymakers and regulators increasingly push companies and investors to speed up their efforts.

It follows a tough period for BlackRock as its position on climate change has drawn criticism from some right-leaning politicians that it was effectively boycotting fossil fuels, cause of the bulk of man-made greenhouse gas emissions.

At the same time, though, it has also faced criticism from campaigners for not using its position to greater effect by cutting back finance to heavy emitting sectors and helping accelerate change in the real economy.

The new unit will be part of BlackRock Alternatives and run by Dickon Pinner, who previously led on sustainability at consultant McKinsey, where he advised on the transition, the memo said.

Pinner also worked on clean technologies whilst at McKinsey and has experience in the oil and gas industry as a reservoir engineer, the memo said.

Pinner will report jointly to Edwin Conway, Global Head of BlackRock Alternative Investors, and the company's vice-chair, Philipp Hildebrand.

As well as joining the BlackRock Alternatives Executive Committee, Pinner will also sit on senior sustainability committees, the memo said.

BOSTON, Sept 7 (Reuters) - A BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) executive said the top asset manager's work with investment industry groups doesn't prevent it from making independent decisions for clients, looking to counter a growing line of attack from Republican U.S. politicians.

Dalia Blass, BlackRock senior managing director, in a letter sent late Tuesday wrote that ""we do not coordinate our votes or investment decisions with external groups or organizations.""

For instance Blass wrote that when BlackRock joined the Climate Action 100+, an effort among big investors to engage companies on climate change, the firm made clear that it was not agreeing to trade shares or act in concert with other investors to acquire or take control of any company.

Blass' letter was provided to Reuters by a BlackRock representative. It was sent to Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich and a group of other state attorneys general who are among a growing number of Republicans criticizing Wall Street for incorporating environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into investment decisions. read more

The group had written to BlackRock CEO Laurence Fink on Aug. 4 to raise a host of concerns about the fund firm's treatment of energy companies. Among other things the group wrote that ""BlackRock's actions appear to intentionally restrain and harm the competitiveness of the energy markets.""

In her reply BlackRock's Blass also reiterated past arguments that it does not boycott energy companies, and said its participation in ESG initiatives ""is entirely consistent with our fiduciary obligations"" to clients.

With an industry-leading $8.5 trillion under management, largely in passive funds, BlackRock has faced growing right-wing criticism. Last month Texas' comptroller listed the firm as ""boycotting"" energy stocks, putting its business with public funds at risk. read more

At the same time BlackRock has faced pickets at its New York headquarters from environmentalists who say it does too little to cut emissions at big fossil fuel companies where it remains among top owners. read more

In doing so it managed to avoid testifying before a Texas Senate Committee today (Dec. 15), and set itself apart from BlackRock, which has continued to resist pressure from Republicans to drop ESG commitments.

The asset manager’s decision to quit NZAM—which still counts BlackRock and State Street as members—marked a major step away from climate-finance commitments as Republicans intensify pressure on asset managers to re-evaluate their ESG strategies. Though Republicans leading this pressure campaign say they’re concerned taking ESG into account endangers the energy industry and does a disservice to shareholders, critics say the backlash is a politically-motivated move to protect oil and gas companies.

Vanguard quit climate alliance to provide ‘clarity’ to investors

Executives from BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street were all scheduled to answer questions from a Texas Senate committee today about their ESG policies. “Texans deserve to know” how ESG may affect their pension funds, Bryan Hughes, a Republican state senator and chairman of the committee, tweeted.

But Vanguard’s decision to pull out of NZAM appeared to mollify lawmakers, prompting them to excuse the asset manager from appearing at the hearing. In a Dec. 14 letter Hughes said the committee was “encouraged” that Vanguard withdrew from NZAM, but added they would continue to evaluate the asset manager’s ESG practices.

Today the Senate Committee on State Affairs sent a letter to Vanguard excusing them from appearing before the committee at tomorrow’s hearing.

We look forward to discussing the harmful effects that ESG policies have on Texas retirees with Black Rock and State Street.#txlege pic.twitter.com/uOfSSGyMF6 — Senator Bryan Hughes (@SenBryanHughes) December 14, 2022

Vanguard, which joined NZAM last year, said in a Dec. 7 statement it had decided to quit the alliance “after a considerable period of review.”

Initiatives like NZAM “can advance constructive dialogue, but sometimes they can also result in confusion about the views of individual investment firms,” Vanguard said. The firm added it was withdrawing “so that we can provide the clarity our investors desire about the role of index funds,” and to make clear Vanguard “speaks independently” on matters pertinent to investors.

Former vice president Al Gore called Vanguard’s decision “irresponsible,” while Brad Lander, the New York City comptroller, said on Twitter it constituted a “cowardly walkback.”

In a way, Vanguard’s decision is a more honest approach, given 80 percent of its investments are passively managed index funds, said Ken Pucker, a senior lecturer at Tufts University. “They’re not addressing climate change. They’re trying to minimize fees and maximize returns,” he said. “They’re saying, essentially, ‘we’re not about planetary welfare, we’re about optimizing returns.’”

BlackRock stands by ESG commitments

Thus far BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has resisted calls from Republicans to stop factoring climate and social concerns into its investment decisions.

In recent years BlackRock has positioned itself as an industry leader in ESG investing as demand for funds that take these factors into account has soared. But ESG funds like the ones sold by BlackRock have little bearing on climate change, a 2021 Bloomberg investigation found. The ESG rating company BlackRock uses doesn’t take into account a firm’s impact on climate change, but rather the effect of climate risks on their bottom line. Still, that hasn’t stopped states from pledging to pull more than $3 billion collectively from the asset manager in recent months.

BlackRock continues to invest in fossil fuel and has cited more than $100 billion worth of investments in Texas energy companies as proof of that. In June BlackRock CEO Larry Fink told Bloomberg he didn’t want to be the “environmental police,” and said it was wrong to ask the private sector to protect the environment through their work.",Vanguard Splits From BlackRock Over Major Climate Alliance as the Backlash to ESG Builds

Cotton Demands Answers from BlackRock About Involvement with Climate Action 100+, Potential Antitrust Violations

Washington, D.C. — Senator Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas) last night sent a letter to Larry Fink, Chairman and CEO of BlackRock Inc., demanding answers about the firm’s involvement in a scheme to reduce drilling for oil and gas that may violate antitrust law.

In part, Cotton wrote, “BlackRock is an ‘investor participant’ in Climate Action 100+ (‘CA100+’), ‘an investor-led initiative’ to pressure ‘the world’s largest corporate greenhouse gas emitters [to] take necessary action on climate change’ like, for example, pressuring oil companies to drill for less oil. According to CA100+, ‘investor participants’ are ‘signatories to the initiative and are responsible for direct engagements with focus companies’ that directly compete with one another.”

“Your anti-drilling coercion threatens our national security, hurts Americans struggling to buy a tank of gas, and appears to violate antitrust laws. Specifically, by engaging with competing ‘focus companies,’ CA100+ investor participants appear to be running a spoke-and-hub conspiracy to restrict the supply of fossil fuels and impose various other unlawful restraints on trade. By ‘collaborating’ with other investors, you and your fellow CA100+ investor participants appear to be acting like a climate cartel,” Cotton continued.

Text of the letter may be found here and below.

Dear Mr. Fink,

I'm writing about your involvement in a scheme to reduce drilling for oil and gas.

BlackRock is an ""investor participant"" in Climate Action 100+ (""CA100+""), ""an investor-led initiative"" to pressure ""the world's largest corporate greenhouse gas emitters [to] take necessary action on climate change"" like, for example, pressuring oil companies to drill for less oil. According to CA100+, ""investor participants"" are ""signatories to the initiative and are responsible for direct engagements with focus companies"" that directly compete with one another.

By ""collaborating"" with other investors, you and your fellow CA100+ investor participants appear to be acting like a climate cartel.

In light of the growing concerns about anti-competitive ESG activities, many law firms have begun offering antitrust counsel to clients participating in initiatives like CA100+.

Please provide answers to the following questions by July 20, 2022:

Has BlackRock engaged with any focus companies as part of the CA100+ initiative? If so, please list each focus company. Has BlackRock collaborated with any other investor participants as part of the CA100+ initiative? If so, please list each investor participant.

BlackRock , the largest asset manager in the world, said it will likely vote to support fewer climate proposals from companies in its investment portfolio in 2022 than it did in 2021 because those climate proposals coming up for a vote this year are more exacting and demanding than in previous years.

On Tuesday, BlackRock's Investment Stewardship team published a preview of how it's going to vote in the current season of company shareholding meetings. Blackrock's Investment Stewardship (BIS) is a team of financial professionals that liaises between corporate governance of the companies it invests in for the benefit of its clients.

In 2021, BlackRock voted in favor of 47% of environmental and social shareholder proposals (81 of 172), the BIS said in its note.

In the current season, BlackRock is ""likely to support proportionately fewer this proxy season than in 2021, as we do not consider them to be consistent with our clients' long-term financial interests,"" the BIS note says.

BlackRock will not vote for company changes that ""implicitly are intended to micromanage companies,"" BIS said. ""This includes those that are unduly prescriptive and constraining on the decision-making of the board or management, call for changes to a company's strategy or business model, or address matters that are not material to how a company delivers long-term shareholder value.""

Instead, BlackRock will favor measures which improve a company's disclosure of information that help investors understand how well a company is positioned to adapt to climate-related changes.

The chief investment officers of United Kingdom-based Bluebell Capital Partners accused CEO Larry Fink on Tuesday of repeatedly failing to live up to his stated sustainability commitments.

BlackRock’s combination of increased rhetoric around sustainability with continued funding of fossil fuels like coal created a worst-of-all-worlds situation for sustainable investing, Bluebell chief investment officers Giuseppe Bivona and Marco Taricco wrote.

In its letter published on Tuesday, Bluebell is concerned about “the gap between what BlackRock consistently says on ESG and what they actually do,” Bivona told CNBC, referring to environment, social and governance-focused (ESG) investing.

“We see BlackRock endorsing a number of bad practices from a governance, social and environmental perspective which is not actually in tune with what they say,” Bivona added.

The letter comes amid a widespread reaction from U.S. Republicans against ESG investing in general and BlackRock in particular.

Florida just followed Texas, Missouri and Louisiana in pulling billions of dollars in state assets from management by BlackRock.

In a January letter to investors, Fink defended the company against accusations by conservatives that BlackRock was using its economic power for political ends — arguing that sustainability was good business.

But Fink also defended BlackRock’s continued investment in climate-harming fossil fuel companies. In the January letter, he wrote at length about the importance of remaining invested in problematic companies as a means of maintaining influence over their activities — which would be lost under divestment.

“Divesting from entire sectors — or simply passing carbon-intensive assets from public markets to private markets — will not get the world to net zero,” Fink wrote.

As conservative attacks on ESG heated up, BlackRock released a fact sheet boasting its investment of $170 billion in U.S. public energy companies, ”including pipelines and power generation facilities.”

This sort of careful tightrope-walking has meant “reputational risk (including greenwashing risk) to which BlackRock under the leadership of Larry Fink have unreasonably exposed the company,” Bivona and Taricco wrote the company in a now-public November letter.

“The contradictions and apparent hypocrisy of BlackRock’s actions have . . . politicized the ESG debate,” Bivona and Taricco wrote.

“The reputational damage of being dragged into this politically charged debate, in our view, is very significant because it calls into question the independence of BlackRock as an asset manager.”

While BlackRock is the largest member of the Net Zero Asset Manager Initiative, it is still a major investor in coal, oil and gas, according to an April report from Reclaim Finance.

BlackRock holds $133 billion in oil and gas investments, Reclaim reported.

And along with large asset manager Vanguard, BlackRock also holds $60 billion in coal, per Reclaim.

In particular, BlackRock’s continued investment in Glencore — the world’s 11th largest coal producer — shows why “BlackRock most embodies the hypocrisy of too many asset managers,” Lara Cuvelier of Reclaim Finance said in a statement at the time.

BlackRock’s framing of the fossil fuel debate as “divestment versus engagement,” was overly simplistic, according to Reclaim.

“Pitting engagement and exclusion as diametrically opposing practices is at best misguided and at worst a deliberate strategy to avoid exclusion,” the report wrote.

“In fact, the most effective investors use exclusion and divestment and the threat of future divestment as a cudgel to enhance their engagement efforts,” Reclaim added.

Members of “engagement-first” groups like the Net Zero Asset Manager Initiative voted against almost a third of environmental resolutions at the companies they invested in, according to a 2021 study by activist group ShareAction.

One particular example helped lead for Bluebell’s current call for Fink’s ouster.

In April, BlackRock’s refusal to back sustainability proposals that Bluebell — which has a 0.01 percent stake in the asset manager — called for at companies like the mining giant Glencore, according to the Financial Times.

Specifically, BlackRock refused to support Bluebell’s February shareholder resolution that sought to force Glencore to spin off its thermal coal business, which produces coal for power plants.

“Due to its coal business, Glencore is not an investible company for investors who place sustainability at the heart of their investment process,” Taricco and Bivona wrote in 2021, according to Bloomberg.

“A clear separation between carbonized and de-carbonized assets is needed to increase shareholder value and remove the ‘coal discount’, whilst simultaneously ensuring that coal assets will be managed responsibly.”

While Fink has often warned of the dangers of divestment, this was not a principled stance, Bivona told CNBC.

“Let me say that when the price of coal was around $76 per ton, BlackRock was talking about essentially divesting,” he said.

“Now that the price of coal is $380 per ton, they are talking about responsible ownership. I think there is a high correlation between BlackRock’s strategy on coal and the price of coal,” Bivona added.

BlackRock pushed back — albeit in a manner that essentially agreed with Bluebell’s description of their vote as primarily financial.

“In the past 18 months, Bluebell has waged a number of campaigns to promote their climate and governance agenda. BlackRock Investment Stewardship did not support their campaigns as we did not consider them to be in the best economic interests of our clients,” BlackRock representatives wrote in a statement.

But Bluebell has managed to make big waves at other companies where it had only a relatively small investment, the Financial Times reported.

The activist investors successfully deposed the chief executive at Danone last year, according to Financial Times.","Activist investors blast BlackRock’s ‘hypocrisy’ on sustainability, call for CEO ouster"

Climate activists have gathered inside the headquarters of financial investment firm BlackRock to protest the company’s investment in fossil fuels.

This is the third straight day of climate protests in New York City, led by activist groups like New York Communities for Change (NYCC) and the New York chapters of the Sunrise Movement and Extinction Rebellion.

Video shows activists sitting down in front of escalators in the building holding banners that read things like “How dare you plunder the Earth?” and “Your greed = climate chaos.”

The activists say that they’ve spread coal on the floor in front of the sit-in.

BlackRock, the world’s largest investment firm, has trillions of dollars in assets across many different companies, including fossil fuel companies. The Independent has contacted a representative for the firm for comment.

A spokesperson for the NYPD told The Independent that by noon, the protest had been cleared and 10 people had been arrested.

At 5am on Wednesday morning, protestors also gathered outside the New York home of Scott Nuttall, one of the CEOs of investment firm KKR, to protest that company’s investment in fossil fuels. The Independent has contacted a representative from KRR for comment.

On Monday, activists interrupted an interview of Senator Ted Cruz on The View to protest the Texas Republican’s appearance and ABC’s coverage of the climate crisis. On Tuesday, protestors blocked all lanes of traffic on Manhattan’s Park Avenue, home to many of the city’s wealthiest residents, leading to 15 arrests.

Alice Hu, a climate campaigner with NYCC, told The Independent on Tuesday that these are part of a weeklong series of protests along Park Avenue to highlight “billionaires and corporations for their outsized role in driving the climate and inequality crises.”

The protests also come 10 years after Hurricane Sandy hit the area, bringing widespread devastation and killing more than 50 people in New York alone.

“10 years ago Hurricane Sandy hit New York displacing tens of thousands of New Yorkers,” NYCC tweeted on Wednesday. They added that the climate crisis and housing issues have since gotten worse — and demanded that New York Governor Kathy Hochul “#TaxTheRich for green housing for all.”

“Green housing” refers to the concept of homes and apartments that emit few or no carbon emissions, such as through installing solar panels for energy or eschewing fossil fuels for more climate-friendly heating options like electric heat pumps.

Climate protests have also gone into high gear in the UK, where the activist group Just Stop Oil has done a series of actions to highlight the crisis, including smearing cake on a wax figure of King Charles III, throwing soup at a glass-covered Van Gogh painting in a museum and spraying an oil-lobbying firm’s headquarters with paint.

Fancy, who was chief investment officer for sustainable investing between January 2018 and September 2019, said his former boss is an “emperor with no clothes” who is “ducking the fight” on ESG in an interview with The Telegraph.

“Larry Fink should stop ducking the fight and enter the [ESG] debate to clarify what he’s saying. If he is not going to do that then he should resign,” he said.

“You cannot show the world that the emperor has no clothes if he locks himself in the bathroom and does not come out.”

The criticism comes just over a week after activist investor BlueBall Capital Partners also called on Fink to resign over the “hypocrisy” of his approach to ESG.

Furthermore, BlackRock continues to face criticism from the Republican states in the US, many of which have implemented Boycott Acts against firms excluding certain activities from their investment products on ESG grounds.

Fancy added: “BlackRock’s biggest mistake was getting involved in political issues. When they started talking about ESG, it was not objective, it was intended to sell to progressives.

“They have now found themselves in a place where they are a political football and there is no way to satisfy either side.”

A spokesperson for BlackRock told The Telegraph: “Tariq Fancy has been gone from BlackRock longer than he spent at the firm but three years later continues to trade on BlackRock’s name.

“It is absurd that he would suggest a chief executive step down who has delivered a cumulative total return to shareholders over 23 years of 7,700% – the best performing financial firm in the S&P over that time – by consistently putting clients’ interests first.

“The money BlackRock manages does not belong to Tariq Fancy or anyone else with a political agenda – it belongs to our clients. We will continue to manage that money consistent with their long-term goals and objectives, not those of Tariq Fancy.”

Earlier this month, Vanguard withdrew from the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative, stating it wants to improve clarity for investors.

Mehta will run the BlackRock Global Markets Group, overseeing trading, lending and other functions around the firm's relationship with Wall Street. Mr. Mehta stepped into the human resources role in a moment of crisis for the department when an earlier HR chief was fired for violating company policy following an office romance.

Wednesday's changes come at a pivotal time for BlackRock, which remains in political crossfire over its sustainability-minded investment products. Republican lawmakers and governors have retaliated against ESG efforts, and Democratic leaders and pundits have chastised the $8 trillion asset manager for holding large stakes in companies that pollute and manufacture guns.

""The actions we announced today and in October will deepen our connections with clients, further strengthen our investment platform and promote BlackRock's next generation of leaders,"" Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink and President Rob Kapito wrote in the memo.

Joud Abdel Majeid, previously deputy chief financial officer, will succeed Ms. Boss as head of investment stewardship, a position that's increasingly visible as sustainability issues foment in Washington.

In other changes to the client group, Armando Senra will take over BlackRock's institutional business in the Americas. Dominik Rohe will replace Mr. Senra as head of the Americas iShares and index business.

BlackRock also altered its global executive committee.

Several women were added to the senior group. Ms. Majeid and Caroline Heller, who's replacing Mr. Mehta atop the human resources department, will both join the group, along with deputy head of Asia-Pacific Susan Chan, and chief investment officer of ETF & index investments Samara Cohen. Two senior investment officials, Rick Rieder and Raffaele Savi, will also join.

Some leaders will step away from the global executive committee — potentially pointing to changes to who's in the running to succeed Fink, 70, in the event of his retirement. Gary Shedlin and Mark McCombe — both in transition to vice chairmen roles — will step down from the group that steers key decisions at the firm, as will existing Vice Chairman Rob Fairbairn.",BlackRock overhauls leadership for sustainability and markets roles

Below is the text of the letter with minor adjustments to eliminate the correspondence-related parts.

BlackRock manages assets on behalf of institutional and individual clients worldwide, across equity, fixed income, liquidity, alternatives, and multi-asset strategies. Our clients, the asset owners, include pension plans, endowments, foundations, charities, official institutions, insurers and other financial institutions, as well as individuals around the world. Because our clients have diverse financial objectives, we consider a variety of investment factors, risks, and opportunities, including those related to climate.

Asset managers investing on behalf of clients are not just looking for more data on climate risk; they need high-quality information that is (1) relevant to understanding climate- related risks and opportunities, and (2) reliable, timely, and comparable across jurisdictions. Investors also recognize that climate data, controls and risk methodologies are still evolving. As a fiduciary to our clients, BlackRock has engaged with public companies on climate disclosure over the past five years. We have observed these companies continually developing and adapting their climate risk management and reporting tools, improving the quality of their disclosure over time.

BlackRock strongly supports the ISSB’s goal of providing a global baseline of standards to support the disclosure of more reliable, comparable, and consistent climate-related information. We view both the ISSB Exposure Draft ED/2022/S1 on sustainability-related financial information and ED/2022/S2 on climate-related disclosure as important contributions to a multi-year, multi-jurisdictional effort towards improving the availability, quality, comparability, timeliness, and interoperability of sustainability-related disclosures.

We have separately responded to the ED/2022/S1 on sustainability-related financial information. Our comments below are intended to propose aligning the ED/2022/S2 on climate-related disclosure with the following principles, which we believe will provide investors with high-quality disclosures, while creating the flexibility necessary for continuing development of creative, pragmatic best practices. These principles have similarly guided BlackRock’s response to the climate-related disclosure rules proposed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures for Investors.

While national authorities will ultimately determine the application and scope of ISSB-aligned standards (including the associated liability framework) in their jurisdiction, we encourage the ISSB to continue engaging with global regulators, as well as other standard setters, to ensure interoperability and alignment with the principles outlined below.

Principles for High-Quality Climate-Related Disclosures

TCFD alignment: We support disclosure frameworks aligned with the TCFD framework and sector-specific metrics, such as those that will be taken forward by the ISSB. The TCFD framework has incorporated market feedback and attracted widespread support because of its relative simplicity and Our experience is that it results in clear disclosures that allow investors to assess how companies are adapting their business models to respond to climate-related risks and would provide an effective global framework.

We urge regulators to work with market participants and standard setters, like the ISSB, to continue developing industry-specific guidance.

We strongly support a global baseline of climate-related disclosure standards to enable investors to make more informed decisions. We urge regulators to work with market participants and standard setters, like the ISSB, to continue developing industry-specific guidance. Flexible approach to improving disclosures: We believe that regulators should allow for a “comply or explain” regime (consistent with the TCFD framework) for disclosure areas, such as certain metrics and targets, that are still actively evolving. This regime will allow companies to provide the disclosures or explain why they cannot. A flexible approach to disclosure will likely encourage more and more companies to provide such disclosures.

This regime will allow companies to provide the disclosures or explain why they cannot. A flexible approach to disclosure will likely encourage more and more companies to provide such disclosures. Distinction between Scope 1&2, and Scope 3 disclosures: We support quantitative disclosure aligned with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (“GHG Protocol”). As investors, we use GHG emissions estimates to size an issuer’s climate-related exposure. Specifically, we look to companies to provide Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions disclosures, and meaningful short-, medium-, and long-term science-based reductions targets, where available for their sector. As investors, we use Scope 3 emissions as a proxy metric (among others) for the degree of exposure companies have to carbon-intensive business models and technologies. However, we do not believe the purpose of Scope 3 disclosure requirements should be to push publicly traded companies into the role of enforcing emission reduction targets outside of their control. Given methodological complexity for Scope 3 emissions and the lack of direct control by companies over the requisite data, our investors believe the usefulness of this disclosure varies significantly right now across industries and Scope 3 emissions categories. We encourage regulators to adopt a disclosure framework that accounts for this significant variation. Under this framework, companies would disclose emissions estimates for any of the fifteen Scope 3 categories that are material to them. If none of the fifteen categories are material, or if companies are not yet capable of estimating their Scope 3 emissions, they would have the option of explaining why that is the case.

Consistency across public and private markets: Mandating reporting by companies across both public and private markets is critical to averting unintended consequences in the capital markets such as (1) the sale of physical assets to private companies to avoid disclosure, and (2) private companies being potentially disincentivized from going public, decreasing choice for public market investors. Uniform disclosures would also provide market participants with a clearer understanding of how the transition to a lower carbon economy is progressing across the entire economy. The absence of consistent private and public market disclosure standards forces public companies to step into the role of policing their value chain partners and clients through negotiating the implementation and monitoring of the data they need for their own disclosures, such as private companies’ GHG emissions

We urge regulators to adopt a liability framework that provides meaningful protection from legal liability for disclosures provided in good faith while standards continue to evolve, and that gives companies the flexibility they need to develop their disclosures without imposing a chilling Adequate time for companies to develop high-quality disclosures: Climate-related disclosures often require companies to collect and aggregate data from various internal and external sources. Practical realities of data-collection and reporting do not cleanly line up with financial reporting cycles. Giving companies adequate time (e.g., 120 days) after their fiscal year-end to accurately collect and analyze this data will increase the quality of the climate related information investors receive. This timeline should still result in companies producing climate-related data in advance of their annual meetings, giving investors time to assess it before making proxy voting decisions.

Adhering to relevant materiality thresholds: Finally, we believe companies’ climate- related disclosure obligations in their annual and quarterly reports should be linked to relevant materiality thresholds. Materiality thresholds will assist investors in identifying those companies that consider climate-related risks material to their operations and in evaluating the impact of those risks on companies.

Response to Exposure Draft ED/2022/S2 Climate-related Disclosures

As an investor, BlackRock has been pleased to observe that an increasing number of issuers are using the TCFD framework to provide more detail to their stakeholders through disclosures that are becoming increasingly robust over time. We welcome the ISSB’s alignment with the core principles of the TCFD framework. We strongly support the ISSB’s objective of building a single, global set of baseline sustainability reporting standards on which jurisdictions can build, to accelerate the disclosure of more comparable climate- related information.

The ISSB’s proposed standard for climate-related disclosures will benefit investors and other stakeholders by increasing the quality of information available. We believe this will assist us and other investors in evaluating the material impact of climate risk on particular issuers and in identifying those issuers that consider climate-related risks and opportunities material to their operations. We believe that the proposal sets forth an important roadmap to inform disclosure decisions on climate-risk oversight, strategy, governance, and risk management and will compel issuers to conduct a more thorough analysis than currently undertaken under the existing voluntary framework alone.

Setting out clear international guidelines around these disclosures will help level the playing field for all issuers and, over time, help reduce costs in complying with multiple reporting frameworks. In order to enable issuers to build the appropriate processes and controls to comply, the effective date should be no less than one full year after the standards are finalized.

In offering our support for the ISSB’s efforts to provide a baseline global standard for climate-related disclosure, we are submitting the following specific recommendations, which we believe will allow the final guidance to promote reliable, comparable, and consistent disclosures.

Disclosure of climate-related information in general purpose financial reporting

The ISSB’s exposure draft for climate-related disclosure refers to a company’s ‘general- purpose financial reporting’ as the location that this information should be published. However, given the diversity among national reporting regimes, ‘general purpose financial reporting’ may entail different practical conditions and associated liability per jurisdiction.

Timing: Defining the reporting location as a company’s ‘general purpose financial reporting’ also effectively determines the timing of climate-related disclosure. However, the practical realities of the collection and reporting of climate-related data do not cleanly line up with financial reporting cycles. Climate-related disclosures often require companies to collect and aggregate data from various internal and external sources. As an investor, what we view as most important is ensuring that companies produce climate-related disclosure in advance of their annual meetings, giving investors time to assess the information before making proxy voting decisions. Giving companies adequate time (e.g., 120 days) after their fiscal year-end to accurately collect and analyze this data will increase the quality of the climate-related information investors receive.

Giving companies adequate time (e.g., 120 days) after their fiscal year-end to accurately collect and analyze this data will increase the quality of the climate-related information investors receive. Liability: We recognise that the liability attached to general-purpose financial reporting will depend on national regimes, and consequently the ISSB’s requirement to locate climate-related disclosure within that report will in turn result in differing liability in different jurisdictions. In our view, liability should be commensurate with the evolving nature of climate-related disclosure, to encourage rather than discourage higher- quality disclosure. We urge national regulators to adopt liability frameworks that provide meaningful protection from legal liability for disclosures provided in good faith while standards continue to evolve (for example, in some jurisdictions this may be provided in the form of a safe harbour from liability), and that gives companies the flexibility they need to develop their disclosures without imposing a chilling We recognize that in certain national regimes, this may result in climate-related disclosure being located outside of general purpose financial reporting.

Materiality: Further, while we note that the ISSB Exposure Draft ED/2022/S1 on sustainability-related financial information defines material information in alignment with the definition in the International Accounting Standards Board’s (IASB’s) Conceptual Framework for General Purpose Financial Reporting, in our view, materiality should be determined according to the definition most relevant to each jurisdiction’s wider reporting framework.

Permitting disclosure in the location best aligned with the liability considerations relevant to a specific national jurisdiction, whether or not that is inside of the general purpose financial reporting, will encourage issuers to make more robust climate-related disclosures (including with respect to newly implemented emission targets, scenario analyses and transition plans). Providing issuers with more time after the deadline of their general purpose financial reporting to prepare the information required will also increase the quality and accuracy of the climate-related information that investors receive.

For companies subject to reporting requirements in multiple jurisdictions, providing the option to cross refer to comparable reporting at parent company level may increase the efficiency of disclosure in some instances, and support the transparent disclosure of climate-related risks and opportunities to investors.

Further, explicitly permitting the use of prior quarter estimates could support more timely disclosure by issuers.

GHG emissions disclosure

As an investor, we believe that climate risk is investment risk, and we strive to help our clients make the most informed choices to improve their investment outcomes. We welcome the efforts of the ISSB to draw on the TCFD framework and the GHG Protocol in determining what climate-related information issuers should disclose. We encourage the ISSB to engage with regulators and market participants to provide additional industry-specific guidance on which gases are likely to be material, and how materiality should be evaluated.

Recognizing that relevant data and methodologies are still emerging, we recommend that the ISSB take a flexible approach to GHG emissions disclosures.

Scope 1 and 2 GHG Emissions. We support requiring issuers to disclose their Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions estimates regardless of materiality, as this information helps investors assess exposure to climate-related risks and opportunities across a variety of sectors. However, given the methodological and estimation challenges issuers face today in collecting Scope 1 and 2 data on a timely basis, we are of the view that it is impracticable to require this information to be disclosed or ‘filed’ in general-purpose financial reporting on the annual report timeline, even if material, although that may change over time as these challenges abate. In our response to the SEC’s proposed climate-related disclosure framework, we have included a proposal for a New Form through which issuers could ‘furnish’ all GHG emissions data, given these methodological and estimation challenges. We encourage the ISSB to permit Scope 1 and 2 disclosures—where material—to be incorporated by reference from an appropriate alternative reporting location instead of requiring that it be included in a company’s general purpose financial reporting, unless a robust safe harbor can be provided to afford meaningful protection from liability for Scope 1 and 2 disclosures included in a company’s general purpose financial reporting .

Scope 3 GHG Emissions. As we have said previously, at this stage, we view Scope 3 emissions differently from Scope 1 and 2, given the methodological complexity and lack of direct control by companies over the requisite data to assess Scope 3 emissions. In our experience as investors, these issues, and the usefulness of Scope 3 disclosures more generally, vary significantly across industries and the 15 categories of Scope 3 emissions. We support a ‘comply or explain’ approach to disclosure of Scope 3 in an appropriate alternative reporting location outside of a company’s general-purpose financial reporting, allowing issuers to either disclose material Scope 3 emissions or explain why certain emissions categories are not relevant to the issuer or not subject to reasonable estimation.

As investors, we believe it is important to be able to evaluate companies’ assessments of their emissions across their value chain, or Scope 3 emissions, as such emissions could affect the economic viability of issuers’ business models. Climate risk and the economic opportunities from the transition are a top concern for our clients and a rapidly growing share of them have already committed to net-zero aligned portfolios. As investors, we use Scope 3 emissions as a proxy metric (among others) for the degree of exposure companies have to carbon-intensive business models and technologies. However, we do not believe the purpose of Scope 3 disclosure requirements should be to push publicly traded companies into the role of enforcing emission reduction targets outside of their

Further, as recognized by the US SEC in its proposal The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures for Investors, “the methodologies pertaining to the measurement of GHG emissions, particularly Scope 3 emissions, are evolving,” and with the broader adoption of reporting standards, data sets, and methodologies, they will improve meaningfully further.12 This evolution will require effort on the part of standard setters to provide the further guidance necessary for these disclosures to be reliable and consistent for investors, including with respect to materiality and the appropriate calculation methodology for each category of Scope 3 emissions.

A flexible approach to rulemaking based on a “comply or explain” approach, compared to mandating complete Scope 3 disclosures within general purpose financial reporting before most issuers have the requisite capability, will provide issuers the opportunity to develop the resources necessary to comply with industry standards and best practices as they

AUM Associated Emissions: We support the separate disclosure of GHG emissions associated with assets under management (“AUM”) on behalf of external clients, and encourage the ISSB to specify a methodology to support consistent disclosure. However, while BlackRock reports AUM associated emissions based on the PCAF framework, we note that data, controls and methodologies for computing GHG emissions associated with some asset classes are still emerging, and flexibility will be needed as this area develop.

Whole-of-board approach to governance of climate-related risks and opportunities

We support the objective of enabling a company’s stakeholders to understand the governance processes, controls and procedures used to monitor and manage climate- related risks and opportunities, building on the recommendations of TCFD.

However, in our view, robust oversight with respect to climate-related risks and opportunities requires a whole-of-the-board approach. While we recognize and appreciate that a dedicated committee of the board can be beneficial, especially for companies where climate risk and opportunities are material, the formation of such a committee should be at the discretion of the board. We do not think it is conducive to a holistic approach or, in some cases, appropriate to require companies to disclose the identity of an individual responsible for oversight of climate-related risks and opportunities.

Assessing and managing climate-related risks and opportunities is the purview of management, subject to appropriate board oversight. However, we do not believe issuers should be required to disclose specific details regarding management’s process, but should instead consider which elements of its climate-related governance and risk oversight processes are relevant to its investors. Prescribing a more granular level of disclosures would likely require issuers to disclose a large volume of information that is, on the one hand, unlikely to be material for investors, and on the other hand, may be competitively sensitive for issuers.

Climate resilience, and the evolution of scenario analysis

Where issuers choose to prepare and disclose scenario analysis, this may help a company’s stakeholders assess the climate resilience of its strategy. However, we note that for all issuers, regardless of industry, climate-related scenario analysis has proven to be one of the most challenging aspects of the TCFD recommendations.

Predicting climate change and quantifying its impacts on companies and the economy is inherently complex. We acknowledge the current lack of uniformity across issuers in various industry sectors on the (i) most appropriate climate-related assumptions to use, (ii)

scenarios against which analysis should be conducted, and (iii) client response assumptions to utilize.

Until there is further evolution leading to consistency in climate scenario analysis, the current disclosure landscape is not ready for a mandatory approach to climate-related scenario analysis. We find a “comply or explain” approach consistent with the TCFD framework. to be most appropriate at this time. A flexible approach to disclosure will likely encourage more and more companies to provide such disclosures.

Encouraging climate-related disclosure by private companies

At present, climate-related information with respect to private issuers is lacking in comparison to what is increasingly available from public issuers. To avoid regulatory arbitrage between public and private market climate-related disclosures, we believe that climate-related disclosure mandates should not be limited to public issuers, but should include private companies above an appropriate threshold. Therefore, we encourage national authorities building on the ISSB baseline standard for climate-related disclosure to find innovative ways to include the private markets in their reporting frameworks.

Conclusion

BlackRock strongly supports the ISSB’s goal of providing a global baseline of standards, to support the disclosure of more reliable, comparable, and consistent climate-related information, aligned with the TCFD framework. We view both the ISSB Exposure Draft ED/2022/S1 on sustainability-related financial information and ED/2022/S2 on climate- related disclosure as important contributions to a multi-year, multi-jurisdictional effort towards improving the availability, quality, comparability, timeliness, and interoperability of sustainability related disclosures.

Our recommendations are intended to support the objective set out by the ISSB to promote reliable, comparable, and consistent disclosures. Given the diversity among national reporting regimes, ‘general purpose financial reporting’ may entail different practical conditions and associated liability in different jurisdictions. Therefore, permitting disclosure in the location best aligned with the liability considerations relevant to a specific national jurisdiction will encourage issuers to make more robust climate-related disclosures. For companies subject to reporting requirements in multiple jurisdictions, providing the option to cross refer to comparable reporting at the parent company level, even if outside its general purpose financial reporting, may increase the efficiency of disclosure in some instances, and support the transparent disclosure of climate-related risks and opportunities to investors.

While national authorities will ultimately determine the application and scope of ISSB- aligned standards (including the associated liability framework) in their jurisdiction, we encourage the ISSB to continue engaging with global regulators, as well as other standard setters, to ensure interoperability and alignment with the recommendations outlined above, and to find innovative ways to include the private markets in their reporting frameworks.

Summary Companies Cites May 10 report on climate proxy voting plans

Says BlackRock is not acting in its long-term interests

Says it has put relationship with money manager 'on watch'















LONDON/BOSTON, May 24 (Reuters) - Leading U.S. environmental group the Sierra Club has warned BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) it may pull a $12 million investment after the money manager said it would likely support fewer climate-focused shareholder resolutions at annual company meetings this year.

The world's biggest asset manager said this month it was less likely to support such votes as many were too prescriptive in their demands and not in the interests of clients. read more

The Sierra Club Foundation believes the asset manager's stance put it at odds with the goal of mitigating the harms of climate change, it said in a May 24 letter to BlackRock Chief Executive Larry Fink and other executives seen by Reuters.

The Foundation, which oversees some $220 million in assets, currently invests with BlackRock through Aperio, a unit that runs managed accounts.

""With this publication, we have come to conclude that BlackRock and Aperio are not acting in Sierra Club Foundation’s long-term financial and mission-related interests,"" Dan Chu, executive director at the Foundation, and several colleagues, said in the letter.

A BlackRock spokesman said the company's proxy votes are ""based solely on the long-term economic interests of our clients."" BlackRock also allows many investors to chose how their proxy votes are cast, including clients of Aperio, the spokesman said.

BlackRock has sought to position itself as a leader in sustainable investing, but its efforts have drawn criticism from U.S. clients on various sides of issues like climate change which have grown more politicised. read more

On CNBC on Tuesday, U.S. Senator Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican, criticized BlackRock's Fink for what Cruz said was his ""massive and inappropriate ESG pressure.""

The letter from Sierra Club leaders said part of their purpose is to mitigate harms of climate change. BlackRock's ""work in this regard hardly assists us in our fiduciary duties, and in fact, runs counter to them.""

Oklahoma State Treasurer Todd Russ, a Republican, sent a questionnaire to Wall Street firms BlackRock, JPMorgan, State Street, Vanguard and dozens of others that will determine which corporations “boycott energy companies” because of the engagement in environmental, social and governance investing, or ESG.

Oklahoma will cease business and divest pension funds, such as the Oklahoma Public Retirement System and the Teachers Retirement System, from the companies that answer favorably toward ESG.

The move is part of a broader endeavor by red states across the country to combat ESG, which GOP officials say threatens fossil fuels and energy companies vital to their state economies.

Behemoth asset manager BlackRock is at risk of losing $10 billion alone for managing the state’s Public Retirement System, Mr. Russ warned. Other states last year cumulatively divested more than $4 billion from the firm, political pressure that pales vs. its more than $8 trillion assets under management, but that has forced the company to go on defense.

“After review, your company may appear on the State of Oklahoma’s list of financial companies that boycott energy companies,” Mr. Russ wrote to the firms in a letter attached with the questionnaire. “Such a listing will prohibit Oklahoma governmental entities from investing in and may potentially require divestment from your company, your company’s affiliates and subsidiaries, or investment vehicles affiliated with your company, its affiliates or subsidiaries.”

The questionnaire does not mention ESG directly but poses dozens of related questions, including whether the corporations have any environmental pledges, if they’re members of the financial climate alliance Net Zero Asset Managers initiative and what their investment policies are regarding fossil fuels.

“I took office on January 9th and began compiling a list of companies, banks and other entities that act against Oklahoma’s interests because of their ESG stance,” Mr. Russ said in a statement. “It is my responsibility to ensure Oklahoman’s tax dollars will not be used to enrich organizations that act counter to our taxpayers’ interests and our values.”

Some of the largest targeted companies, including Vanguard, State Street and JPMorgan, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

BlackRock rejected the accusation it “boycotts” energy companies, telling The Washington Times that it currently has more than $200 billion invested in fossil fuels on behalf of clients in Oklahoma and elsewhere.

“BlackRock’s sole focus is delivering the best long-term financial results consistent with our clients’ investment goals,” a spokesperson said in a statement. “We look forward to engaging with the Oklahoma treasurer to discuss how BlackRock serves our clients’ interests in Oklahoma and elsewhere, including over $20 billion of investments in Oklahoma-based public companies made on behalf of our clients and managing public pensions for more than 73,000 Oklahoma beneficiaries.”



Mr. Russ‘ list was composed of 181 finance firms, which have 60 days to respond. No response will result in automatic divestment or termination of state business.

The anti-ESG action follows an Oklahoma law, the Energy Discrimination Elimination Act, that took effect last year. It requires the state treasurer to determine which financial companies are anti-fossil fuels and bar them from managing public funds.

The letter, which was addressed to lawmakers who lead committees on banking and financial services, comes several months after Republican attorneys general criticized asset manager BlackRock for using ESG to guide investments for state pensions.

Republicans are likely to target ESG investing when they assume control of the House of Representatives in January. Patrick McHenry, a Republican congressman from North Carolina who is expected to chair the House Financial Services committee when his party takes over, has spoken out against efforts by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to require companies to disclose information related to climate change.

In recent years more asset managers have started to consider ESG—a broad term that refers to a set of principles relevant to socially conscious investors—in their investment decisions. Half of all professionally managed assets globally will take ESG issues into account, whether through investment selection or shareholder resolutions, by 2024, according to Deloitte. BlackRock, for its part, has incorporated sustainability-related information into its investment process since 2020, recognizing that “climate risk is investment risk.” In an Aug. 4 letter Republican attorneys general called out BlackRock for the practice, arguing the firm uses the “hard-earned money of our states’ citizens to circumvent the best possible return on investment” by considering sustainability.

But the 17 Democratic attorneys general from states including New York and California disagree, arguing in their letter to Congress that “consideration of ESG factors yields important information about risks and rewards, which leads to greater value for beneficiaries.” Companies that fail to take climate change risks into account, for example, “can suffer serious financial consequences” due to physical damage, litigation, or regulatory costs, the letter continues.

Investment firms and companies have gotten plenty of flack for not being transparent enough about their ESG strategies, the attorneys general concede. Firms that rate companies for their ESG commitments have been criticized for prioritizing financial returns over the actual real-world impact of their investments. For example, even though McDonald’s received a higher ESG rating in 2021 for its commitment to save money by reducing packaging material and waste, its overall greenhouse gas emissions increased between 2015 and 2019. Emissions levels didn’t factor into the ESG upgrade awarded to the company.

The SEC has proposed amendments to rules and reporting forms that would establish disclosure requirements for funds and advisers that market themselves as having an ESG focus.",Democratic AGs Defend ESG Strategies After Republicans Pressure BlackRock to Drop Sustainability Principles

Covering the annual meeting season through July, last month's report reveals BlackRock supported just 24 percent of environmental and social shareholder proposals at U.S. companies over the period, marking a major drop from the 43 percent it voted in favor of the previous year.

Given the number of sustainability-focused proposals put forward by shareholders at BlackRock-managed companies rose by 133 percent over the period, it means the number it backed fell from 81 proposals last proxy season to just 71 this year, the report reveals.

In the introduction to the report, Sandy Boss, global head of investment stewardship at the asset manager, claimed shareholder proposals had become ""less supportable"" in the 2021-22 proxy year due to a number of factors.

BlackRock said the decline suggested that 'most investors took a measured, materiality-based approach in their analysis and voting on proposals this proxy year.

Interventions proposed by shareholders had been more prescriptive than in prior years, she said, noting that many sought to ""dictate the pace of companies' transition plans … with little regard to company financial performance."" Other proposals, she noted, had failed to recognize that companies ""had largely already met their ask.""

""This proxy season underscored our belief that a constructive stewardship approach contributes to companies making meaningful progress in their climate-related planning and disclosures, where this is a material financial risk and/or opportunity for them,"" Boss wrote. ""But it also reinforced our long-held view that that the pathway to decarbonization is difficult to predict and will not occur in a straight line. Consistent with that view, we have not supported certain climate shareholder proposals that are overly prescriptive or micro-manage how companies should decarbonize.""

The report argues falling support for environmental and social proposals from shareholders last year was not unique to BlackRock, with support for such proposals at all U.S. public companies dropped from 36 percent to 27 percent over the proxy season.

BlackRock said the decline suggested that ""most investors took a measured, materiality-based approach in their analysis and voting on proposals this proxy year.""

When assessing shareholder proposals, we evaluate each proposal on its merit, with a singular focus on its implications for long-term value creation.

It cites examples of overly prescriptive proposals as those that called for decommissioning fossil fuel assets, the elimination of financing and insurance underwriting for fossil fuel projects, and cessation of fossil fuel exploration and development.

""When assessing shareholder proposals, we evaluate each proposal on its merit, with a singular focus on its implications for long-term value creation,"" the report states. ""We consider the business and economic relevance of the issue raised, as well as its materiality and the urgency with which we believe it should be addressed.""

BlackRock first warned several months ago that its 2022 climate-related shareholder proposals had become more prescriptive compared to the previous year, in the wake of new guidance from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that broadened the scope of permissible proposals that address shareholder social policy issues. The note acknowledged there were ""unique dynamics"" at play during this year's season, arguing that Russia's invasion of Ukraine had made investments in companies that invest in both fossil fuel and renewable energy sources of energy more attractive.

It also claimed to have seen a growing trend whereby companies, particularly in Europe, were increasingly choosing to introduce management proposals on climate action plans and progress, alongside those introduced by shareholders. In these instances, Blackrock said it and other investors were ""increasingly inclined to support the management proposal.""

The firm's increasingly vocal stance on climate has faced criticism amid claims it is at odds with its actual investment activity.

BlackRock has become increasingly vocal about environmental sustainability in recent years, with CEO Larry Fink using his annual letter to shareholders and CEOs to make the economic case for the net zero transition, and also to tout the firm's latest coal exclusion policies, as well as other measures aimed at slashing emissions from the firm's giant asset portfolio.

But the firm's increasingly vocal stance on climate has faced criticism amid claims it is at odds with its actual investment activity, given BlackRock remains one of the world's largest investors in both fossil fuel companies and businesses linked to deforestation.

A report published last year calculated that BlackRock holds $85 billion in coal companies, and in January 2021 the company completed a $15 billion deal with Saudi Aramco to acquire 49 percent of its gas pipeline subsidiary.",'Less supportable': BlackRock holds back approval of US shareholder climate proposals

At last year’s climate summit in Glasgow, there was much fanfare surrounding GFANZ (the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero). Founded a few months prior, it committed hundreds of financial institutions to become carbon neutral by 2050.

But on finance day at COP27, Global Witness exposed the poor progress of asset firms which have failed to stop investing in forest-felling commodities.

“A year on from COP26, GFANZ membership is at risk of becoming little more than a badge to be worn by banks and financiers, who continue to plough money into practices that are destroying our forests,” says Veronica Oakeshott, forests campaign leader at the NGO.

COP27 is clamping down on empty net zero pledges

The revelation comes amid a high level crackdown on hollow net zero pledges.

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres presided over the launch of a UN ‘how to guide’ to root out greenwashing in emissions promises yesterday, with fierce words for “fossil fuel companies and their financial enablers.”

“[He] has quite rightly lost patience with greenwashing companies that sign up to net zero but carry on with the same destructive practices as before,” Oakeshott adds.

“Our research shows this is not only a problem with regard to fossil fuel investments but also exposure to deforestation risk. It is not surprising that Mr Guterres, and his group of advisers, are increasingly looking to legislation to hold companies to account.”

GFANZ dropped out of the ‘Race to Net Zero’

The alliance created a buzz at COP26, led by former Bank of England governor Mark Carney who claimed it could “unlock the $1 trillion of additional annual investment needed for the net zero transition in emerging markets and developing countries by the middle of this decade.”

But climate campaigners were quick to express their scepticism. Greta Thunberg was among those denouncing GFANZ as ‘greenwash’, as it allowed institutions to keep investing in fossil fuels while buying carbon offsets.

In its defence, GFANZ said it would form its plans using ""the most rigorous science-based scenarios"".

However, in September Carney had to write to members urging them to stop financing deforestation, warning, “the world will not reach net zero by 2050 unless we halt and reverse deforestation within a decade”.

And in October the alliance announced it was dropping out of the ‘Race to Net Zero’ after the UN-backed campaign upped its standards and threatened to kick out non-performers.

""The recent decision by GFANZ to walk away from Race to Zero and its independently-set targets, including ambitious pledges on deforestation, right at the moment that members might be chucked out for not meeting them, tells you everything you need to know about member intentions,” says Oakeshott.

Which financial institutions are still tied to deforestation?

Since COP26, there has only been a three per cent reduction by GFANZ members in investments at risk of contributing to the clearing of the world's climate-critical forests, the analysis shows.

360 asset managers participating in the alliance continue to hold such investments worth a combined $8.5 billion (€8.47 bn) - almost matching the $9 billion (€8.97 bn) sum President Biden pledged to fight deforestation last year.

Financial giants BlackRock, Vanguard and Deutsche Bank are among those continuing business as usual, says Global Witness. They have continued to invest in agri-business companies that stand accused of mass-scale deforestation such as the Brazilian meatpacker JBS.

In fact, Global Witness finds some members have acquired an additional 10 million shares in JBS since COP26, with Vanguard alone increasing investments in JBS by an estimated €12.4 million.

Tougher laws are needed to hold investors to account

Not all in the financial sector are shirking their responsibility.

On Tuesday, nine financial institutions, managing a combined €175 billion in assets, wrote to the European Commission and Council, asking for the financial sector to be included in the EU’s anti-deforestation law.

Triodos Bank, ASN Bank and Merkur were among the signatories acknowledging that “despite voluntary commitments and policies to tackle deforestation, financial institutions are continuing to provide investments linked to deforestation practices.”

They are trying to bring the Commission round to the Parliament’s position - that the final text for the new Deforestation Regulation to ensure EU products aren’t denuding forests should cover financial institutions too.

If we want any forests left standing, and to have any prospect of avoiding catastrophic climate change, governments must introduce legislation that stops investors contributing to the destruction of rainforests. Veronica Oakeshott Forests campaign leader, Global Witness

Global Witness is also calling on governments in key financial centres to introduce legislation requiring investors to ensure their portfolios are not contributing to rainforest destruction.

“If we want any forests left standing, and to have any prospect of avoiding catastrophic climate change, governments must introduce legislation that stops investors contributing to the destruction of rainforests,” adds Oakeshott.","BlackRock, Vanguard and Deutsche Bank among firms still financing deforestation, new report shows"

The initial facility will be used to recapitalise, refinance and fund the construction of New Green Power’s original portfolio of 82MW construction and operational stage solar assets in Taiwan. The portfolio is owned by Global Renewable Power Fund III, a private fund managed by BlackRock Alternatives’ Climate Infrastructure business through its wholly owned subsidiary New Green Power. It aggregates over 100 projects and sub-projects held by a number of operating companies, spanning ground-mounted, floating and rooftop technologies.



This financing builds on the earlier financing of a portfolio of operational solar assets in Taiwan under BlackRock Alternatives’ Climate Infrastructure business which closed in April 2022, and includes a number of further innovative first-in-market features including:

a significant accordion feature which can be used to acquire and fund future projects;

the ability to adjust the pool of assets in the financed portfolio within agreed parameters, allowing the platform to be built out over time; and

flexibility to leverage the platform to conduct early stage development of projects.





The lenders comprised two Taiwanese banks, Bank SinoPac and E.Sun Commercial Bank, and three international banks, BNP Paribas, Credit Agricole CIB and Standard Chartered Bank.

At a high level, BlackRock's view is that ""well-managed companies will effectively evaluate and manage material sustainability related risks and opportunities relevant to their businesses,"" which in turn requires ""appropriate oversight of sustainability considerations."" Relatedly, what it terms ""robust disclosure"" is ""essential for investors to effectively evaluate companies' strategy and business practices related to material sustainability-related risks and opportunities."" As a result, BlackRock encourages companies to make disclosure consistent with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework and, acknowledging the lack of uniform reporting standards and data sources, it encourages companies to make use of industry-specific standards such as ""those identified by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), now part of the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) under the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) Foundation.""

Highlighting the connection between governance and disclosure, BlackRock points out that ""the four pillars"" of the disclosure-oriented TCFD, namely ""governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets,"" also provide ""a useful way for companies to disclose how they identify, assess, manage, and oversee a variety of sustainability-related risks and opportunities."" Emphasizing the governance point, BlackRock adds that it ""encourages companies to include in their disclosure a business plan for how they intend to deliver long-term financial performance through a transition to global net zero carbon emissions, consistent with their business model and sector."" Taking note of the increasing prominence of biodiversity concerns, BlackRock also ""encourages companies to consider reporting on nature-related factors, given the growing materiality of these issues for many businesses."" BlackRock acknowledges the difficulties involved in measuring Scope 3 emissions, which it views ""differently from Scopes 1 and 2, given methodological complexity, regulatory uncertainty, concerns about double-counting, and lack of direct control by companies."" As a result, it will take any Scope 3 disclosures to represent a good faith attempt to provide supply chain emission information while recognizing the significant limitations on the accuracy or thoroughness of any such reporting. On the other hand, BlackRock is ""unlikely"" to support disclosures that do not provide science-based short-, medium-, and long-term Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions targets.

Taking the Temperature: Despite continued pushback from state and federal Republican lawmakers on what they describe as ""wokeism,"" BlackRock and other asset managers continue to encourage active governance regarding, and disclosure on, material sustainability-related risks and opportunities. The other members of the ""Big 3,"" Vanguard and State Street, have not yet published 2023 stewardship principles. BlackRock's position aligns with the view that sustainability concerns present material risks and opportunities that companies need to manage from a governance perspective and, relatedly, report on to investors. Like all asset managers, BlackRock's fiduciary duties require consideration of these and other material considerations impacting the companies in which they invest. Notwithstanding efforts on the part of certain state government officials to politicize ESG issues, the ""hype"" around an anti-ESG backlash ultimately may amount to no more than that. BlackRock and other asset managers no doubt will continue to have to contend with investigations and potential loss of some state government business as a result of their ESG positions (whether or not those positions are correctly characterized, and notwithstanding, for instance, their continued investments in the fossil fuel industry). But speaking from the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in Davos on January 17, BlackRock's CEO Laurence Fink said that the firm actually took in $230 billion in 2022 from clients, while losing approximately $4 billion AUM as a result of state government reaction to ESG issues. Those results could be read as evidence that the market agrees with BlackRock and others on the need to responsibly consider climate risks when making investment decisions.

BlackRock Real Assets will acquire SolarZero for an undisclosed amount, but has committed to spending more than $NZ100 million over the next three years to accelerate the growth of SolarZero’s solar and battery technology platform.

SolarZero started out as a solar thermal company in the 1970s, and its present incarnation was established in 2008, since when has built itself up to become a leading provider of rooftop solar and smart battery storage systems across New Zealand’s residential, commercial, and community buildings.

It bills itself as a “solar-as-a-service” option, and offers a fixed monthly solar services fee and no upfront installation costs.

“Kiwis want clean and resilient energy,” said Andrew Booth, the CEO and founder of SolarZero.

“BlackRock Climate Infrastructure team’s investment and backing will enable us to rapidly increase our scale, grow our energy services network, and accelerate the transition to a 100% clean energy future.

“By 2030, 50% of the world’s energy will be generated in the Asia Pacific region. The window to prevent the worst impacts of the climate crisis is closing fast, and the power couple of solar plus storage is one of the few true paths to energy security, stable power prices, and a livable planet.

New Zealand has set a target of reaching 100% renewable electricity generation by 2035 and to become a carbon neutral economy by 2050.

However, solar penetration currently sits at only 2%, and with demand for electricity in New Zealand expected to double by the middle of the century, there exists a clear need for much more residential solar.

“New Zealand is widely recognised as a global leader in renewable energy and climate finance, and we are pleased to make our first investment in this market,” said Charlie Reid, Asia-Pacific co-head of climate infrastructure for BlackRock.

“Our move into New Zealand demonstrates BlackRock’s commitment to invest in attractive markets as part of our broader efforts to offer a flow of addressable global climate investment opportunities for our clients.

Last month, BlackRock announced the purchase of Melbourne-based Akaysha Energy, and said it would commit to $1 billion of spending for new battery storage projects over coming years.",BlackRock adds to clean energy portfolio with NZ solar and battery storage company

The article, titled ""What’s Worse: Climate Denial or Climate Hypocrisy?"", contends that many companies that pledged to invest in more climate friendly initiatives have not fulfilled their promises.

""The era of climate denial has been replaced with one plagued by climate promises that no one seems prepared to keep,"" he wrote.

Wallace-Wells pointed to an annual letter published by BlackRock CEO Larry Fink as evidence for his claim. He noted that Fink ""called global warming the most serious threat to the financial system in his 40 years of experience and promised a drastic response from his firm.""

Wallace-Wells wrote that Fink’s promises included ""making sustainability ‘integral to portfolio construction and risk management’, ditching investments that contribute to the problem; and pursuing not just sustainability but transparency, too, so we all could see what impacts the company was having.""

He asserted that "" finance seemed to take the hint , creating a new wave of purportedly virtuous ‘environmental, social and governance’ (E.S.G.) investing.""

Despite these promises, Fink has recently struck a radically different tone, according to Wallace-Wells.

""But in his annual letter this January, just two years later, Fink struck a radically different tone, rejecting ‘woke’ capitalism and elevating the principle that investors should center only on profits,"" he wrote. ""In the spring, the firm announced it would support fewer shareholder resolutions on climate change, ‘as we do not consider them to be consistent with our clients’ long-term financial interests.’ Just months before, BlackRock closed a $15.5 billion investment in Saudi pipelines.""

""What should we call an about-face like this? The word that comes most easily to mind is ‘hypocrisy’ — or perhaps ‘greenwashing,’ the insult that activists like to lob at companies that use eco-friendly rhetoric to launder their reputations,"" he added. ""This basic phenomenon, in which powerful people make climate pledges that turn out to wildly outrace their genuine commitments, has now become so pervasive that it begins to look less like venality by any one person or institution and more like a new political grammar.""

Critics of ESG argue that it is a mechanism used by the government and private sector to force a transition away from oil and fossil fuels, as well as pushing diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives at the expense of fiduciary duty.

Fox News host Laura Ingraham blasted companies that utilize ESG.

""Environmental, social, governance. The acronym ESG is a classification and rating system that globalists are now using to pressure American companies into adopting progressive practices at every level of their operations. And like so many really bad ideas, it, of course, originated at the United Nations,"" Ingraham said. ""Now for years, they've aggressively marketed the concept as good for companies, good for you and good for the planet. ESG propaganda even comes in the form of really creepy videos.""

Environmental social and governance criteria, a.k.a. ESG, ""creates a giant societal placebo where we think that we’re making progress even though we’re not,"" says my former BlackRock colleague Tariq Fancy.

That is a bold claim about one of the hottest buzzwords in sustainable investing, but Fancy knows what he’s talking about: He was recruited by the world’s largest asset manager in late 2017 to be its first chief investment officer for sustainable investing — Wall Street’s answer to society’s growing demands for action on climate change and other social issues. It was also at a moment of time when BlackRock was about to begin dramatically expanding its focus on environmental social and governance criteria, a.k.a. ESG, which CEO Larry Fink has described as the greatest investment opportunity ever. Fink also has championed that free markets, not systematic government action, are the route to resolving the climate crisis.

Fancy is pushing back, arguing systematic government oversight is the only way to scalable climate solutions. BlackRock, Fancy says, is a ""microcosm"" of capitalism itself, and why its approach to climate action threatens climate progress. These are some excerpts from our talk.

Peter McKillop: You seem to be on an anti-ESG mission. Is that accurate?

Tariq Fancy: I’m pro-environmental and social progress, of course. That’s why I joined BlackRock, having left the industry years earlier to found Rumie, an education technology nonprofit I now run. I was attracted by the promise of using my investing background to help ""green"" Wall Street and address the urgent climate crisis. But while some of the ESG movement, including various tools and standards, are steps in the right direction, they’re currently not being used correctly. And so we are at a moment in history when skepticism on ESG products is extraordinary. Journalists, fund managers, everyone is quietly talking about it. The major problem that I have is that even if they’re marketed correctly, they actually have no demonstrable impact.

The major problem that I have is that even if they’re marketed correctly, they actually have no demonstrable impact.

McKillop: ""No demonstrable impact"" is a pretty big problem. How did you reach this conclusion?

Fancy: While leading the charge to incorporate environmental, social and governance considerations into all of our $8.7 trillion of investment activities at BlackRock, I started realizing that there’s not a lot of value at all in this data. It didn’t — and it does not — work in most [investment] strategies, since many are short-term and don’t care about long-term issues, and also because, frankly, acting irresponsibly is often profitable. I realized this data was not at all useful to invest in, or at least not nearly as much as [Fink] was implying. It was mainly marketing.

Worse, I also started to realize that all the stuff on ""stakeholder"" capitalism was hollow marketing — it seemed almost intended to dupe the public into believing that we don’t need the overdue government regulation that we need immediately to address the climate crisis.

McKillop: One concern you mentioned is that ESG performance incentives are not aligned to short-term business goals.

Fancy: Yes. I looked at CEO tenure: It is the shortest it has been in decades. CEO pay is the highest it has been in decades. That was worrying. The system works according to incentives and self-interest. And if their incentives and self-interest are on the next five years, and there’s a problem whose impacts may become more acute 20 and 30 years away, then it’s unlikely they’ll act quickly enough or aggressively enough to address what is clearly in the long-term public interest.

McKillop: So what is an alternative to ESG?

Fancy: ESG as a measurement standard has value. But using vague ESG information alone as a mechanism of change is disastrous. It doesn’t work and creates a giant societal placebo where we think that we’re making progress even though we’re not. As the old saying goes, what isn’t measured isn’t managed. Measurement is not enough. That data needs to be managed in a way that changes the underlying incentives of the system, correcting the market failure that is at the heart of our climate crisis. That has to be a systematic solution and can only come from government leadership.

For climate, you need real regulation. If you don’t want Goldman Sachs to finance something, just make it illegal. Or far less profitable. But don’t ask them nicely or rely on them to suddenly be ethical. That’s not how the system works, and we’ve seen time and time again that relying on Wall Street and big business to ""self-regulate"" is a recipe for disaster.

Experts have said for decades that we needed systemic solutions at the government policy level to address the climate crisis. That has to begin with a price on carbon. It is the only way to get the entire market to react.

McKillop: Aren’t a lot of fund managers starting to think about divestment?

Fancy: Divestment never made sense. I always found it odd that people go one by one, and they say, ""Hey, we’ll divest from you. We’ll pressure J.P. Morgan to stop lending."" It’s like playing whack-a-mole. There are 10,000 more holes, and you’re just hitting them all day.

McKillop: Yes, you’ve said that strategies like divestment are a distraction from the needed focus on systemic solutions to the climate crisis.

Fancy: Imagine if, in the 1960s, Martin Luther King Jr. decided to fight his fight for human rights through asking people to use their 401Ks to divest of companies that discriminated against Black people. It would have done nothing and been pretty ridiculous given the urgency and importance of the issue. Instead, he said these companies are based in our country, and we’re a democracy, so we can change the laws and compel them to do what is just and in the public interest. And they marched on Washington to demand that the government use its powers to ensure that human rights are respected across the country and enforced by law.

Systemic problems require systemic solutions led by democratically elected leaders. Truly averting the climate threat requires governments and the private sector to come together to rapidly transform our economy into one that doesn’t have to be bad for business, but can no longer be business as usual. But that leadership must come from the leaders we elect, not the businesses whose leaders we don’t elect and whose incentives today do not align with the long-term public interest.

McKillop: Are we using different standards for judging and acting on climate risk compared to the COVID-19 risk?

Fancy: COVID-19 is a global systemic risk, and we were able to use extraordinary government measures such as restricting travel, making masks mandatory, and closing high-risk venues. You couldn’t leave it to the free market and let everyone do what they wanted to do, otherwise countries like the U.S. would have lost millions of people unnecessarily.

With climate, we’ve not seen any aggressive action from governments. And that’s why we’re in a position where the current estimates are we’re going to increase emissions by 7.5 percent in a decade when we need to drop by 2 percent. I feel like the fact that we’re dragging our feet on climate has less to do with the nature and magnitude of the threat and more to do with the incubation period: COVID-19 takes weeks; climate change takes decades. Are current leaders incentivized to care about the long-term?

McKillop: And this is where you disagree with your old boss, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink?

Fancy: I heard Larry say the free markets will correct it, and I was like, hold on a second here.

Larry understands the need for government action to bend down a curve on COVID. He’s fine when the incubation period is a few weeks or months, but when it comes to a crisis like climate — which is far worse — and will take decades [to manage], then it’s like, ""Oh, well actually, let’s leave it to the free market."" Which translates into ""leave stuff the way it is and hope the market figures out what we’ve known for a long time"" is the greatest market failure in history.

That, to me, is highly irresponsible.

McKillop: When did you first become skeptical about BlackRock’s ESG push?

Fancy: I had to figure out an investment mechanism for how to create social change because Larry was writing that in letters and I kept getting asked by clients, ""How does this actually lower emissions?"" So I started writing a long paper to explain how ESG and sustainable investing will, over the long term, actually start to transform capitalism into better outcomes. By the time I had finished, I realized I had just written a somewhat tortured argument that the free market will slowly correct itself. And I said, “""Oh my God, we’ve known for decades that climate change is the greatest market failure in history.""

I could clearly see that the markets would not ""correct"" themselves without government action. At some point we have to accept that burning fossil fuels is dangerous to us unless we do something.",BlackRock’s former head of sustainable investing says ESG and sustainability investing are distractions

Gardaí were called to the Dublin offices of the world’s largest investment management firm, BlackRock, after climate activists glued themselves to the main entrance.

Access through the revolving front door of the Ballsbridge building was blocked for several hours as a result of the action on Monday.

Two dozen activists from Extinction Rebellion Ireland arrived at the offices at midday with banners calling on BlackRock to stop investing in fossil fuels.

They glued posters to the windows stating facts about climate change and poured fake black oil on the ground outside.

Gardaí warned the group that those who glued themselves or the posters to the property would be investigated for criminal damage.

Eight gardaí and several patrol vehicles maintained a visible presence at the premises.

Sineaid Whelan (19), a politics and Spanish student, was one of those glued to the door.

“We have been preparing for this for a couple of months and it definitely wasn’t a whim decision,” she said.

“It’s something that has to be done at this point – the climate crisis means we have to do it.”

Fellow student, Pasha Fedjukoves (22), who also glued his hand to the door said the actions of companies like BlackRock was unacceptable.

“It’s outrageous and we can’t let them get away with it,” he said.

“It's very important, especially for younger people to start doing this kind of stuff because realistically it’s our world that they’re destroying. We need to fight to keep it.”

The pair remained glued for several hours before voluntarily allowing fellow protestors to remove the solvent.

Extinction Rebellion Ireland said the action would be the start of a planned series of demonstrations against fossil fuel investors.

Spokesman Manuel Salazar said companies were making huge profits from prolonging fossil fuel use at the expense of the planet.

“Every tenth of a degree of warming matters in this climate crisis,” he said.

“We are in a critical time window now where we must urgently act to avoid a level of warming that lead to the worst case scenarios of climate catastrophe and we can’t just stand by and allow giant, wealthy corporations like BlackRock to jeopardise our chances.”

Contacted for comment, a BlackRock spokesperson said that the money it managed belonged to clients, not the company.

“BlackRock’s role in the transition to a low-carbon economy is as a fiduciary,” the spokesperson said.

""We provide choice to our clients, we seek the best risk-adjusted returns within the mandate our clients give us.”

The company also referenced a letter from its chief executive Larry Fink on the subject in which he said that divesting from carbon-intensive assets would simply push them out of the public market into the private market and “will not get the world to net zero”.

The light installations are designed by Finnish artists, Pekka Niittyvirta and Timo Aho.

Línte na Farraige is a recipient of the inaugural Creative Climate Action fund, an initiative from the Creative Ireland Programme, in collaboration with the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications that supports creative, cultural and artistic projects that build awareness around climate change and empower citizens to make meaningful behavioural transformations.

The art installation at the Martello Tower in Blackrock Park, consisting of a solar powered horizontal LED line of light, shows the future risks of rising seas and storm surges, in the year 2100 and under a high-risk scenario where ice loss from Antarctica is greater than expected. The installation is based on future predictions from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Report AR6, and historic storm surge data in Dublin Bay. Find out more at www.lintenafarraige.com

The installation demonstrates the need to collectively reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and adapt together to protect our coastlines and communities, from the effects of climate change. This public installation will run at the Martello Tower for a number of months. The Council is also running an associated outdoor, public exhibition on the Línte na Farraige project at Moran Park, dlr LexIcon, Dún Laoghaire.

Speaking of the Línte na Farraige project, Councillor Mary Hanafin, An Cathaoirleach, said: ‘The Línte na Farraige project, is a unique, yet stark reminder, that our seas are silently rising, and will continue to do so, undetectable to the naked eye. The Government’s national Climate Action Plan 2023 speaks to ambition that will only work if we all come together in a strengthened ‘social contract’ for climate action, working towards real solutions that are meaningful, inclusive, fair and accessible. By working together, we can all help ‘lower the line’. I wish to thank the Artists, the National Monuments Service, the Creative Climate Action programme and the wider project team, for bringing this installation to Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council’.

Frank Curran, Chief Executive of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council said: ‘I am delighted that the Council is a local authority partner in the Línte na Farraige project. Climate action is central to the broad range of services that we provide to our customers, including social housing upgrades, active travel, environmental awareness programmes and our numerous strategic plans and policies. I believe that as we all work towards our 2030 and 2050 climate action targets, local authorities can be at the heart of this ambition, given our close links with local communities, our role in emergency response planning and our ongoing partnership with various Government departments and agencies’.

The project artists Pekka Niittyvirta and Timo Aho said: ‘We believe that the topic we are talking about here, is one of the most important challenges we are facing. Art has the potential to convey scientific data, complex ideas and concepts, in a powerful way that words or graphs fall short of. Visualising something that is incomprehensible for a human, even with the factual studies and data available when talking about causality and climate change, is difficult. We seem to be unable to accept things we have not physically experienced’.

Catherine Martin T.D. Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media said: ‘I welcome the timely unveiling of the Línte na Farraige installation in Blackrock Park. I hope that it will generate a much-needed dialogue about rising sea levels. While it should give us all pause for thought, it must be remembered that the future is still in our hands. By making key changes in our personal behaviour we can mitigate against climate change and sea level rise and build a more sustainable and resilient future for us all’.

Línte na Farraige is a collaborative project, with a team including Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, scientists based at Trinity College Dublin, Maynooth University, University College Cork, the Dublin Climate Action Regional Office, Wexford County Council, Galway City Council, Fingal County Council, the Marine Institute, Irish creators and artists.

And its clients want clear action toward a net-zero goal in place as soon as the end of this decade.

BlackRock BLK, +0.92% said Thursday that by 2030, it anticipates at least 75% of its corporate and sovereign assets managed on behalf of clients will be invested in stock and bond issuers with science-based emissions targets. That would be up from 25% currently.

The U.S. and most powerful economies have aimed to halve their total emissions by 2030 and reach net-zero by no later than 2050.

Climate groups said because an expanded pledge comes from the world’s largest institutional investor, it could influence others and combine to make an instrumental reduction in global emissions, but only if reality matches the pledge.

“Because an orderly transition to net zero by 2050 would benefit the global economy and our clients in aggregate, we believe that by 2030, all issuers would benefit from developing and implementing robust transition plans,” BlackRock said in its release.

But BlackRock made clear again that an energy transition may have to include oil BRN00, +0.17% and gas.

“The Russian invasion of Ukraine is a stark reminder of the challenges of a just and orderly energy transition,” the company said. “These events may drive short-term increases in demand for fossil fuels and associated emissions in some regions, while potentially accelerating investments into renewable energy in Europe and other regions where energy security goals are aligned with decarbonization.”

Emissions, including carbon and the more-potent, but shorter-lasting methane, are driving the average global temperature higher, raising sea levels and intensifying droughts, floods and severe weather, costing lives and billions in economic loss.

A voluntary pledge set in Paris in 2015 and since reinforced aims to hold global warming to no more than 2 degrees Celsius. Ideally, the rise is no greater than 1.5 degrees. Recent U.N. climate panel reports have chided a too-slow response to reach that goal.

Why BlackRock matters

“‘The climate crisis is a financial risk that will continue to affect valuations.’” — Mindy Lubber of Ceres

As damages from climate-related weather disasters grew to $145 billion in the U.S. alone last year and as the International Energy Agency, the typically industry-friendly watchdog, warns of the need to cease development of fossil fuel assets, the investment and business community have come to discern that climate risk is financial risk. BlackRock’s CEO Larry Fink famously said as much two years ago in a letter that upended how financial markets viewed climate change.

“When the largest asset manager in the world ups its goal from 25% of such assets invested in science-based-target issuers to 75% of those assets, others should take note. The climate crisis is a financial risk that will continue to affect valuations,” said Mindy Lubber, CEO and president of sustainable-investing advocate Ceres.

About 90% of companies in the S&P 500 SPX, +0.14% publish voluntary reports disclosing carbon emissions to some degree as well as renewable-energy use. The Securities and Exchange Commission is taking steps toward formalizing the requirements around reporting climate risk and pushing for a uniform way to report this information.

What about oil and gas?

Other environmental groups said Thursday the impact of the BlackRock target depends on whether the asset manager implements guidelines to ensure that the heavy emitters in its portfolio, including oil CL00, -1.89% and gas companies, large shipping interests and others, are covered by its goal.

Testament to the asset manager’s influence, one such watchdog is explicitly named BlackRock’s Big Problem Campaign.

Casey Harrell, the group’s senior strategist, said “BlackRock issued an aspirational goal that it has confidence it can achieve. This goal is big enough that it could have the global impact needed. BlackRock must include specific targets and emission reduction goals for heavy-polluting sectors.”

“It must use every tool in its toolbelt to achieve these results, including engagement, voting, investment policy and fund capital allocation,” Harrell added.

BlackRock, for instance, still has some exposure to the global coal sector. Coal use, which has been replaced in many uses with natural gas NG00, +7.85% , remains the “dirtiest” emitter among fossil fuels.

“BlackRock must act with urgency, especially with respect to the fossil fuel expansionists in [its] portfolio that are leading us to climate catastrophe,” said Lara Cuvelier, sustainable investment manager with advocacy Reclaim Finance. “After all, BlackRock today holds $34 billion in companies planning to expand their coal business, such as Glencore GLEN, -0.55% . ”

“‘[BlackRock] must use every tool in its toolbelt to achieve these results, including engagement, voting, investment policy and fund capital allocation.’” — Casey Harrell, of BlackRock’s Big Problem Campaign

BlackRock, along with Vanguard Group, Allianz Global Investors and Brookfield Asset Management and others, have formed the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, which pledged to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions by 2050.

Last November, think tank Universal Owner, said the firms in the initiative held portfolios that put them on track to cut their CO2 footprint by just 20% this decade. That’s below the 50% cut identified by scientists as critical to reaching a mid-century goal of full carbon neutrality.

In his annual letter to CEOs , Fink said businesses, cities and countries that do not plan for a carbon-free future risked being left behind. He argued that the pursuit of long-term returns was the main driver behind climate policies, after being criticised for seeking to influence companies.

“Stakeholder capitalism is not about politics. It is not a social or ideological agenda. It is not ‘woke’,” he wrote. “We focus on sustainability not because we’re environmentalists, but because we are capitalists and fiduciaries to our clients.”

West Virginia’s treasurer said this week that the state’s Treasury investment board would no longer use a BlackRock fund, after the fund manager urged companies to cut their carbon emissions to net zero by 2050. The official said this would damage West Virginia’s economy.

In his Dear CEO letter, Fink wrote: “It is through effective stakeholder capitalism that capital is efficiently allocated, companies achieve durable profitability, and value is created and sustained over the long term. Make no mistake, the fair pursuit of profit is still what animates markets; and long-term profitability is the measure by which markets will ultimately determine your company’s success.”

After Fink wrote two years ago that climate risk was an investment risk and that the firm would put sustainability at the heart of its investment decisions, many companies set out plans to become carbon-neutral. BlackRock had previously been criticised for not pushing hard enough on the issue.

Last spring, BlackRock – which manages about $10tn (£7.4tn) in assets – reportedly threw its weight behind a shareholder campaign to oust several directors on the board of the US oil giant ExxonMobil. The coup launched by dissident hedge fund activists at Engine No 1 replaced two Exxon board members with its own candidates to help push the oil company towards a greener strategy.

Fink predicted in this year’s letter that “the next 1,000 unicorns won’t be search engines or social media companies, they’ll be sustainable, scalable innovators – startups that help the world decarbonise and make the energy transition affordable for all consumers”, adding that established companies should strive to do the same.

He said a “tectonic shift” had happened in recent years, with sustainable investments globally reaching $4tn.

Fink also said that companies had a moral responsibility to adapt to “a new world of work” that had been reshaped by the coronavirus pandemic. He said “that world is gone” – where companies expected workers to come to the office five days a week, mental health was rarely discussed in the workplace, and wages for those on low and middle incomes barely grew.","BlackRock’s Larry Fink: climate policies are about profits, not being ‘woke’"

Larry Fink has urged businesses to prepare for a carbon-free future and said BlackRock, which manages more than $10tn in assets, would put sustainability at the heart of its investment decisions.

However, in an email sent after meeting BlackRock executives last month, the chairman of Texas’s oil and gas regulator wrote: “It was nice to hear that BlackRock didn’t mean – or no longer believes – many of the disagreeable things the company and its CEO Mr Fink have said about the oil and gas industry.”

The email was uncovered via freedom of information requests sent by the Bureau and the thinktank InfluenceMap.

BlackRock joins several major banks – including Barclays, Citigroup and Wells Fargo – that have quietly downplayed their environmental commitments so they can keep doing business with deep-pocketed US states.

In November, 15 US states – responsible for more than $600bn in funds – wrote an open letter to the banking industry in which they threatened to withdraw their business from financial institutions that boycott fossil fuel companies.

Texas has already passed a law to that effect and other states are preparing similar legislation, setting the stage for a showdown with banks and asset managers that have pledged to wind down their financing of fossil fuels.

Due to pressure from some investors, most banks have policies in place to limit the business they do with coal-fired power, one of the dirtiest forms of energy generation.

Summary Companies Exxon proxy vote to test BlackRock on ESG aims

Asset firm held talks with Exxon twice as often as BP, Chevron















HOUSTON/BOSTON, May 19 (Reuters) - Top asset manager BlackRock (BLK.N) could determine the outcome of a proxy fight between Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) and a hedge fund seeking to reshape the oil giant's board and future direction.

Exxon's 12 directors are up for election on May 26, in a vote that offers a high profile test of BlackRock's approach to getting companies to set a course to limit global warming to below 2 degrees Celsius by 2050. Exxon stresses it is on a path to meet the Paris accord with a market-based approach.

Forced board changes or splitting chairman and CEO roles would be a blow to the company's management. Unlike rivals that predict peak demand within a decade, Exxon's board has built plans that forecast growing appetite for oil and gas.

BlackRock this year has vowed to hold corporate directors' feet to the fire on environmental matters and has done so for instance by voting against a director on another high-profile corporate ballot.

Its votes could help hedge fund Engine No.1 gain seats on the board. The fund says Exxon continues to overspend on fossil fuels and lacks a clear strategy to prepare for a world demanding cleaner fuels. The May 26 vote has become the first major shareholder contest where climate change is the central issue.

BACKING ESG PROPOSALS

BlackRock declined to comment on its stance on Exxon. It is the second-largest Exxon shareholder with an about 6.6% stake, and has met with Exxon executives twice as often as Chevron (CVX.N) and BP (BP.L), according to its disclosures. Smaller investors have publicly supported Engine No.1's directors.

The $9 trillion asset manager's chief executive, Larry Fink, in January in his annual letter to CEOs asked for companies to lay out a strategy to operate in a net-zero economy.

In the first quarter, it backed three-quarters of environment and social-focused shareholder resolutions, compared with less than 10% a year ago. read more

Some activists say BlackRock's voting to date has not fully met their expectations. But it has issued greater details about its voting practices, offering insight into what corporations should expect.

A recent disclosure showed BlackRock voted against a director at Woodside Petroleum Ltd (WPL.AX) last month to express concerns with Woodside's climate targets. Woodside declined to comment.

BlackRock also voted last year against two Exxon directors, citing a lack of progress in climate reporting. In both cases, directors were re-elected though Exxon ultimately released more greenhouse gas emissions data.

'CONSTRUCTIVE' TALKS

Some Exxon holders said the pressure is on BlackRock to uphold its tougher goals in voting Exxon shares this year. Governance advisers ISS, Glass, Lewis & Co and PIRC have recommended votes for some or all the dissident nominees for Exxon. read more

""Investors who understand the importance of overhauling Exxon's board of directors know that major investors, like BlackRock and others, can push our efforts over the top,"" said New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli. New York's pension funds have backed the call by Engine No.1 for change at Exxon.

Church Commissioners for England, which manages the Church of England's investment fund, expects large asset managers ""to vote for the entire dissident slate in line with their stated climate and sustainability goals,"" said Bess Joffe, head of responsible investment.

Exxon's talks with investors overall have been constructive, said spokesman Casey Norton. ""We value their views and welcome input,"" he said.

Exxon's lack of a target for restricting customers emissions makes it likely BlackRock would not support its director slate, said Kathryn Mulvey, a campaign director at climate activists Union of Concerned Scientists. Engine No.1 ""explicitly calls out"" Exxon for failing to set so-called Scope 3, or customer emissions targets, she said.

However, Exxon has embraced measures to meet BlackRock's and other investors' climate and governance goals, including expanding its board, pledging to increase spending on lower-carbon initiatives, and reducing the intensity of its oilfield greenhouse gas emissions.

Summary Companies Range to meet EU's Climate Transition Benchmark

Six funds currently manage more than $9 bln

Changes to reassure investors over divergence from parent index















LONDON, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Asset manager BlackRock (BLK.N) said on Tuesday it had created the largest range of climate-aligned exchange-traded equity funds (EFT) after agreeing to tighter rules to govern six existing funds with $9 billion in assets.

Following consultations with BlackRock, the MSCI indexes that underpin BlackRock's iShares ESG Enhanced UCITS ETF range will follow the European Union's Climate Transition Benchmark, established to help cap global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7°Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial norms.

The CTB requires a 30% reduction in carbon intensity - a measure of emissions to revenue - against the MSCI benchmark and a 7% year-on-year decarbonisation of the benchmark itself.

For the first time, Scope 3 emissions that cover the emissions produced by the use of a company's products, and not just those produced by the company itself, will be included.

In addition to the CTB, BlackRock said tougher environmental filters would be applied when deciding what to include in the ETFs. It will widen an oil sands exclusion to include a broader array of unconventional oil and gas activities.

The funds will exclude any company making 5% or more of its revenues from oil sands, shale gas, shale oil, coal-seam gas, coal-bed methane and Arctic onshore/offshore reserves.

An ""environmental harm"" screen will also be applied from November 2022 to companies that have faced severe or very severe controversies relating to environmental issues, such as land use and biodiversity, toxic spills and water management, it said.

Unlike BlackRock's iShares MSCI World Paris-Aligned Climate UCITS ETF fund range, which drills down into each constituent stock to make sure it's aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate, the Enhanced funds will seek to meet the same goal at the portfolio level.

As a result, the number of stocks eligible for inclusion in each fund is more than double that of the Paris-Aligned funds, at 1,385 compared with 685.

This allows the funds to have a much closer risk-return profile to the parent index and potentially be more attractive to wealth managers keen to invest more sustainably but worried about diverging from the returns of the parent.

With climate change rewriting core assumptions in modern finance, he argued, trillions of dollars are at stake. “Sooner than most anticipate, there will be a significant reallocation of capital,” Fink wrote. “We believe that sustainable investing is the strongest foundation for client portfolios going forward.”

With that, the financial industry was put on notice. Climate change is now the lens through which Blackrock, and everyone following the world’s largest asset manager, will need to assess its next investment. Mindy Lubber, CEO of nonprofit Ceres, which pushes for climate action in the business community, says BlackRock is dragging the rest of the industry with it: “When they move, a lot of people follow.”

Now that climate change is looming over Wall Street, the trickle of companies announcing commitments to push for emission cuts has swelled to a deluge. BlackRock doesn’t deserve all the credit. It’s just the latest (and biggest) player to shatter the delusions that companies could ignore the climate catastrophe, and their role in it. That’s part of a wider shift toward stakeholder capitalism, one backed by top CEOs who want the purpose of a corporation to include benefiting “all stakeholders—customers, employees, suppliers, communities and shareholders.”

BlackRock has vowed to prove this is more than rhetoric: It promised to screen all investments against sustainability criteria, and to begin divesting from companies such as thermal coal producers. But make no mistake—BlackRock is doing this for money. “Actions that damage society will catch up with a company and destroy shareholder value,” Fink wrote last year. “Ultimately, purpose is the engine of long-term profitability.”

Doing good, paying dividends

BlackRock has been called the “Swiss Army knife” of the financial world. It’s not a bank. But it manages and monitors huge sums of money as an institutional investor, money manager, and private equity firm. Savvy maneuvering—and perhaps its focus on environment, social, and governance (ESG) risks—has helped BlackRock eclipse almost every other major asset manager’s stock market performance over the last two years. BlackRock’s market capitalization has soared 80% from the depths of the pandemic-fueled market crash last March (only Schwab recently caught up).

This tracks the superior market performance of ESG investments across the board. Funds screening out bad actors for environment, social, and governance issues saw four times more cash flow into them in 2020 relative to the same period the previous year. Many outperformed the S&P 500.

A brief history

1988: BlackRock is founded.

1999: The firm goes public with $165 billion in assets and sells access to Aladdin, its in-house risk management tool.

2014: BlackRock sets up its first indices that exclude fossil fuels.

Advertisement

2020 (January): Fink pens “A fundamental reshaping of finance” as his annual letter to CEOs. In it, he predicts massive climate impacts on the financial sector and joins ClimateAction 100+, a global consortium of investors pushing companies to zero out emissions.

2020 (December): BlackRock’s Aladdin Climate is launched, quantifying climate risk for many of the world’s largest pension funds, asset managers, and other institutional investors. Aladdin monitors $18 trillion in assets for 200 financial firms. BlackRock formally announces it will “be incorporating climate risk across our platform as a critical investment risk like liquidity risk.”

Climate commitments

In 2020, Fink laid out a list of commitments for BlackRock to put “sustainability at the center of our investment approach.” Here are some of the most important:

⛏️ Divest from thermal coal companies.

Advertisement

🌡️ Ask for companies’ climate plans to operate in line with Paris Agreement targets for less than 2°C of warming.

💰 Offer ESG options for all active portfolios and advisory strategies and eventually convert all financial products to include ESG screens.

📆 Move from annual to quarterly voting disclosure with an explanation of decisions.

👁️ Expand the number of companies under climate scrutiny from about 440 companies (of which 191 were put “on watch” for lack of progress in 2020) to more than 1,000.

Advertisement

👎 Vote against management that fails to act: “Where we believe companies are not moving with sufficient speed and urgency, our most frequent course of action will be to hold directors accountable by voting against their re-election.”

🗣️ Take responsibility for lobbying: “We will now seek confirmation from companies, through engagement or disclosure, that their corporate political activities are consistent with their public statements on material and strategic policy issues…and to provide an explanation where inconsistencies exist.”

🌎 Start accounting for natural capital: “In January 2021, we will provide a more holistic commentary on our approach to natural capital…[that] will also address how we expect affected companies to manage the scarce water and energy resources on which they depend to avoid negative impacts that could impair their ability to operate.”

Power of the proxy

In 2020, BlackRock held major stakes in more than 90% of S&P 500 companies—its average share was 7.7%—giving the asset manager an outsized say in what companies and executive teams do. A vote against management by BlackRock could easily tip into majority support, and BlackRock’s own analysis suggests 94% of companies fully or partially adopt shareholder resolutions when votes exceed 50%.

“BlackRock is unique because of its scale,” says Judy Samuelson, founder of the Aspen Institute’s Business and Society Program. As a universal owner with $7.8 trillion in assets, it holds shares in every major industry across the business world. “They can’t exit a stock,” she says. “They have to continue to hold it.”

It’s a level of influence BlackRock says it intends to use. In its 2021 stewardship report (pdf), the company said it would vote against re-electing directors at companies it believes aren’t moving with sufficient urgency. But in the first half of last year, BlackRock didn’t live up to its rhetoric: The company actually opposed slightly more environmental shareholder resolutions than it had a year before, even as rivals such as JPMorgan tripled their support.

BlackRock says it updated its voting policies in July and was engaging directly with management to fix perceived shortfalls. Indeed: Between July 1 and Dec. 4, the company cast 22 votes on environmental and social shareholder proposals, supporting half of them.

ESG investing will soon just be…investing

ESG investing once represented a marginal activity in the financial world, but it’s about to move to the center of it. Assets in ESG funds soared to $1 trillion in 2020, according to UBS. More net money flowed into ESG funds between April and July 2020 than the entire previous five years.

Why? Returns are higher, and volatility is lower. In a world of negative interest rates, cash is racing around the globe chasing higher returns and havens from volatility.

This year, BlackRock said all its active portfolios and advisory strategies will account for ESG, and it will continue to generate and share more data on companies’ ESG performance (60% of publicly traded firms (pdf) already disclose something about climate risk). “Sustainable investing was once viewed as a trade-off between value and ‘values,’” Fink wrote in February 2019. No longer.

BlackRock also recently launched Aladdin Climate, software that calculates portfolios’ climate risk by crunching data on a company’s energy, carbon emissions, waste, water, and efficiency metrics. Aladdin Climate now allows BlackRock—and its clients—to stress test their portfolio under different scenarios, such as net-zero transition under the Paris Agreement.

But as the Aspen Institute’s Samuelson argues (and BlackRock acknowledges), this alone won’t be enough. “ESG funds are not the answer,” she says. “They are noise in the system. The goal is to have the financial markets work better. Ultimately, this should be about having two classes of good stocks and bad stocks. We need to raise the bar.”

The US Federal Reserve, along with peer central banks from around the world (including the Reserve Bank of Australia), have signalled further monetary policy tightening over the coming months.

The hawkish outlook has come off the back of stronger than anticipated inflation figures, with the US recording annualised inflation of 6.4 per cent in January.

Aggressive tightening over the course of 2022 dampened demand for growth stocks and fuelled investment in value stocks, according to BlackRock data.

As such, renewed commitments to monetary policy tightening from the central banks in 2023 are expected to produce a similar trend.

“We believe value stocks can resume their climb as major central banks keep interest rates higher for longer,” BlackRock observed.

“Higher rates reduce the value of future cash flows, weighing more on growth stocks and reinforcing our developed market equities underweight.

“Underneath that, our sector and region preferences tilt to value with quality attributes and growth at a reasonable price.”

BlackRock acknowledged value stocks typically underperform in the lead up to a recession, which has been forecast later this year.

However, companies in “the value bucket” have “had time to prepare for a well-telegraphed downturn”, including banks, which have “already provisioned for losses in advance of a recession”.

Moreover, the asset manager is forecasting a “mild recession”, which is likely to result in a “softer” performance impact on value stocks.

BlackRock has touted emerging markets (EM) and European value stocks, which have “consistent value bias”.

On a sector level, the asset manager has backed energy companies, which have “a fusion of value and quality”.

“We find value in the sector after being unloved and undisciplined with capital in the past,” BlackRock observed.

“We think its stronger balance sheets, better investor payouts, and improved return on equity give it more of a quality tilt.”

Other sectors touted by the firm include healthcare and financials — the latter of which can capitalise on higher rates with improved net interest margins.

“We prefer to be selective within our cautious view of developed market equities,” BlackRock noted.

“We like sectors and regions with a value bent while we stay nimble in this new regime of heightened macro and market volatility.

“We think structurally higher inflation, higher for longer interest rates and our expectation for a steeper yield curve all favour value.”",BlackRock spruiks value stocks in ‘higher for longer’ rate environment

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has made it clear he believes a sustainable finance ""revolution"" is underfoot. In the past year, Fink and BlackRock have repeatedly stated both the imperative for climate finance action and the trillion-dollar investment opportunities emerging.

The world’s largest asset manager has stepped up on engagement, public transparency, investor education and investing in zero emissions new industry opportunities, and pushed for comparable global climate risk disclosures (albeit voluntary) such as the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosure (TCFD).

And while the company staunchly insists that divestment policies are a last resort, it has started to divest from coal projects. The company is part of the 186 globally significant financial institutions with formal coal divestment policies, and by the end of the year, BlackRock is expected to release its interim target goal as part of its commitment to reach net zero by 2050.

Fink, along with Mark Carney, U.N. special envoy for climate action and finance, has also championed increasing climate investment by the U.N. Global Finance Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) to $130 trillion, almost double the total of just six months ago. It was one of the major milestones of COP26.

All this sounds like a lot of progress. And in many ways it is. So why is BlackRock risking all this climate goodwill by continuing to hold investments in one of the world’s largest fossil fuel polluters, India’s private power giant, Adani? While family-owned Adani is rapidly developing its renewable energy arm, the group continues to be one of the biggest global developers of new coal and gas projects.

BlackRock’s estimated cumulative exposure to the Adani Group is over $1.2 billion in debt and equity, according to our calculations (see chart). It has large investments in Adani Power, which is 100 percent coal power, two Adani port interests that are international fossil fuel export hubs, and Adani Total Gas. It also invests in Adani Green Energy, the company’s wind and solar energy arm.

The Indian conglomerate’s carbon footprint is massive and growing, which makes BlackRock’s investments even more perplexing. Adani is possibly the largest single private developer of new coal projects globally with 110 million metric tonnes per annum of new Indian coal mine capacity under development and 9GW of new coal power plants.

How many Blackrock investors know this? Are they OK, for example, with BlackRock investing in Adani Ports, the largest coal and LNG import infrastructure provider in India? Or that Adani Ports, along with Adani Enterprises, has regularly invested in the controversial Carmichael coal mine-to-port project in Australia?

In addition to importing LNG, Adani is also developing ambitious gas reticulation, or gas pipe and distribution systems, to distribute the gas to consumers in India.

Most egregious is Adani’s plan to use part of the coal it mines and exports from Carmichael to fuel a $4 billion coal-to-PVC plant that will not only consume 3.1 million tons of imported coal annually but will produce 2 million tons of plastic each year.

That project is not only unbankable but has severely tarnished Adani’s image internationally and in Australia, where it is seen by many as a climate-threatening ""folly."" The project is also close to a decade behind schedule and continues to face major ongoing objections from traditional Indigenous landowners.

Investors and insurers are running away from the project as a result of this and other ESG issues. The S&P Dow Jones recently removed Adani Ports from its sustainability indices in April and MSCI has dropped Adani Ports from its climate indices over the Carmichael controversies. Why Adani was included in sustainability and climate indices is another story in itself.

One would have thought BlackRock had learned its lesson over the costs associated with taking such risky bets on fossil fuels. Two years ago our Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) wrote about the financial costs of climate inaction for BlackRock’s investors in the wake of devastating wealth destruction at GE and Exxon.

Real climate leadership requires BlackRock and other investors to call out and possibly divest from global laggards at the company group level, not just at a subsidiary level.

Fink should also know that investing in fossil fuels is a major wealth — not to mention ESG — hazard. Momentum is shifting away from fossil fuel development. Notwithstanding the massive post-COVID fossil fuel inflation evident in 2021, an event that is likely to accelerate investment in low volatility, domestic and cheaper zero-emissions energy, the financial and climate risk of investing in fossil fuel assets grows daily.

A key trigger was the International Energy Agency’s (IEA) profound pivot earlier this year when it said that to get to net zero emissions by 2050 means the world can’t afford any new oil, gas or coal developments.

It has also been helped by the escalating global climate policy leadership of China, Japan and South Korea in the last 12 months. They have strengthened the EU’s sustained net zero conviction and its moves towards a fossil-free transition.

In October, for example, the Bank of China surprised all when it announced it would stop exporting coal plants abroad, sounding a death knell for new coal power, following the exits of Japan and Korea. China’s historic support for coal-fired power projects in developing countries is history and the greening of the Belt and Road Initiative has begun.

All of this has been elevated by the return of the U.S. to the Paris Agreement under President Joe Biden, who is driving ambitious interim 2030 carbon targets. These were recently reinforced by the China-U.S. Joint Declaration where both countries agreed to increase cooperation to manage the carbon transition.

The groundswell to align with the IEA policy shows no sign of slowing down, what with new leadership initiatives from the likes of the European Investment Bank. When the new Asian Development Bank (ADB) climate policy was watered down to leave its gas policy ambiguous (thanks to Japan), we saw a very telling — and rare — U.S. vote abstention. When an EU commitment to climate action was recently undermined by gas industry lobbyists and Euorocratoc wavering thanks to the Russian-EU gas crisis, it was great to see China step in and take an opposite approach — and become the global leader for driving for a credible green finance taxonomy by making it clear that it does not see natural gas as an investable ""green energy"" source.

Interest in fossil fuel divestment continues to grow as well. ABP of Netherlands, AXA of France, First Republic Bank in the U.S. and Zurich of Switzerland have all made recent divestment announcements. While some are skeptical of fossil fuel divestment, we at IEEFA feel this thinking ignores the growing global capital flight from fossil fuels, starting with thermal coal but spreading to coking coal, oil and gas. With the growing tsunami of capital reallocation away from high emissions assets into zero-emissions industries of the future, divestment is an important tool to decrease fossil fuel supply and increase the risk of stranded fossil fuel assets.

All these actions are not being ignored by investors. Wood Mackenzie warns that the pool of climate-agnostic investors continues to shrink. Add to that the growing threat of $60 billion of unfunded rehabilitation liabilities alone for offshore Australia and the risk is significant enough to force even climate science-denying governments to act to avoid taxpayers being left holding the liabilities.

BlackRock’s legalistic defense of its Adani investments strains credibility and seems increasingly out of touch with changing investor sentiment.

Financial markets are also sending a strong signal on the growing understanding of climate risks. EU emissions trading system (ETS) hit successive record highs this week of $89 a ton, trebling in the last year and up tenfold over five years.

This increasingly puts the onus on the world’s largest investors to act in more meaningful ways to accelerate the end of the use of fossil fuels. A critically important step was taken at COP26 with the GFANZ $130 trillion agreement. Now action must follow pledges.

The next imperative for financial firms is to lift the bar and cull the nonsense idea that global climate financial laggards can be included without any decisive change in their investing and lending practices. They may have no choice as U.S. regulatory scrutiny increases. The U.S. Treasury’s Financial Stability Oversight Council has identified climate as a major financial risk. This adds to the weight of the Security and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) actions to reduce investor deception from greenwash.

Given this, BlackRock’s legalistic defense of its Adani investments strains credibility and seems increasingly out of touch with changing investor sentiment. BlackRock argues that investing in one subsidiary is not the same as investing in another subsidiary. This is fallacious thinking for a family-controlled conglomerate that has intercompany transfers as standard operating procedure. BlackRock must call out and divest global laggards at the group level, for both debt and equity exposures, not just at a subsidiary level. Hiding behind the passive excuse is greenwash and action on changing indexes is overdue.

Nor can BlackRock use its often claimed strategy to use its influence and private persuasion with companies such as Adani. It is well known to many that engaging with Adani on ESG issues has been entirely ineffective. Real climate leadership requires BlackRock and other investors to call out and possibly divest from global laggards at the company group level, not just at a subsidiary level.

IEEFA has long trumpeted the developing world leadership of India’s energy transition, and how strong government policy frameworks and partnering with global capital are driving an unstoppable momentum for the decarbonization of the Indian economy. Solar costs are half that of imported coal-fired power generation in India. And with solar installs doubling in 2021 relative to last year, India provides a clear example of how other developing countries can leverage global finance to drive both decarbonization and technology developments so as to grow more sustainably.

Moves by corporate leaders such as Tata Power and Reliance Industries’ net zero by 2035 suggest a massive acceleration in Indian ambition. Adani’s corporate position, however, is far worse than an each-way bet. The Adani Group uses its political power to wrangle political tax concessions, adverse contract revisions and public financing that are otherwise unviable and/or unbankable and undermine the energy transition leadership of India.

We would encourage BlackRock to use its full, unprecedented fiduciary power to underpin and accelerate the advances achieved at COP26, including its massive index position. When a $10 trillion giant moves decisively, the global investor pack will follow.

The Letter focuses on the importance of sustainability issues to companies from a financial perspective, and seeks to highlight the economic benefits of stakeholder capitalism.

Fink’s 2020 and 2021 Letters to CEOs also drew attention to sustainability issues, noting that climate change had “become a defining factor in companies’ long-term prospects”. Given BlackRock’s status as the world’s largest asset manager by assets under management, such public statements have been and will continue to be noted by leaders of public companies throughout the US and globally.

This post examines key focus areas of the Letter.

Capital’s Shift to Sustainability

Drawing on the growth of the sustainable finance markets, the Letter notes that sustainable investments globally have now reached over US$4 trillion, and the actions and ambitions of economic actors towards decarbonisation have increased markedly over the past two years. Fink said he expects this growth in sustainable economic activity to continue at pace, stating that “every company and every industry will be transformed by the transition to a net zero world. The question is, will [companies] lead, or will [they] follow?”

Net Zero Transition Risks and Opportunities

The Letter notes that the energy transition can both positively and negatively impact companies, which is why strategy and resilience to transition risks are identified as key drivers of long-term economic potential. The Letter asks what leaders of public companies are currently doing and will do to “disrupt” their business, and whether, as industries are transformed by the transition, their businesses will go the way of the “phoenix” and reinvent themselves for long-term success, or go the way of the dodo. To support this question, the Letter predicts that “the next 1,000 unicorns won’t be search engines or social media companies, they’ll be sustainable, scalable innovators – startups that help the world decarbonise and make the energy transition affordable for all consumers”, and adds that established companies should endeavour to do likewise.

The Letter acknowledges that the pace of the energy transition will be very different in developed and developing countries, a reflection of the Paris Agreement, which highlights the “common but differentiated responsibilities” of nations around the globe. The Letter notes, however, that “all markets will require unprecedented investment in decarbonisation technology”, and that investment in green technologies should be fostered to ensure that they become scalable and affordable.

Responsibilities of Governments

The Letter focuses on the work that companies, particularly public companies, can and should do to prepare for the energy transition, but it also stresses that whilst “capitalism has the power to shape society and act as a powerful catalyst for change…businesses can’t do this alone” and that national governments and public sector organisations must play a key role. The Letter states that governments need to “provide clear pathways and a consistent taxonomy for sustainability policy, regulation and disclosure across markets”. Global efforts in this regard include certain aspects of the EU Green Taxonomy going into effect at the start of 2022, and the International Sustainability Standards Board undertaking work in relation to developing a set of globally recognised corporate environmental, social, and governance (ESG) reporting standards.

Corporate Purpose

In the current global environment, the Letter observes that businesses have the opportunity and obligation to lead on “societal issues intrinsic to companies’ long-term success”. Identifying that CEOs now have a greater platform than at any other time in history, the Letter states that “[i]t’s never been more essential for CEOs to have a consistent voice, a clear purpose, a coherent strategy, and a long-term view. [Their] Company’s purpose is its north star in this tumultuous environment”.

The overarching message of the Letter is that BlackRock’s focus on sustainability is a recognition that sustainability issues (and companies’ readiness for the transition to net zero in particular) play and will continue to play a fundamental role in the long-term economic outlook of companies. Summing up, the Letter states that “companies perform better when they are deliberate about their role in society and act in the interests of their employees, customers, communities, and their shareholders”. The impact of the Letter, and whether it will serve to continue to magnify the attention placed on stakeholder capitalism in 2022, will be interesting to monitor as the year progresses. Clearly, such issues are already of paramount importance for the world’s largest asset manager.",BlackRock 2022 Letter to CEOs Highlights the Importance of Sustainability

""Because better sustainability disclosures are in companies' as well as investors' own interests, I urge companies to move quickly to issue them rather than waiting for regulators to impose them,"" BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said Tuesday in his annual letter to CEOs.

The corporate world is waking up to the fact that so-called ESG factors — environmental, social and governance metrics — pose financial risk, and companies that don't adapt will be left behind.

Indeed, Fink said in his letter that as investors tilt their holdings toward companies focused on sustainability, ""the tectonic shift we are seeing will accelerate further.""

""More and more people do understand that climate risk is investment risk. ...When finance really understands a problem, we take that future problem and bring it forward. That's what we saw in 2020, and what we're seeing now,"" Fink said Tuesday on CNBC's ""Squawk Box.""

""The flows even in January into sustainability funds are growing, not shrinking, and this is going to continue in 2021,"" he said.

ESG investing became widespread during the bull market boom, leading many to view it as simply a bull market phenomenon. But amid the sell-off in stocks as the coronavirus roiled markets in March, investors piled into sustainability-focused funds. Many of these wound up outperforming their peers.

Last year, from January to November, investors in mutual funds and exchange-traded funds invested $288 billion globally in sustainable assets, a nearly 100% increase from the whole of 2019, according to BlackRock.

""They [investors] are also increasingly focused on the significant economic opportunity that the transition will create, as well as how to execute it in a just and fair manner,"" Fink wrote in his letter.

""No issue ranks higher than climate change on our clients' lists of priorities,"" he wrote. ""They ask us about it nearly every day.""

Amid the jump in ESG fund flows, some have said it's reached bubble-like territory and that valuations are beginning to look stretched for some of the most popular pure-play names related to the energy transition.

But Fink said that as in any new trend there will be some winners and some losers. He compared the sector to technology companies over the last 20 years, noting they ultimately grew into their earnings.

This isn't the first time Fink has sounded the alarm on the corporate world's role in climate change.

In his 2020 letter, he said a reshaping of finance was underway, and said the firm was overhauling its investing strategy in order to place sustainability at the center.

His 2019 and 2018 letters also focused on the idea of stakeholder capitalism, or that companies should seek a greater purpose beyond lining their shareholders' pockets.

Critics of ESG investing argue that it's difficult to score a company given the subjective nature of some of the metrics, as well as an overall lack of data disclosure.

In a bid for greater transparency, BlackRock said it is asking companies to state how their business model will be compatible with a net-zero economy.

In a separate letter to clients, BlackRock said it will help investors identify companies leading the charge by employing a ""heightened scrutiny model"" in its actively-managed portfolios. The firm will also create a ""focus universe"" of holdings that are particularly susceptible to climate-related risk.

With $8.68 trillion in assets under management, BlackRock's words and actions carry weight, and some argue the company's push toward a greener future is too little, too late.

Of course, its myriad offerings, including ETFs that track the S&P 500, mean it's difficult to unilaterally sell stocks of companies that engage in activities that might not align with a customer's values.

""It's encouraging to see BlackRock finally willing to remove companies from active funds as a consequence of moving too slowly on climate,"" said Gaurav Madan, senior forests and lands campaigner at Friends of the Earth. The environmental group is one of the partners in BlackRock's Big Problem, a global network of NGOs and financial advocates pressuring asset managers for change.

""This is a welcome shift in BlackRock's strategy,"" said Madan. ""But that threat alone is not enough at this stage of the pending crisis.""","World's largest money manager says sustainable investing surge to continue, pushes for more disclosure"

In its 2023 investor guide, Blackrock's iShares, one of the largest providers of exchange-traded-funds in the world, said the era of cheap money is over, and the higher-rates-for-longer regime is here to stay. ""Elevated levels of inflation should prevent the Fed from easing aggressively, even if a recession takes hold,"" Gargi Pal Chaudhuri, head of iShares investment strategy Americas at BlackRock, wrote in the Nov. 30 note. ""Although markets continue to trade on the possibility of a Fed 'pivot,' we think central bank authorities will raise and then hold rates in restrictive territory throughout 2023 – waiting for the long and variable lags of monetary policy tightening to feed through into the economy."" This shift brings with it ""profound implications for portfolio construction,"" Chaudhuri said. ""It is time to consider a new portfolio playbook."" She lists three ways investors can play this shift in markets. 1. Work your cash; buy bonds Chaudhuri said it was time to rethink the role of bonds, as a higher-rate environment sees fixed income yields rise. ""This is likely to drive a shift back into fixed income, as it returns as an investable asset class,"" she wrote. ""The rapid shift higher in yields has created significant opportunities in high-quality, front-end fixed income exposures."" BlackRock also said investors can earn income in the ""comparative safety"" of cash-like instruments through ultra-short duration securities. 2. Reallocate away from growth stocks Growth stocks, such as Big Tech, were an investor favorite in an era of low rates. But this year, tech stocks have been among the worst-performing sectors . Many investors remain hung up on the question of when to get back into the sector, but Chaudhuri said could be misguided. ""'Dip-buying' is often conflated with the question of 'when do I buy tech again?'"" she said. ""This implicit question fails to recognize the regime shift that has taken place: the accommodative monetary policy that drove the decade-long outperformance of growth (and large-cap technology in particular) is over."" As a result, BlackRock favors taking a defensive position on a tactical basis, preferring stocks such as health care and energy producers, as well as small-cap stocks which it says are trading at the largest discount relative to large-cap equities since 2001. BlackRock isn't alone in recommending investors go defensive ; Goldman Sachs recently said investors should continue to position themselves defensively going into 2023 as the stock market hasn't yet hit its trough. In its 2023 outlook, Blackrock's iShares added that value-style equities provide exposure to the real economy – embodying ""a mature segment of the overall market – one that is more defensive in nature with higher earnings yields and less sensitivity to the U.S. consumer."" Infrastructure and agricultural producers are two such sectors, BlackRock said. 3. Live with inflation Inflation is set to stick around, given the continued strength coming from services and shelter, according to BlackRock. ""Even as the Fed's tightening begins to bite and economic activity begins to slow, we believe inflation will likely remain above the Fed's 2% target due to the stickiness of prices within services and other key consumption basket components, like shelter,"" Chaudhuri said. Investors should own inflation-linked bonds given this environment, BlackRock said. ""After spending a few years in negative territory, [Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities] real rates have repriced higher and have regained their role of providing a potential ballast in a multi-asset portfolio,"" it said.","BlackRock unit says it's time for a new portfolio playbook, and reveals how to position"

West Virginia’s Board of Treasury Investments, which manages $8 billion in state operating funds, has dropped BlackRock money market funds from its portfolio, citing concerns over the firm’s focus on environmental, social, and governance investing. The Board of Treasury also cited BlackRock’s holdings in Chinese companies for its decision.

On Monday, hours before BlackRock chief executive officer Larry Fink released his annual letter to CEOs, West Virginia State Treasurer Riley Moore announced the news.

“The decision was based on recent reports that BlackRock has urged companies to embrace ‘net zero’ investment strategies that would harm the coal, oil, and natural gas industries, while increasing investments in Chinese companies that subvert national interests and damage West Virginia’s manufacturing base and job market,” the announcement said.

Although West Virginia’s investment with BlackRock is minuscule — and low fee — compared to the behemoth’s $10 trillion under management, the decision highlights the potential political risk of CEOs like Fink addressing challenges such as the environment, social issues like income inequality, and making decisions based on multiple stakeholders, not just investors in its stock. Last year, in a huge move for an asset manager, Fink declared that “climate risk is investment risk.”



A spokesperson for BlackRock declined to comment on the news. Fink’s letter addressed stakeholder capitalism as well as the asset manager’s emphasis on environmental, social, and governance issues. Among other things, the letter covered the changing world of work, the explosion of new sources of capital, and an initiative to give clients more of a say in proxy voting. “We focus on sustainability not because we’re environmentalists, but because we are capitalists and fiduciaries to our clients,” he wrote.

Fink’s letter showed he is also aware of the criticisms of the firm’s policies based on politics. Fink went on to write, “Stakeholder capitalism is not about politics. It is not a social or ideological agenda. It is not “woke.” It is capitalism, driven by mutually beneficial relationships between you and the employees, customers, suppliers, and communities your company relies on to prosper.”

As of December 31, West Virginia’s money market pool held nearly $1.25 million in BlackRock liquidity indexes, according to the state’s monthly holdings reports.

Moore, the Treasurer, said investing with BlackRock “runs contrary” to his duty to ensure that taxpayer dollars are managed responsibly. He also said in a statement that he thinks BlackRock’s decision to invest in China is “a bad strategy,” because he believes the country has engaged in human rights violations and had a role in “creating the COVID-19 global pandemic.” However, the results of a U.S. Intelligence investigation in 2021 found no evidence that the COVID-19 virus was weaponized.

Moore’s message echoes that of a recent ad campaign run by a Washington, D.C.-based “anti-woke” group called Consumers’ Research that targeted BlackRock for these issues. That ad campaign claimed that BlackRock is “investing your money” in China and that the firm’s ESG policies were in violation of fiduciary duty laws. (It’s untrue that BlackRock’s ESG policies are in violation of any fiduciary duty laws.)

West Virginia’s Board of Treasury Investments is one of the first state managers of public funds to explicitly drop an asset manager for its ESG stance, although it may not be the last. In September 2021, a Texas law prohibiting state pension plans from investing with firms that boycott energy companies went into effect. So far, one fund, the Teacher Retirement System of Texas, hasn’t needed to drop any investments from its portfolio, according to the results of a regular year-end audit of compliance with such laws.

Even if TRS had, BlackRock likely would not be on the list of divested firms. According to Fink’s 2022 letter: “Divesting from entire sectors – or simply passing carbon-intensive assets from public markets to private markets – will not get the world to net zero. And BlackRock does not pursue divestment from oil and gas companies as a policy.”

Instead, he added, “We believe the companies leading the transition present a vital investment opportunity for our clients and driving capital towards these phoenixes will be essential to achieving a net-zero world.”",West Virginia Treasury Drops BlackRock Over Stance on Climate Risk

July 8 (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (BLK.N), the world's biggest asset manager, said on Thursday it has raised over $250 million for its climate finance fund to invest in select countries in Asia, Latin America, and Africa.

BlackRock's Climate Finance Partnership (CFP) will focus on investing in areas like renewable power generation, energy storage solutions, electrified transportation services and is targeting to raise at least $500 million, the company said.

The partnership's consortium of ten investors included the governments of France, Germany, Japan, and other philanthropies and institutional investors, BlackRock added.

The asset manager said that ""significant capital"" was required for climate infrastructure in these regions to help reduce carbon emissions.

""This ambitious partnership... will help redirect financial flows toward sustainable development investments across the emerging world, with a priority to Africa,"" Remy Rioux, chief executive officer of the French Development Agency said.

James and Kathryn Murdoch's Quadrivium Foundation and Jeremy and Hannelore Grantham's Grantham Environmental Trust are also part of the partnership.

PRAGUE, Nov 11 (Reuters) - Czech energy firm SOLEK has teamed up with BlackRock investment group to cooperate on building solar plants in Chile with capacity of up to 200 megawatts, SOLEK said on Thursday.

SOLEK will build up to 28 individual solar plants and connect them to grid via Chile's PMGD/PMG programme for distributed electricity production, in a deal between SOLEK Latam Holding and BlackRock's Global Renewable Power Fund III.

As of 2020, SOLEK, founded by Zdenek Sobotka in 2010, had 87.5 megawatts of installed capacity in its solar power plants, the company said.

Although the fund owned just 0.02% of Exxon, it secured its victory by winning over the company’s second largest shareholder: BlackRock, the world’s biggest asset management firm.

BlackRock and other asset managers don’t emit much carbon directly, but since they control how trillions of dollars of other investors’ money is allocated, they have enormous power to push carbon-intensive companies to clean up. Pension funds and other institutional investors wield the same power, with their own money. Short of selling their investments, voting in support of climate-related shareholder resolutions at companies’ annual general meetings is one of the strongest tools both groups have at their disposal.

But many investors and asset managers that have committed to decarbonize their portfolios—BlackRock included—still routinely either abstain from or vote against those resolutions, according to two new analyses.

What do analyses of voting records say?

The analyses examine the shareholder-resolution voting records of members of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ), an umbrella group formed in advance of COP26 that coordinates net-zero commitments from financial institutions and large investors.

The first, a Dec. 8 report (pdf), focused on the institutional investors within GFANZ, a subset called the Net Zero Asset Owners Alliance (NZAOA), which controls about $10 trillion and includes pension funds in California and Europe, as well as Swiss Re and other insurers.

The report found that since 2009, only 13 out of 46 NZAOA members directly voted on climate resolutions. And while those votes were more often than not in favor (a better record than non-NZAOA members), the remaining 33 firms left their votes in the hands of third-party asset managers, whose voting record is decidedly more mixed.

“If they are true leaders on net zero then a key metric needs to be voting on climate,” said Theodor Cojoianu at the University of Edinburgh, the report’s lead author. “And that hasn’t occurred so far.”

BlackRock and other asset managers aren’t supporting climate resolutions

That’s where the second analysis, released Dec. 15 by the London-based advocacy group ShareAction, comes in. It focused on the voting record over the last two years of the Net Zero Asset Managers, the GFANZ subset that includes BlackRock. In many cases, these firms vote on behalf of the institutional investors whose assets they oversee.

Overall, the group opposed about 30% of climate-related resolutions, the analysis found. And votes in favor were more likely to support resolutions calling for a company to do less anti-climate lobbying than requiring substantive changes to its operations or direct carbon footprint.

That’s a slightly better record than non-GFANZ asset managers, which opposed 39% of climate resolutions. But the individual track records of the three biggest asset managers—BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street, all GFANZ members—were actually worse than the non-GFANZ average. BlackRock, for one, opposed 47% of climate resolutions, State Street 58%, and Vanguard 62%. The “Big Three” also voted against a majority of resolutions related to social and governance issues, such as closing executive and gender pay gaps.

To decarbonize faster, companies need to feel pressure from shareholders

Asset managers typically defend their voting record by saying that their size and influence allows them to engage directly with company management on important issues rather than take the more aggressive approach of voting against them. The same goes for the even more aggressive—but popular with some climate activists—approach of selling their stake in carbon-heavy companies.

It’s fine for an asset manager to chat quietly with management in a back room if it leads to real near-term action, said ShareAction executive director Catherine Howarth, but it rarely works out that way. Asset managers that are serious about reaching net zero must set clearer, science-based expectations for companies in their portfolios (almost none of the major firms have a policy to exclude coal investments, for example) and be willing to sell or vote against those that don’t get in line.

And apart from the voting issue, they must be more transparent about their own net zero commitments—many GFANZ asset managers (pdf) exclude large portions of their portfolio from their emissions target, which lets them off the hook (pdf) from pressuring the most carbon-intensive companies. BlackRock, for one, hasn’t yet disclosed the details of its target, but CEO Larry Fink has promised to do so before the end of 2021.

Until then, with voting records like these, corporate boards (except maybe Exxon’s) are unlikely to feel much pressure from their biggest investors to take action on climate change, Howarth said.

Summary Companies U.S. asset manager backed Follow This vote at BP

Also backed two shareholder votes at Equinor

BlackRock supported management at Shell, Total

FACTBOX-Big Oil's climate targets















LONDON, May 28 (Reuters) - The world’s biggest asset manager and top BP (BP.L) investor BlackRock (BLK.N) said on Friday it had backed a shareholder resolution calling for faster climate action which the energy company’s board opposed.

BlackRock's vote at BP's annual general meeting earlier this month points to growing pressure on both major oil companies and investors to accelerate efforts to slash greenhouse gas emissions. BlackRock holds a 6.8% stake in BP, according to Refinitiv data.

""While recognizing the company's efforts to date and direction of travel, supporting the resolution signals our desire to see the company accelerate its efforts on climate risk management,"" BlackRock said in a vote bulletin.

The asset manager said, however, that it voted in favour of Total's (TOTF.PA) energy transition strategy at the company's AGM on Friday, which won over 90% of shareholder support. read more

It also supported management at Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) in a non-binding vote on the company's energy transition strategy at its AGM this month. Refinitiv data showed BlackRock is also the biggest investor in the company.

Managing $9 trillion in assets, BlackRock's vote has been a key focus for campaigners and investors alike, as pressure builds on the world's biggest oil companies to put in place a plan aligned with the 2015 Paris Agreement to limit global warming.

BlackRock said it had backed the BP shareholder resolution put forward by activist group Follow This, which asked for the company to set deeper climate targets. read more

Although the Follow This resolution was rejected, the 20% support it won was seen as a signal that a growing number of investors want CEO Bernard Looney to accelerate his plan to cut BP's emissions from its oil and gas production to net zero by 2050, which will see it reduce oil output by 40% by 2030.

BlackRock said it supports BP's climate strategy but that it also supported the Follow This resolution ""because we see it as a means to reiterate our expectation that BP progressively refine its GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions reduction targets.""

BP declined to comment on BlackRock's vote.

Criticised by campaigners for too often siding with management, BlackRock has toughened its stance with some companies in recent months, and this week backed boardroom change at Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) over its climate inaction.

With Total's annual meeting bringing an end to the European oil majors' AGMs for this year, BlackRock released voting bulletins for all four, detailing how it voted and why.

Before the AGM season began, BlackRock had warned companies it wanted to see them set climate related targets and report against them, or they could vote against the board. They also flagged a willingness to support more shareholder resolutions.

In the case of Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L), BlackRock said it supported a non-binding resolution filed by the company on its energy transition strategy and also voted against a shareholder resolution calling for Shell to set deeper short- and medium-term carbon reduction targets. read more

BlackRock said it backed the company because ""it meets our expectations that companies have clear policies and action plans to manage climate risk and provides a roadmap towards the company’s stated climate ambitions and targets.""

""We prefer the annual 'say on climate' advisory vote offered by management as a mechanism for shareholders to give feedback on the company’s climate strategy,"" it said.

At Norway's Equinor (EQNR.OL), the asset manager backed two shareholder proposals, against the advice of management, one calling for the company to set short-, medium- and long-term targets for greenhouse gas emissions, and one to report on climate and nature risk.

With regard to the targets, BlackRock said it backed the resolution in the hope that it would further speed up the company’s progress on climate risk management.

I love watching children at shul during the High Holidays and being a counselor at Jewish summer camp, but I don’t know if I want to ever have kids.

This prospect terrifies my parents.

The main reason for my uncertainty is climate change. How can I bring children into a world where we expect to cause more fires, floods and famines, more storms, droughts, epidemics and all of the other plagues that are forecasted for our future?

Many of us see that climate change is no hypothetical threat. We are already feeling its impacts.

For me and many other Bay Area students, wildfires cancel school and other outdoor activities on a regular basis, while similar fires have led to friends and family across California being evacuated. My family was also affected by Houston’s billion-dollar extreme-weather event last year — the Winter Outbreak — where my relatives lost power and suffered flooding.

That’s why I started organizing my local circle for Dayenu: A Jewish Call to Climate Action.

There was one day in the fire season 2021 when I woke up to an orange sky. It felt unnatural and apocalyptic. It left me full of dread and anxiety.

I’m not alone. Many of us toss and turn at night thinking about how to deal with these predictions. Even though I, as a privileged, upper-middle class, white person living in arguably the world’s richest country, am relatively shielded from the worst effects of climate change, I still am starting to see its impact on me and my communities.

My generation is frustrated that people in power — whether politicians, administrators or business leaders — have not taken necessary steps to address the climate crisis. Although many of our colleges and Jewish Federations have already divested from fossil fuels, trillions of dollars of American money is still invested in fossil fuels, keeping us deeply committed to this murderous infrastructure propped up by what Dayenu calls “The Schmutzy Sheva, aka the Dirty Seven” in this report.

Despite their promises, these seven organizations — banks and asset managers — still have deep investments in the fossil fuel companies. As part of Dayenu’s national All Our Might campaign, we in the Bay Area are targeting BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager. As part of its portfolio, which moved over $10 trillion in total assets recently, BlackRock is the world’s leading investor in oil, gas and coal, including $2.7 billion in tar sands and $85 billion in coal.

As an organization, BlackRock has committed to become net zero by 2050, meaning that their business operations and the companies in which they invest will be removing as much greenhouse gas from the atmosphere as they produce. That’s a significant and ambitious goal that would make them a leader in the sector. However, so far, they have not taken any tangible steps to make this commitment a reality.

We will be congregating at BlackRock’s offices at 400 Howard St. in San Francisco at 4 p.m. April 19 to explain our modern-day plagues and connect the asset manager to the climate crisis before giving a list of our demands to the management.

Just like Miriam, Moses and Aaron, we are calling on the Jewish community to actualize the idea of l’dor v’dor, to preserve our planet and traditions from generation to generation.

At the seder, we tell the story of the Exodus as if we ourselves were leaving an oppression that kept us enslaved.

As we confront this crisis, Jewish people from each generation have the responsibility to lead the exodus from human-caused climate change toward a more just and sustainable future.

In the spirit of Passover, a time where Jews stand up against injustice, we are calling on BlackRock to stop funding the fossil fuel pharaohs. We must break free from fossil fuels to ensure myself and the next generation, and potentially my future children, have a livable future.

On climate risk, it will continue pushing companies to disclose a net-zero-aligned business plan consistent with their business model and sector. In 2022, that will include asking companies to demonstrate that their plans are resilient under likely decarbonization pathways toward a global goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.

It also wants to see how companies are factoring in climate-related issues related to energy supply and ensuring that workers are not left disadvantaged in the transition to net-zero economies.

Last proxy season, BlackRock had more than 2,300 engagements on climate issues and voted against 319 companies, including the re-election of 255 directors.

More flexibility for companies using metrics was added ""in response to inquiries from companies, as well as greater interest among other stakeholders,"" the report said.

As sustainability reporting evolves, BlackRock plans to ask companies to report according to recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures but will also recognize standards other than those from the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, and push for industry- or company-specific metrics as well.

Overall, BlackRock said it supported 35% of 843 shareholder proposals that it voted on in the recent proxy season, up from 17% in the previous year. Of those, it backed about two thirds of the environmental resolutions, and about a third of the social and governance proposals, according to the report.

BlackRock said it voted against the re-election of 1,862 directors at 975 companies because of a lack of board diversity. Following the racial injustice protests last year, the world’s largest asset manager said it may vote against directors at companies that aren’t diversifying their ranks.

Summary Companies Private firms should face sustainability disclosures

More investment needed to bring down 'green premium'

Calls for role of global institutions to be overhauled















VENICE, July 11 (Reuters) - BlackRock (BLK.N) Chief Executive Larry Fink on Sunday called for governments to develop a stronger long-term climate finance plan to unlock the private capital needed to fund the transition to a low-carbon economy.

Speaking to The Venice International Conference on Climate at a meeting of G20 Finance Ministers, he said without such a plan, current efforts, including on corporate sustainability disclosures, risked being ""nothing more than window dressing"".

Fink, who heads the world's biggest asset manager, with around $9 trillion in assets, also called for reform of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to make them more suited to tackle the challenge of climate change.

Fink, highlighted three ""critical"" issues needed to power the ecological transition, which he said represented a $50 trillion opportunity for investors. BlackRock itself is a major investor in fossil fuels.

Firstly, he said private companies needed to be under the same pressure to share information on their sustainability efforts as public companies.

Currently, listed oil and gas companies had a ""massive incentive"" to sell out of more polluting assets, often to private and state-owned companies on which there is less scrutiny and which disclose far less about their operations.

Secondly, Fink said governments risked fuelling inequality unless they created more demand for greener products and services, lowering the cost, or 'green premium', that penalises the worse off and could fuel social instability.

Lastly, global institutions such as the World Bank and the IMF needed to be changed so they could do more to encourage private sector capital to help fund the transition in emerging markets.

He noted that the two bodies were created nearly 80 years ago based on a bank balance sheet model and said it was now necessary to ""rethink their roles.""

Citing BlackRock's role in the creation of a $250 million public-private climate finance strategy to help fund sustainable infrastructure, in which government and philanthropic investors provide subordinated capital to protect the returns of private investors, he said more of the same was needed.

""If we don't have international institutions providing that kind of first-loss position at a greater scale than they do today, properly overseeing these investments, and bringing down the cost of financing and the cost of equity, we're just not going to be able to attract the private capital necessary for the energy transition in the emerging markets,"" he said.

Private contributor Sir Jonathan Ive, Chancellor of the Royal College of Art and former Chief Design Officer at Apple also contributed to the round. Existing investors include Deutsche Boerse, Kibo Ventures, Mundi Ventures, Seaya Ventures and Founders Fund.

""The social and environmental challenges the world faces and the corresponding economic opportunities unlocked have put impact assessment at the forefront of the minds of investors and organizations. Having the support of such an influential group of backers and partners who share our vision for a more equitable, sustainable world is one more proof point that Clarity AI is on the right side of a real trend that we believe will continue to grow,"" said Rebeca Minguela, Founder and CEO of Clarity AI. ""Our technology shows our clients how their investments and other organizations are positioned to impact the world. We are a tech-native firm with an innovative platform that can integrate directly into any client's systems, which we already do for large global platforms, including BlackRock’s Aladdin platform, Allfunds, the largest global fund distribution network, Manaos, the platform at BNP Paribas Securities Services, and Clearstream, which has clients in over 110 countries around the world.""

Asset owners, asset managers, wealth managers and end investors are all fueling demand for investing strategies that align with their clients’ and/or their own values and investment conviction. Experiencing 15% growth in two years, assets under management allocated to sustainable investment strategies reached $35.3 trillion at the start of 2020 across the United States, Europe, Japan, Canada, and Australasia, and total sustainable investment assets under management equal 36% of all professionally managed assets under management globally.1

“The sustainable investment market is already more than one third of total global assets and growing rapidly,” said Jimi Macdonald, investor for SoftBank Investment Advisers. “Empowering investors to make informed decisions about social and environmental impact is a real differentiator, and we are delighted to work with Rebeca and her team to bring this technology to an even larger network of stakeholders.”

As a leading pure-play technology platform in impact evaluation and assessment, Clarity AI enables anyone to manage the impact of their portfolios, no matter the size, through proprietary technology and machine learning around the most relevant industry recognized frameworks, including ESG, TCFD and UN SDGs. Clarity AI also supports regulatory disclosure and client reporting, such as those required by SFDR and EU Taxonomy regulation, to help investors meet new sustainability obligations.

“Since announcing our initial investment and partnership earlier this year, BlackRock and Clarity AI have integrated their capabilities natively within the Aladdin platform. We continue to believe in the value of Clarity AI’s data and tools, and the enhanced transparency and flexibility they provide. By embedding Clarity AI within investors’ daily workflows through Aladdin, we’re collectively able to help more investors construct sustainable and outcome-oriented portfolios over time,"" said Samantha Tortora, Head of Aladdin Sustainability at BlackRock.

“Fifth Wall’s Climate Tech Fund is proud to invest in Clarity AI, fueling its continued growth as it brings societal impact to the real estate industry,” said Brendan Wallace, Co-Founder & Managing Partner, Fifth Wall. “At Fifth Wall, we are laser focused on helping the real estate industry assess the impact its assets have on the environment and climate change, and the World. Real estate is responsible for 40% of all CO2 emissions, and we believe Clarity AI is a highly strategic and valuable solution for real estate organizations that want to measure and mitigate their contributions to climate change.”

Clarity AI will use this new capital to continue developing its technology and to expand into new geographies and segments with strategic senior hires in all growth areas, including sales, marketing and partnerships.

The announcement comes in the wake of a court in the Netherlands instructing Shell to cut its carbon emissions far more aggressively than currently planned, while fellow supermajors ExxonMobil and Chevron also found themselves under heavy pressure over their under-ambitious decarbonisation plans.

In a vote bulleting BlackRock said: ""While recognising the company's efforts to date and direction of travel, supporting the resolution signals our desire to see the company accelerate its efforts on climate risk management.”

The investment house, which holds a 6.8% stake in BP, voted at the oil company’s annual general meeting earlier this month – spurred by activist group Follow This – to galvanise greater efforts at the operator to slash greenhouse gas emissions.

BP last August unveiled a bold new strategy to transform the 110-year-old company into an “integrated energy company”, including a pledge to boost spending on low-carbon energy tenfold to $5bn a year by 2030.

Reuters reported that Blackrock noted, however, that it voted in favour of French operator Total’s energy transition strategy at the company’s AGM last week, which won over 90% of shareholder support.

With some $9trn in assets on its books, BlackRock has emerged as a key target for campaigners and investors looking to ratchet up pressure on the world's biggest oil companies to raise targets in their plans to meet the 2015 Paris Agreement to limit global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.

BlackRock said it supports BP's climate strategy insofar as it met “expectations that companies have clear policies and action plans to manage climate risk and provides a roadmap towards the company’s stated climate ambitions and targets”.

But that it also supported the Follow This resolution ""because we see it as a means to reiterate our expectation that BP progressively refine its GHG [greenhouse gas] emissions reduction targets”, Reuters reported.

BP declined to comment on BlackRock's vote, according to the wire service, saying: ""We prefer the annual 'say on climate' advisory vote offered by management as a mechanism for shareholders to give feedback on the company’s climate strategy.”",Investment giant BlackRock backs calls for oil supermajor BP to 'accelerate' climate plans

Enforcement of the substance of this pledge comes next. And within that, BlackRock has moved massively on the issue of climate finance.

Just two years ago IEEFA wrote about the financial costs of climate inaction for BlackRock’s investors, with the devastating wealth destruction at GE and Exxon clear examples of engagement with no time limits, transparency or consequences. Fast forward to 2021 and BlackRock clearly, repeatedly, articulates both the imperative for climate finance action and the trillion-dollar investment opportunities emerging. And a net zero pledge is pending.

Self-interest is a powerful motive, and IEEFA’s own mission is based on the need for a sustainable and profitable energy sector. There is nothing more compelling to a finance executive than a review of a decade-long pair trade (buying one asset and shorting another) – going long Tesla / short General Motors. Or long Nextera / short Exxon. Or long Orsted / short Shell. Or long Adani Green Energy / short Adani Power (more on this last one below). Investing in fossil fuels is a wealth hazard, notwithstanding the fossil fuel inflation evident in 2021, an event that is likely to accelerate investment in low volatility, domestic, cheaper, zero emissions energy alternatives.

BlackRock has clearly stepped up on engagement, public transparency, investor education, and investing in the zero emissions new industry opportunities, pushing for comparable global climate risk disclosures (the Financial Stability Board’s Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, TCFD; Science Based Targets initiative; Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, SASB; and IFRS Accounting Standards) and even divesting (as a last resort for dinosaur industries in terminal decline i.e. coal power).

The International Energy Agency (IEA), clearly articulating for a liveable planet, made a profound pivot earlier in 2021, saying getting to net-zero emissions by 2050 means the world can’t afford any new oil, gas or coal developments. The global climate policy leadership of China, Japan and South Korea in the last 12 months has strengthened the EU’s sustained conviction, and this has been elevated by the return to the Paris Agreement of the U.S. in 2021 under President Biden, driving ambitious interim 2030 targets, reinforced by the China-U.S. Joint Declaration. The financial markets’ newfound understanding of climate risks may be evidenced by the EU emissions trading system (ETS) hitting a record high this week of €66/t, doubling in the last year, and up tenfold over five years.

BlackRock has been staunch in its insistence that divestment policies are a last resort, continuing to swim against the growing tide. There are now 180 globally significant financial institutions with formal coal divestment policies, including BlackRock itself (but only for its active debt and equity funds, and only for thermal coal mining, so one of the weakest globally). Engagement and voting can be entirely ineffective for promotor dominated firms like Adani Enterprises.

In October, Bank of China’s coal exit abroad policy sounded the death-knell for new coal power, following the exits of Japan and Korea. And China’s historic support for coal-fired power projects in developing countries is now history with the greening of the Belt and Road Initiative.

Meanwhile the groundswell to align with the IEA policy and divest all fossil fuels is building, with strong leadership from the likes of the European Investment Bank, ABP of Netherlands, AXA of France and Zurich. And when the new ADB climate policy was watered down to leave its gas policy ambiguous (thanks to Japan), we saw a very telling U.S. vote abstention against this weakness. And with the EU commitment to the necessary climate action undermined by gas industry lobbyists and wavering thanks to the Russian-EU gas crisis of late, it is great to see China stepping up as a global leader, driving for a credible green finance taxonomy.

While some in finance view divestment as a poor policy, to IEEFA this thinking ignores the growing global capital flight from fossil fuels, starting with thermal coal, but now spreading to coking coal, oil and gas. Even Wood Mackenzie now warns that the pool of climate-agnostic investors continues to shrink, elevating stranded asset risk. And the growing threat of $60bn of unfunded rehabilitation liabilities is significant enough to force even climate science denying governments to act to avoid taxpayers being left holding the can. With the growing tsunami of capital reallocation away from high emissions assets into zero emissions industries of the future, divestment is one tool to reduce growing stranded asset risks, particularly in the face of energy policy chaos.

IEEFA sees the critically important role that the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) is playing, given its pledge to align with a 1.5°C world, and interim 2030 targets. That GFANZ has grown to a US$130 trillion of collective assets (six times the size of the U.S. GDP) shows the momentum is entirely one-directional.

Having established this critical global initiative, the next imperative is to lift the bar and cull the nonsense idea that global climate laggards like Vanguard or JPMorgan Chase can be included without any decisive change in practice – something that massively diminishes the credibility of this pledge. With the U.S. Treasury’s Financial Stability Oversight Council identifying climate as a key financial risk, this adds to the weight of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) actions to reduce investor deception from greenwash.

Returning to BlackRock: the bar has been raised, but some gaping inconsistencies remain. One of the starkest is the fact that BlackRock has an estimated cumulative exposure to the Adani Group of India of over US$1,200m (debt and equity). This conglomerate is possibly the largest single private developer of new coal globally, with 110Mtpa of new Indian coal mine capacity under development today. And 9GW of new coal-fired power plants, more LNG import terminals, a US$4bn imported coal-to-PVC proposal, and new gas reticulation systems throughout India.

Adani’s brand in Australia has been trashed with its unbankable Carmichael coal folly, which is due to commence exports any month now, close to a decade behind schedule, and despite repeated traditional owner objections. While the Adani Group is a clear leader in investing in zero emissions industries of the future in India, it has failed to give even a pretence of alignment with the IEA roadmap.

BlackRock argues that investing in one subsidiary is not the same as investing in another subsidiary. This is fallacious thinking when it comes to a family controlled conglomerate that has intercompany transfers as standard operating procedure. BlackRock must call out and divest global laggards at the group level, for both debt and equity exposures, not just at a subsidiary level. Hiding behind the passive excuse is greenwash, and action on changing indexes is overdue.

Investing in Adani Ports is investing in the largest private coal and LNG import infrastructure provider in India, and related party transactions are an ongoing investor issue, whilst Adani Ports, along with Adani Enterprises, has regularly invested in the controversial Carmichael mine-to-port project, which is one of the largest new thermal coal developments in the world. As a result of this and other ESG issues, S&P Dow Jones removed Adani Ports from its ESG indices in April 2021 and MSCI will likewise drop Adani Ports over Carmichael controversies in November 2021.

IEEFA has long trumpeted the developing world leadership of India’s energy transition, and how strong government policy frameworks and partnering with global capital are driving an unstoppable momentum for the decarbonisation of the Indian economy. Solar costs are half that of imported coal-fired power generation in India. India provides a clear example of how other developing countries can leverage global finance to drive both decarbonisation and technology developments so as to grow more sustainably.

Moves by corporate leaders like Tata Power and Reliance Industries’ net zero by 2035 suggest a massive acceleration in Indian ambition. Adani, on the other hand, is undermining the energy transition leadership of India with the Carmichael project and 110Mtpa of new Indian coal mine capacity under development, while also greenwashing its coal expansion with claims that the business would go “from carbon positive to carbon-neutral, and further on to carbon negative”.

We would encourage BlackRock to use its full unprecedented fiduciary power to underpin and accelerate the advances achieved at COP26, including its massive index position. When a US$10 trillion giant moves decisively, the global investor pack will follow.

Summary Companies Measurement of exposure to ESG risk 'very limited'

'Few' have a comprehensive strategy in place

Data, definitions, resource all pose a challenge















LONDON, Aug 27 (Reuters) - Europe's banks are proving slow to act on sustainability and have only a limited grasp of their exposure to environmental, social and governance-related risks, a report for the European Commission by asset manager BlackRock showed.

The report, which will be used to help integrate sustainability into banking prudential rules, had proved contentious given the U.S. firm's role as an investor in many of the banks.

The bloc's executive was chastised by European Ombudsman Emily O'Reilly in November for failing to properly consider conflicts of interest in the awarding of the contract to BlackRock's Financial Markets Advisory unit.

O'Reilly said that the Commission had not failed in applying its procurement process, but that its rules on conflicts of interest were too vague and should be changed in the future.

In a 273-page report based on data and insights from a range of banking sector and other stakeholders, released on Friday, the study said policymakers should take more action.

""Despite increased efforts by banks and supervisors, this study finds that the pace of implementation to achieve effective ESG integration within risk management, prudential supervision, and business strategies and investment policies needs to be accelerated,"" the report said.

Banks are increasingly coming under pressure from investors and activists over their role in the global transition to a low-carbon economy, particularly over their role in funding heavy emitting companies in sectors such as energy and utilities.

Among the findings, the report said banks did not have a common definition of ESG risks, with most lenders yet to map how different ESG risks feed into financial risk and only a few having a risk strategy in place.

""ESG factors are widely, albeit sometimes superficially, integrated within lending policies, credit application processes, and due diligence, in particular for selected high-risk sectors,"" the report said.

""However, coverage is often limited and, for example, off-balance sheet investment activity associated with advisory or debt capital markets is often not in scope.""

Integration of ESG risk into risk models and stress testing ""is at an early stage"", and most banks have yet to integrate it into their internal risk reporting frameworks, it added.

Among the conclusions, the report suggested banks and supervisors work to develop a granular definition of the ESG risks, with some stakeholders calling for ambitious strategies with measurable objectives and timelines.

A Commission spokesperson said the executive planned to organise a discussion on the report together with members of the European Parliament and other stakeholders, and would use the content of the report to help formulate future policy proposals.

BlackRock's FMA, which operates separately from the asset management unit, said in a statement that it was pleased to deliver its study, as per its mandate from the Commission.

Summary Companies Asset manager buys climate-modelling technology

Agrees long-term partnership agreement with Baringa

Will collaborate on other climate-related solutions















LONDON, June 17 (Reuters) - BlackRock (BLK.N) said on Thursday it had agreed a deal with Baringa Partners to buy the consultancy's climate-modelling technology for use in its Aladdin risk management system.

Aladdin, used by money managers running trillions of dollars in assets to help build portfolios and manage the investment process, is an increasingly important revenue driver for BlackRock, which itself manages around $9 trillion in assets.

Baringa's modelling, meanwhile, is used by governments and financial services companies to manage climate risk and plan their transition to a lower-carbon economy.

The long-term partnership will see BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, acquire Baringa's Climate Change Scenario Model and integrate it into Aladdin.

""Investors and companies are increasingly recognising that climate risk presents investment risk. Through this partnership with Baringa, we are raising the industry bar for climate analytics and risk management tools, so clients can build and customise more sustainable portfolios,"" said Sudhir Nair, Global Head of the Aladdin Business at BlackRock.

The deal comes as a growing number of investors around the world pledge to align their portfolios with the global effort to cap greenhouse gas emissions by mid-century.

Financial details were not disclosed, nor were the terms of the partnership agreement.

LONDON, July 15 (Reuters) - The world's biggest asset manager BlackRock (BLK.N) has appointed Stéphane Lapiquonne to the newly created role of Head of Sustainability for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, according to a letter to be sent to clients on Thursday.

The move is the latest step by BlackRock to bolster its position in sustainable investing as clients increasingly look to invest with an eye on environmental, social and governance-related issues that can influence long-term asset value.

Lapiquonne, who joined BlackRock in 2010 in its Financial Markets Advisory team, is currently co-head of Continental Europe alongside Christian Hyldahl, as well as country manager for France, Belgium and Luxembourg.

Going forward, Lapiquonne, based in Paris, would be responsible for ""accelerating our sustainability transformation"" in the region, Stephen Cohen, head of EMEA, said in the letter seen by Reuters.

""...ensuring that we are delivering to you the best of the collective expertise and insights of our investment, client, technology and operations teams from across the region"", he added.

As a result of the move, Hyldahl, the former chief executive of Denmark's largest pension fund ATP who joined BlackRock in 2019, would take on sole responsibility for continental European business, Cohen said.

""He brings deep experience, insights and perspectives of both a European asset manager and a European client.""

Lapiquonne and Hyldahl, currently also head of the Nordic region, would continue in their respective country roles until successors have been appointed, the letter said.

Fink was speaking at this week's Green Horizon Summit as BlackRock – the largest asset manager in the world – announced it had raised $673m for the Climate Finance Partnership, a new infrastructure fund to finance projects tackling climate change in emerging markets.

The fund is backed by government-owned development banks from France, Germany and Japan which have provided first-loss capital to catalyse private investment.

It requires a lot of public investing alongside private investing. And I don't see that happening enough

The Climate Finance Partnership was “a great example” of the role public capital could play to mobilise much more private investment, Fink said.

He added that state-backed lenders as well as institutions such as the World Bank and the IMF should play a bigger role in providing first-loss capital for investments in emerging countries, which many private investors found too risky. There was a “huge amount of private capital” ready to be mobilised if the first-loss risk was mitigated, he added.

Risk of polarisation

Fink said a technological breakthrough was needed to meet net-zero targets, something that could be achieved if the public and private sectors teamed up, as demonstrated by the quick development of a vaccine against Covid-19.

“We have to have the same intensity, and we're going to have those breakthroughs,” Fink said. “But it requires a lot of public investing alongside private investing. And I don't see that happening enough.”

He warned the route to net zero should not be detrimental for emerging countries, which are currently highly reliant on fossil fuels and don’t have the means to pay for a carbon premium.

If we're not getting a fair and just transition, we're going to create more polarisation and more political uncertainty

To avoid this, de-carbonisation should be seen as mitigating demand rather than supply, Fink insisted. Lowering oil, gas and coal supply in a world that is still heavily reliant on fossil fuels, as is the case now, would only raise energy prices – which would unfairly impact the poorest people on the planet.

Instead, the world needed to develop the technology required to lower reliance on fossil fuels before squeezing production or hiking carbon prices, Fink explained.

“We need a fair and just transition,” Fink said. “If we're not getting a fair and just transition, we're going to create more polarisation in the world and more political uncertainty.” In those circumstances, the emerging world would simply not be able to afford a transition to net zero, he added.

Likewise, divesting from publicly-listed oil companies wasn’t necessarily a good solution as long as demand was high, Fink argued. As the production of European and North American oil companies was shrinking due to under-investment, demand was shifting towards Russia, Iran or Saudi Arabia. “That doesn't change the net zero world at all,” he said.

Fink, whose annual letter to CEOs this year focused on climate risk, said he understood the concerns of green activists and agreed that time was running out. But, he said, for asset managers such as Blackrock, educating and informing clients so they make climate-minded investments would not happen overnight.

The pathway to net zero would not switch “from brown to green”, but would go through many shades. “It is a process, and that requires planning, or we're going to have this imbalance and this unfairness.”

In the annual address, Fink reccomends to CEOs in the corporate sector the themes important for long-term stability and goals. On behalf of BlackRock, he said companies, cities, and countries that are not planning a carbon-free future run the risk of falling behind.

The links between capitalism and sustainability

“Most stakeholders – from shareholders, to employees, to customers, to communities, and regulators – now expect companies to play a role in decarbonizing the global economy,” the BlackRock CEO said in a letter. Fink added the distribution of capital and companies’ long-term operations depends on how efficiently the global energy transition is going to be managed.

Scientists and engineers are working on solutions for the decarbonization of cement, steel, and plastic, the letter reads. Trucking, shipping, and aviation, as well as agriculture, energy, and construction, are undergoing a great transformation, Fink added and stressed that he believes the decarbonization of the global economy would create the greatest investment opportunity the era.

The decarbonization of the global economy is going to create the greatest investment opportunity

“It will also leave behind the companies that don’t adapt, regardless of what industry they are in. And just as some companies risk being left behind, so do cities and countries that don’t plan for the future. They risk losing jobs, even as other places gain them, ” according to his letter.

The fact is that green products often cost more today, so reducing that green premium will be essential for a peaceful and fair transition, the co-founder of BlackRock claims.

Fink: We focus on sustainability not because we are environmentalists, but because we are capitalists.

“We focus on sustainability not because we’re environmentalists, but because we are capitalists and fiduciaries to our clients. That requires understanding how companies are adjusting their businesses for the massive changes the economy is undergoing. As part of that focus, we are asking companies to set short-, medium-, and long-term targets for greenhouse gas reductions,” Fink said.

Investments require a long-term approach

The transition to a carbon-neutral economy is moving at different speeds, he wrote. And it`s uneven with different parts of the global economy, according to Fink.

“To ensure continuity of affordable energy supplies during the transition, traditional fossil fuels like natural gas will play an important role both for power generation and heating in certain regions, as well as for the production of hydrogen,” he asserted.

In the letter, Fink says the pace of transition would be very different in developing and developed countries. But unprecedented investments in decarbonization technologies will be necessary for all markets, in his view.

The pace of transition will be very different in developing and developed countries

“And any plan that focuses solely on limiting supply and fails to address demand for hydrocarbons will drive up energy prices for those who can least afford it, resulting in greater polarization around climate change and eroding progress,” BlackRock’s chief executive warns.

Necessary sustainability strategies

BlackRock manages investment funds, and the assets it controls have just exceeded USD 10 trillion, far more than any other competitor on the planet. The management is convinced that directing capital to companies leading the transition would be essential to creating a net zero emission economy.

Fink: We need governments to ensure a consistent taxonomy for sustainability policy

“Capitalism has the power to shape society and act as a powerful catalyst for change. But businesses can’t do this alone, and they cannot be the climate police. That will not be a good outcome for society. We need governments to provide clear pathways and a consistent taxonomy for sustainability policy, regulation, and disclosure across markets, ” Fink said.

In this year’s address, Fink highlights the strategy of “stakeholder capitalism” in social issues that he says are essential for the long-term success of companies.

“Stakeholder capitalism is not about politics. It is not a social or ideological agenda. It is not ‘woke’. It is capitalism, driven by mutually beneficial relationships between you and the employees, customers, suppliers, and communities your company relies on to prosper,” says the CEO of BlackRock.

Care for the environment is guided by care for profit

In energy transformation, shareholders and other stakeholders must keep in mind both the long-term and the broader picture. Because there is no profit without capitalism, but there is also no capitalism without society, i. e. the market.

Apparently, global investment capital intends to stay in the game through strategies for the transformation of the economy and society following the adopted international conventions on the transition to a net zero economy. We have a long-term process ahead of us in which we will witness whether, and in what way, such global shifts will preserve business, jobs, energy stability, and above all the planet as we know it.","BlackRock CEO`s message for 2022: We focus on sustainability not because we are environmentalists, but because we are capitalists"

An estimated $50 to $100 trillion in capital investment is required to successfully transition to a net-zero global economy.1 BlackRock research shows that as more companies participate in the journey to net zero during this period of monumental economic change, active investors can increasingly find opportunities to outperform the traditional equities market in three ways: by incorporating sustainable insights into their investment strategies, identifying climate-related financial catalysts and incorporating them into the investment process, and seeking out investment opportunities in emerging technologies.

“ We’ve been clear about our conviction that sustainability criteria have material impacts on investment returns, and our latest research builds on our thesis,” said Rich Kushel, Senior Managing Director and Head of the Portfolio Management Group at BlackRock. “ The key to active management is our ability to consistently identify companies and data points that can help us generate investment alpha. The incorporation of sustainability analytics is an increasingly important component to assessing the potential of companies and technologies as sources of return.”

Providing More Active Sustainable Options

To provide clients with its active insights and more access to sustainable strategies, BlackRock is launching nine new funds and repurposing seven equity and fixed income funds with clearly articulated environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria embedded in their investment mandates and objectives.

Across the new funds, investors will have access to a flagship suite of broad ESG offerings across fixed income including total return, high yield, emerging markets, and low-duration bond strategies, as well as equities, including US growth and value as well as large cap and international strategies. In addition to this suite, climate and sustainable infrastructure equity strategies complement the new broad ESG offerings.

Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal.

A fund’s strategy of investing in securities of companies with low carbon exposure limits the type and number of investment opportunities available to the fund and, as a result, the fund may underperform other funds that do not seek to minimize carbon exposure. A fund’s low carbon exposure investment strategy may result in the fund investing in securities or industry sectors that underperform the market.

Funds that concentrate investments in specific industries, sectors, markets or asset classes may underperform or be more volatile than other industries, sectors, markets or asset classes and the general securities market.

The BlackRock funds are actively managed and their characteristics will vary. Actively managed funds do not seek to replicate the performance of a specified index. Actively managed funds may have higher portfolio turnover than index funds.

International investing involves risks, including risks related to foreign currency, limited liquidity, less government regulation and the possibility of substantial volatility due to adverse political, economic or other developments.

Two of the world’s most powerful money managers are joining forces to build a business on climate-change investing and raise one of the largest venture-capital funds dedicated to carbon-cutting technologies.

BlackRock Inc. and Singapore’s Temasek Holdings Pte. formed a new firm, Decarbonization Partners, to take stakes in startups that have the potential to reduce the world’s reliance on fossil fuels and meet the goal of zero-carbon emissions in three decades. They’re committing a total of $600 million to the effort, including $300 million of seed capital for a $1 billion first fund, and raising the rest from outside investors.

Eventually, Decarbonization Partners aims to manage billions across multiple funds, BlackRock Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink said in an interview with Bloomberg Television, adding, “I look at this as one of the greatest investment opportunities over our lifetimes.”

Although renewables are displacing coal in power generation and electric vehicles can be cost-competitive with gasoline-driven cars, there are no viable solutions for problems like large-scale storage of energy or clean alternatives to carbon-intensive cement and steel production. Hydrocarbons still dominate much of the economy because they’re cheap and easy to transport.

Today, the pools of money dedicated to clean tech are growing, but managers tend to focus either on the bleeding edge of innovation or cash-flowing assets such as solar arrays and wind farms. BlackRock and Temasek are zeroing in on late-stage VC, the point at which startups need greater amounts of capital to manufacture at scale and expand into new markets.

“As you look at the transition to greener options, there is obviously a need to address the gulf between the cost of what’s available today and the cost curve of those solutions,” Dilhan Pillay Sandrasegara, CEO of Temasek International, said. “That’s why private capital is required, to give these solutions a chance of making it to commercialization, to where the cost curves can be brought down to the levels of non-green options or even lower.”

Breakthrough Energy Ventures, founded by Bill Gates in 2015, is currently the largest VC player in sustainable energy. It has raised more than $2 billion for early-stage investing, where the risk of failure is high, and anticipates holding its stakes for 20 years or longer. Another, Energy Impact Partners, has raised $1.7 billion, mainly from power utilities and industrial companies.

More money is flowing into carbon-related investing. Dealmakers Chamath Palihapitiya and Ian Osborne plan to raise at least $1 billion for a publicly traded vehicle. Venture funding for climate tech startups totaled $16 billion in 2019, up from about $400 million in 2013, according to a PwC report published last year.

The first climate-investing boom between 2006 and 2011 ended poorly, with venture funds losing more than half the $25 billion invested. One notable bankruptcy was Solyndra, a solar-panel startup with financing backed by U.S. taxpayers.

Decarbonization Partners will operate like a traditional VC fund, asking investors to lock up money for about a decade and targeting annualized returns of about 20%. Fink offered $5 billion as a longer-term goal for assets under management.

“We’re going to be testing this, we’re going to be building it, we’re going to have proof of concept and then we’ll see,” he said. “This is not tens of billions of dollars. It may lead to those types of large-scale investments, but it doesn’t need to be that large-scale.”

Temasek, a state-owned investor that oversees about $230 billion, has pledged to reduce net-carbon emissions by its portfolio companies to half their 2010 level by 2030 and to zero by 2050. Because it controls Singapore Airlines, one of Temasek’s priorities is finding a sustainable and cost-effective alternative to jet fuel.

Pillay and Fink described their shared interest in making green hydrogen a practical replacement for fossil fuels. Decarbonization Partners also is targeting technologies in battery storage, autonomous driving and power grid reliability, as well as materials and process innovation for industries and infrastructure.

As the world’s largest asset manager, New York-based BlackRock has the reach and client relationships to marshal capital into new investment vehicles. Just last week, it raised $4.8 billion to buy renewable-power facilities and separately raised $1.5 billion from Temasek, the California State Teachers’ Retirement System and others for two exchange-traded funds. The ETFs use proprietary research and analytics to find stocks that’ll benefit in the low-carbon transition.

Fink has taken a vocal stance in the fight to reduce carbon emissions, declaring climate change an investment risk and pushing for sustainability. In his annual letter to CEOs in January, he said companies must disclose plans for making their business models compatible with a net-zero economy.

Temasek and BlackRock already are partners in a Chinese asset-management business and Temasek is one of BlackRock’s top shareholders. Pillay, who takes over as Temasek CEO in October, said he’ll judge the new venture’s success on two measures: the speed at which its investments help achieve carbon abatement in the economy, and profitability.

“We’re not going to look at sacrificing returns,” he said. “We may have to wait longer, given the early-stage element of this partnership, but we do believe the returns will come.”","BlackRock, Singapore’s Temasek in mammoth climate investing push"

Breakthrough Energy, a non-profit founded by Gates in 2016, announced Monday that it has secured investments from Microsoft, BlackRock, General Motors, American Airlines, Boston Consulting Group, Bank of America and ArcelorMittal.

The overall size of the investments was not disclosed but they reportedly amount to over $1 billion. Breakthrough Energy did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment.

The Washington-headquartered firm said the money will be used to fund its ""Breakthrough Energy Catalyst,"" a project launched earlier this year that's aiming to finance, produce, and buy the new solutions that will help underpin a zero-carbon economy.

Gates said in a statement that a ""new industrial revolution"" is required if the world is going to avoid a climate disaster.

""Half the technology needed to get to zero emissions either doesn't exist yet or is too expensive for much of the world to afford,"" said the Microsoft co-founder. ""Catalyst is designed to change that and provide an effective way to invest in our clean technology future.""

He added: ""By working with this growing community of private and public partners, Catalyst will take a global view of the energy innovation landscape – the key technologies, leading-edge companies, financing partners, and pivotal policies – and fund the projects that will have the greatest positive impact for our planet.""

The program will initially focus on direct air capture, green hydrogen, long-duration energy storage, and sustainable aviation fuel.

The two funds raised more than $1.5 billion, highlighting the increased focus on climate-aware strategies from global institutional investors. The BlackRock U.S. Carbon Transition Readiness ETF (LCTU) and the BlackRock World ex U.S. Carbon Transition Readiness ETF (LCTD) invest in large- and mid-cap companies, tilting toward those companies that BlackRock believes are better positioned to benefit from the transition to a low-carbon economy. The day-one investments into LCTU make it the largest ETF launch ever.

“ The energy transition is central to all companies’ growth. Winners and losers will emerge in every sector based on each company’s ability to adapt, innovate and pivot their strategies toward the low-carbon economy,” said Larry Fink, Chairman and CEO of BlackRock. “ Many of our clients share this conviction and we are helping them be at the forefront of the energy transition through next generation climate analytics and sustainable strategies. We believe that this combination will lead to better outcomes for them and society as a whole.”

The new ETFs seek to outperform their benchmarks over the long term by investing in companies that may be better positioned for the transition to the low-carbon economy. To capitalize on the energy transition, BlackRock’s Sustainable Investing unit developed and managed a proprietary strategy with institutional investors since 2018. The funds leverage a range of structured and unstructured data sources, advanced analytics and research-driven insights across five “pillars” (Fossil Fuels, Clean Technology, Energy Management, Waste Management, and Water Management) to derive a unique low-carbon economy transition readiness score for each company. For the two new funds, BlackRock systematically overweights or underweights individual companies relative to a benchmark based on their low-carbon economy transition readiness score. LCTU is benchmarked to the Russell 1000 Index and LCTD is benchmarked to the MSCI World ex USA Index.

Investors Leading the Transition

A consortium of global institutions invested in the funds, including the California State Teachers’ Retirement System (CalSTRS), Temasek, Sura Asset Management, Varma Mutual Pension Insurance Company, Profuturo Group, FM Global and RenaissanceRe. More than $1.2 billion flowed into LCTU making it the largest ETF launch of all time. Additionally, approximately $500 million was invested in LCTD, making it one of the largest ETF launches in history.

“ Our allocation to this strategy furthers CalSTRS’s goal to position our portfolios for the low-carbon transition,” said Chris Ailman, Chief Investment Officer at CalSTRS. “ Identifying and supporting opportunities that move CalSTRS and the global economy to a low-carbon future helps ensure we can continue to provide a secure retirement for California’s educators.”

“ Better data and analytics have catalyzed climate investing. We are at a pivotal moment in the history of investing and it is now essential to incorporate climate risks and opportunities into asset allocations and portfolio management,” said Timo Sallinen, Head of Listed Securities, Varma Mutual Pension Insurance Company.

“ Our purpose is to obtain the highest possible pensions for our clients, but we also are committed to the conservation of the environment and the fight against the effects of climate change so that we can all live in a more sustainable world. We firmly believe that these vehicles will help us achieve our goals,” said Juan Pablo Noziglia, CIO, Profuturo AFP.

Kevin O’Donnell, President & CEO of RenaissanceRe said, “ As a global reinsurer, we are uniquely aware of the long-term risks of climate change due to our central role in protecting communities from its impact. Investing in transition-ready companies furthers our leadership in risk management, while advancing the sustainability of our own investment portfolio.”

“ At FM Global, we’re committed to advancing global resilience to climate change and natural catastrophe risks. We are also committed to investing in strategies and companies focused on the energy transition, reducing the carbon footprint, and dedicating capital and talent towards developing breakthrough solutions that advance climate resilience. We believe such investments will generate positively differentiated returns, strengthening our long-term stability and profitability. As a commercial property insurer, this strategy aligns well with our efforts to put our capital to work to help increase the resilience of our clients and collective communities,” said Sanjay Chawla, Senior Vice President and Chief Investment Officer, FM Global.

Taking Action on Climate Change

In a paper published today, ‘A Sea Change in Global Investing’, BlackRock illuminates how the transition to a low-carbon economy will affect every investor and how successfully navigating the shift will require the nimbleness to embrace new strategies, especially those that consider the threat of disaster, regulations, technological innovations, and shifts in consumer preferences.

“ Leading global institutions recognize that climate risk is investment risk, and they are increasingly using ETFs as transparent and efficient vehicles to integrate this insight into their portfolios,” said Salim Ramji, Global Head of ETF and Index Investments at BlackRock. “ These ETFs provide an accessible way for millions of investors to invest in the climate transition for the long term and potentially benefit from this tectonic shift.”

BlackRock has taken action to advance sustainable analytics and data quality with new tools and partnerships with leading data providers. Last year BlackRock launched Aladdin Climate as the first software application for investors to measure both the physical risk of climate change and the transition risk to a low-carbon economy on portfolios with climate-adjusted security valuations and risk metrics. BlackRock also expanded and strengthened its data offerings with 1,200 new sustainability metrics through partnerships with Sustainalytics, Refinitiv, Rhodium and Clarity AI.

BlackRock manages a broad array of sustainable investment strategies, including many new sustainable solutions added in the past year across active, index, and alternative asset classes. BlackRock believes there are three approaches to climate-oriented strategies that help investors, which are to Reduce exposure to carbon emissions or fossil fuels, to Prioritize companies based on climate opportunities and risks or to Target key themes or asset classes. BlackRock’s latest carbon transition ETFs fit into the framework, helping investors prioritize investments in companies that may be better positioned to benefit from the transition to a low carbon economy.

In guidelines published on Thursday, the world’s largest asset manager said it was ready to vote against the re-election of directors if companies had not effectively managed or disclosed risks related to the depletion of “natural capital”, the world’s stock of natural resources. It may also vote in favour of shareholder proposals that highlight natural capital risks.

Sandy Boss, global head of investment stewardship at BlackRock, said the use of natural resources and climate change risks was deeply interconnected. “The world will not reach the goals of the Paris Agreement, let alone the aspiration to reach net zero emissions by 2050, without curtailing deforestation and accelerating protection and restoration efforts,” said Boss.

More than half of the annual output generated across the global economy is either moderately or highly dependent on nature, according to the World Economic Forum. However, illegal deforestation and burning have expanded across much of the Amazon, Africa and south-east Asia.

In October, BlackRock backed a shareholder resolution at Procter & Gamble which called on the consumer goods producer to report on its efforts to reduce forest degradation due to the expansion of palm oil production.

“We expect companies to implement processes to identify, manage and mitigate adverse impacts on the environment, and to provide robust disclosures,” said Boss.

Larry Fink, BlackRock’s chief, has become one of the industry’s most prominent supporters of sustainable investing. In letters sent each year to fellow chief executives, Fink has urged business leaders to adopt more rigorous environmental, social and governance standards to improve shareholder returns.

Critics however argue that BlackRock has not used its immense influence effectively, particularly when exercising its voting power on sensitive ESG issues.

Moira Birss, climate and finance director at the charity Amazon Watch, said BlackRock’s words were “toothless” in the absence of meaningful consequences for those companies that were not addressing environmental issues. “BlackRock should adopt a definitive no-deforestation and human rights policy with clear accountability mechanisms that result in concrete improvements for communities, ecosystems and the planet,” said Birss.

BlackRock also plans to toughen its assessment of executive pay, a topic that is expected to prove contentious at shareholder meetings this year due to job losses and widening inequalities created by the coronavirus pandemic.

BlackRock said on Thursday it would ask boards to explain how remuneration packages granted to executives are related to the interests of stakeholders including employees, suppliers and the communities in which companies operate.

Concerns about executive pay at Ocado, the UK online grocery supplier, prompted BlackRock to vote last year against the re-election of three directors and the remuneration report.

The pandemic has also led to complaints that workers in industries such as food processing and transportation have been exposed to higher infection risks which employers have either ignored or dismissed.

Boss said BlackRock expected companies to take steps to mitigate risks to staff that could arise from their business practices.

DSD Renewables, a solar PV and energy storage developer owned by Blackrock Real Assets, has acquired a six-site community solar-plus-storage greenfield project portfolio with 45 MW of solar and 88 MWh of battery energy storage systems (BESS) in Massachussets, USA.

The seller is solar developer Borrego and construction is set to begin in 2023.

The portfolio is part of the state’s Solar Massachusetts Renewable Target (SMART) Program which was launched in 2018 to incentivise solar development, with its long-term state-wide deployment target doubled in April 2020 to 3.2GW.

Under it, utilities pay their customers for solar production on a monthly basis; for 10 years for residential systems and 20 years for large commercial solar projects like DSD’s.

A portion of the sites’ offtake will be for community solar – individual households – and low-income subscribers will be eligible to receive electricity bill credits.

The SMART program includes extra savings or ‘adders’ for customers who install battery storage systems alongside their solar no matter how small, that being the only ‘adder’ without a minimum size.

Data centre services provider Markley Group will be one of the commercial subscriber anchor tenants of the sites.

All six are all solar-plus-storage and are in Acushnet (2), Freetown (2), Plymouth and Wareham. The smallest is 1.5MW solar/3.37MWh storage and the largest is 12.9MW/26.6MWh.

“Partnering with such a stable and efficient capital provider like DSD has enabled this portfolio to achieve its full potential,” says Borrego Vice President of Project Finance Adam Feldman.

“We’re accelerating community solar adoption for those who can benefit most while instituting a clean energy future for more residents and businesses of Massachusetts.”

Borrego bills itself as a developer, designer, installer and operator of commercial solar. DSD Renewables is today primarily an investor in solar projects, originally a start-up within GE but acquired by BlackRock Real Assets in 2020.",Blackrock-owned developer DSD buys solar-plus-storage development with 88MWh BESS in Massachusetts

(NYSE: BLK) today announced a minority investment in Clarity AI, a sustainability analytics and data science platform, as the firm continues to invest in delivering sustainable investing analytics and software for clients. BlackRock will integrate Clarity AI’s capabilities with Aladdin®, BlackRock’s end-to-end operating system for investment professionals.

Clarity AI uses big data and machine learning to create actionable sustainability and impact insights and expand these to a uniquely broad universe of companies, countries and local governments. Its proprietary technology and data science capabilities across environmental and social impact analyze more than 30,000 companies, spanning almost 200 countries. Clarity AI also supports regulatory and client reporting to help investors meet new sustainability disclosure obligations.

“Investors are galvanized around sustainability as a critical consideration in managing immediate and future risks, and better data is foundational to this,” said Mary-Catherine Lader, Head of Aladdin Sustainability at BlackRock. “As BlackRock makes sustainability its standard for investing, we are committed to raising the standards for ESG data and technology. We’re investing in new analytics and software in Aladdin and are also integrating capabilities from strategic partners like Clarity AI so clients can understand their investments’ social and environmental impact and risks. Clarity AI’s capabilities use machine learning to help Aladdin clients analyze a broader universe of companies, address their disclosure obligations and build more sustainable portfolios.”

“BlackRock’s investment in Clarity AI and the integration of our capabilities and comprehensive ESG, sustainability and impact data into BlackRock’s Aladdin platform will be transformative, bringing Clarity AI data and analytics to more of the world’s largest and most significant investors,” said Rebeca Minguela, Founder and CEO of Clarity AI. “This strategic partnership with BlackRock reflects the growing demand for our innovative approach in helping investors assess the impact of companies on our society and planet.”

Demand for sustainable investing accelerated rapidly in 2020. Global investors in mutual funds and ETFs invested $326 billion in sustainable assets in the 12 months to November 2020, a 97% increase over the same period in the prior year1. In addition, a recent survey2 of global investors shows that their allocations to ESG strategies are expected to double by 2025. Within the survey2, 53% of respondents cited concerns about “poor quality or availability of ESG data and analytics” as their biggest barrier to adopting sustainable investing. As more investors look for ways to evaluate the social and environmental impact of their investments, the need for improved ESG data and analytics in individual investments and across whole portfolios will continue to grow.

Clarity AI builds on the existing sustainability dataset in the Aladdin platform with additional forward-looking sustainability analytics and models, generated from data about companies. These insights complement traditional corporate ESG disclosures.

This investment is the latest step from BlackRock’s Aladdin platform as it continues to invest in its sustainability capabilities, which last year added 1,200 sustainability metrics and established data partnerships to help investors understand ESG and physical climate risks and opportunities.

BlackRock also recently unveiled Aladdin Climate, which helps investors understand and act on climate risk. It is the first software application to offer investors measures of both the physical risk of climate change and the transition risk to a low-carbon economy on portfolios.

BlackRock will join existing investors including Deutsche Börse, Kibo Ventures, Mundi Ventures, Seaya Ventures and Founders Fund.

The terms of the transaction were not disclosed.

In January 2021, BlackRock said under new voting criteria that it would hold corporate directors accountable when business plans do not adequately address climate change.

Both BlackRock and Vanguard Group voted in favor of Wells Fargo Chairman Charles H. Noski, who was easily re-elected at the company's annual meeting Tuesday. His election was opposed by the coalition of grassroots groups and sustainable investing advocate BlackRock's Big Problem.

A spokesman for coalition member Sierra Club said Wells Fargo ""has fallen significantly behind the curve when it comes to meeting the moment on climate action"" and that ""BlackRock and Vanguard did not live up to their rhetoric on climate action. We will be monitoring other pivotal shareholder votes closely and hope to see the largest investors step up to hold corporations accountable for their climate failures.""

Climate activists are targeting BlackRock as the largest asset manager in the world, whose influence ""can make or break climate action,"" the coalition said. It plans to continue holding demonstrations throughout April near BlackRock offices in New York, San Francisco, Boston, Miami, Boca Raton, Dallas, London and Zurich, and will continue to do so. In London, it has projected onto BlackRock's office a giant eyeball with the message ""All Eyes on BlackRock.""

Another climate activist investment group, As You Sow, criticized BlackRock for energy holdings in the BlackRock U.S. Carbon Transition Readiness ETF, which broke funding records on its first day.

The problem according to As You Sow, is that the fund holds major oil and gas companies, including Exxon Mobil, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Marathon Petroleum and Devon Energy; fossil-fuel powered utilities, including Berkshire Hathaway, Consolidated Edison and UGI; and oil field services and pipeline companies, including Kinder Morgan, Baker Hughes and Schlumberger.

""If this ETF is really named 'Carbon Transition Readiness' then I have to ask what we are transitioning to and what we are getting ready for?"" said As You Sow CEO Andrew Behar in a statement.

""BlackRock can do better. Investors who bought this fund thinking that the holdings are actively working on climate transition need to take a much closer look,"" he said. ""Based on our analysis, this ETF ignores Larry Fink's statement, 'climate risk is investing risk,' while doubling down on business as usual.""

BlackRock initially declined to comment for this story, but after publication a BlackRock spokesman responded with a statement that said, in part, that the ETF is an active ESG strategy designed to be a core U.S. large-cap equity holding, and that it uses proprietary climate analytics to assess “a company's ability to thrive in the transition to a low carbon economy.”

The resulting portfolio has almost 50% less carbon intensity than its Russell 1000 benchmark, the spokesman said.",Climate activists say BlackRock failing to lead on carbon transition

Many automakers were announcing deadlines by which they would stop selling ICE vehicles altogether, buoyed by investment analysts and favorable press. But BMW decided to focus on lifecycle emissions and pursued a flexible powertrain strategy by offering vehicles with several options: gasoline and diesel-fueled ICE, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, and battery electric vehicles. That approach received a frostier reception in the stock market.

In mid-2022, automakers, consumers, regulators, and investors were focusing on the transition from internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles to electric vehicles (EV). While this would reduce tail-pipe emissions, it ignored the fact that the production of EVs—and especially their batteries—increases emissions in the supply chain.

BRIAN KENNY: On April 3, 2020, a woman in Punjab, India posted a photo of the Himalayas on Twitter, taken from her rooftop – and it went viral. The photo itself was unremarkable. It became a sensation because that particular view simply hadn’t existed before that day, which came three weeks after the city was effectively shut down by COVID. Three weeks was all it took to wipe away the cloak of air pollution that obscured the iconic mountain range. The same phenomenon was taking place around the world as photos revealing deep blue skies emerged from the likes of Beijing, Rio, and LA. Scientists say that CO2 emissions dropped by as much as 7% in that period, the largest drop in history and the kind of impact we could expect if say, half of the drivers in the world converted to electric vehicles. But that of course is a big if. Today on Cold Call, we’ve invited Professor Shirley Lu to discuss the case entitled, “Driving Decarbonization at BMW.” I’m your host, Brian Kenny, and you’re listening to Cold Call on the HBR Podcast Network. Shirley Lu conducts research in the area of corporate social responsibility disclosure with a focus on topics related to climate change and gender diversity. Thank you for joining me today, Shirley.

SHIRLEY LU: Thank you for having me.

BRIAN KENNY: We’re going to touch on a couple of those topics today. So this is perfectly timely, and I think this case for me was super eye-opening in a lot of ways. I mean, I don’t have an electric vehicle. I’ve thought about getting one. And there’s some complications with electric vehicles that I think we’re going to get into and that BMW has certainly considered as they move down this path towards decarbonization. And they are sort of a bit of an outlier in terms of their competitors in this space. So I think it’s going to be really interesting for people to hear you talk about that. So thanks for writing the case and thanks for being here to talk about it. Why don’t we just get started right away here. If you want to begin by telling us what the central issue is in the case and what your question is to start the conversation in the classroom.

SHIRLEY LU: Absolutely. I see this case as a decarbonization 101 case for the students, where they learn the basics of carbon accounting, carbon management, but also strategies that today a lot of companies are facing this transition to a low carbon economy. So, I go in the classroom and start by saying that one of those industries is the automobile industry that is facing tremendous amount of pressure coming from regulators, investors. And they’re really focusing on this transition from internal combustion engines. I’ll call that ICE, to electrical vehicles, EVs, which really focuses on the tailpipe emissions. And so, our question for the student and the cold call is: why is BMW focusing on emissions across the entire value chain? So that will start from the supply chain to their own production and then to the use phase tailpipe emissions.

BRIAN KENNY: Now, I teased a little bit in the introduction about your areas of research. We always are interested in what motivates faculty to drill into a particular topic. I’m wondering why you decided to write this case.

SHIRLEY LU: Yes. First of all, I want to highlight this is also a joint work with two other amazing professors here, George Serafeim and Mike Toffel. And they were both kind of experts in decarbonization and thus great research there. So I definitely learned a lot from this process. And this is my first case. So, my hope is both to learn the art of case writing, but also that to do research in a climate space, I think the practice is moving very fast. So for example, the best practices, the challenges. In particular, I’m curious about the credibility of environmental disclosure. All of these are better learned in practice as opposed to having a lot of archival data. And so that’s why for me it’s really important to early on in the career to see how companies are actually doing these carbon accounting and management.

BRIAN KENNY: This is a pretty ambitious one and Mike and George are great. They’ve both been on the show and this is as good a time as any for me to plug Mike’s podcast Climate Rising, Mike Toffel is the host of that, cases like this are the kinds of conversations that he’s having with leaders in this field all the time. So, that’s awesome. Let’s talk about BMW. Everybody knows BMW. They make really nice expensive fast cars. You don’t necessarily think about them as a maker of EVs per se. You think about that stick shift on the floor and the sort of racing vibe that you get. Can you talk a little bit about their history as an automotive maker and the culture within the company?

SHIRLEY LU: BMW was founded in 1916 in Munich, Germany. And initially they actually produced aircraft engines and gradually moving to automobile engines and then automobile cars. And I think they’re best known for being the ultimate driving machine by having really strong engines.

BRIAN KENNY It’s great marketing right there, the ultimate driving machine.

SHIRLEY LU: And hence that transition to EV will be interesting. And two things I want to highlight about that culture when we visited a company. The first one that really comes off a lot when we talked to the employees there is this belief of under promise and over deliver. And so whenever they make a promise, they’ll make sure they deliver it, and if not, they’d rather not make the promise. And for example, when you look at EV, they talk about their driving range. So, when BMW releases a driving range and then someone independent goes in and test it, it’s actually probably longer than the one they listed. Whereas the other companies, it may be the opposite.

BRIAN KENNY: That’s pretty smart actually on their part, I think.

SHIRLEY LU: And then the second part about their culture is they’re very metric target driven, very quantitative. So, they set clear targets. And what’s interesting is everyone in the company owns a bit of that target. What we see is everyone knows the overarching target. So, down to every engineer, when they designed one component for the car, they have a part of that target. So, when I meant target, I mean the decarbonization target. They focused on sustainability starting way back in 1970s, but that’s when they first hire an environmental officer for the purpose of complying with environmental regulations. And then in 2000 is when they defined sustainability as part of their overarching strategy. And starting in 2007, that’s when they started developing the first battery electrical vehicle inside of the company. And that’s a time when there’s no mass produced BEV on the market, before the times of Tesla. And then in 2013 is when they release that EV, which is I3 model. And what’s fascinating is they try to have a EV that has the lowest emissions across the entire value chain, that even the door, they say if you compost a door, you put it on the ground, it will be composted.

BRIAN KENNY: I’ve seen the I3 and the I4, and some of them are a complete departure from what you would expect to see from BMW. So I’m wondering when they introduced these models, how were they viewed? How were they received by people?

SHIRLEY LU: It is quite divided. So, there are some that find it very revolutionary. It’s very different from their traditional cars. It’s very beautiful. To me, it looks a little cute even.

BRIAN KENNY: Right.

SHIRLEY LU: But on the other hand, you also have some critics saying that the market’s simply not ready. And they say it’s because they came up with an I3 so early in the game that’s why right now they’re a laggard in the EV game.

BRIAN KENNY: Okay. And who else are they competing with in this space? Who else is introducing models like this?

SHIRLEY LU: There are two types of players. First of all, you have the newer startups type company like Tesla and like XPeng or NIO in China that are all producing only electrical vehicles. But at the same time, a lot of the traditional automobile companies like Mercedes, like Ford, GM, they’re also facing this transition and pushing out their version of BEVs, battery electrical vehicles.

BRIAN KENNY: So, several of their competitors have already put a stake in the ground about when they’re planning to go completely cut away from ICE vehicles and go completely electric. Is that right?

SHIRLEY LU: Yes. For example, Mercedes say they will be ready to go all electric at the end of the decade where market conditions allow. And also at COP26, a lot of companies including Ford, Mercedes, General Motors, they signed a declaration to essentially ban ICE by 2040. And that’s no later than 2035 in the leading markets.

BRIAN KENNY: But BMW has not put that stake in the ground.

SHIRLEY LU: Exactly. So BMW is not making that statement, and instead they’re focusing on having a flexible powertrain strategy. So, by that, it means if you’re a customer and you want a particular type of car, you should be able to choose having an electrical battery inside or an internal combustion engine inside. So, you should leave that option to customers. And part of that reason is customers have different driving habits. So, some may be using a car for professional reasons, some may be using for leisure, for commute, some may in rural, some maybe in urban areas. And there’s this concern from the customer that the battery power cannot last for such a high range. And they call that a range anxiety, as one potential-

BRIAN KENNY: I have range anxiety. That’s one of the reasons why I haven’t made the move to the electric vehicle.

SHIRLEY LU: Exactly. And also the lack of charging infrastructure that when you go into oil station, you can just charge quite instantly. For EV, you have to charge for half an hour at the moment, the current technology. So, it’s adding that pressure. But what’s interesting here is in reality, the average driving distance is not that long for a trip. In the US for example, the average daily driving is less than 30 miles, but an EV’s range can go up to 300 miles.

BRIAN KENNY: Right. So, you’re saying that my anxiety is unwarranted as most people’s anxiety is probably unwarranted.

SHIRLEY LU: But again, it depends on the use case.

BRIAN KENNY: Yeah, yeah. And I would imagine that this strategy that they have pursued, I mean it makes sense to the extent that they’re able to meet the needs of the customer regardless of whether they’re looking for an electric vehicle or a combustion vehicle. But it’s got to be taxing on them as an organization because now they have two manufacturing processes, they have two sets of suppliers. It’s got to be complicated. So I can imagine that Mercedes and the other firms that have put this stake in the ground are saying, We’re converting everything because it’s just going to be a more fluid process for us.

SHIRLEY LU: Part of the reason for staying flexible, I think also relates to their experience with two other major trends in the automobile industry. So, you may have heard the three major trends are automation, ride sharing, and electrification. And with the first two, BMW invested in technology that relates to ride sharing and automation driving. The technology of the market is not quite there yet and end up they have to write off these investments. And so when it comes to the electrification, they’re also being very careful with the timing that they’ll keep it flexible. And again, relating back to their culture of not trying to overpromise. So that’s why I think partly they’re not going to give a date by which we’re going to ban internal combustion engine before they’re certain they can do that.

BRIAN KENNY: So, what’s the regulatory environment look like around EVs?

SHIRLEY LU: There is a lot of regulations coming out, and I think they’re the catalyst for this transition from internal combustion engine to EVs. For example, the EU parliament approved the ban of selling new ICE, new combustion engine by 2035.

BRIAN KENNY: Okay.

SHIRLEY LU: California also announced similar rules and other states like Massachusetts and New York are considering following. So the regulatory environment, I think it’s another big push. That’s why a lot of companies are also using those dates. 2035. That’s when we are going to also ban ICE.

BRIAN KENNY: Okay. So that puts a lot of pressure on BMW to put a date out there to put a stake in the ground. Are they suffering any consequences from not actually taking that step?

SHIRLEY LU: Yes and no. So, on the yes side, there are media articles that are calling them the EV laggard. And there’s even a social impact investor that comes out and say they are the Blackberry of the automobile industry. But on the other hand, potentially no. Because the more sophisticated analysts or investors may be able to see that BMW is still investing a lot in the EV technology. And even if you look at their actual sales of EV, it is higher than some of their traditional competitors.

BRIAN KENNY: And for those who remember Blackberries, by the way, they were really good, and they’re making a comeback. I think people are…

SHIRLEY LU: Really?

BRIAN KENNY: Yeah. Yeah. They’re pining for those again. Those and flip phones, who knew? Let’s talk about what exactly they’re measuring and reporting on within the EV cars themselves. And I think that begins with the GHG, the greenhouse gas protocol. Can you just describe as succinctly as possible, because I know it’s a very complicated measure, what exactly are they looking at with GHG?

SHIRLEY LU: Yes. And that’s what we hope the students can learn from that. The current way they measure carbon is through the greenhouse gas protocol and they divide greenhouse gases into three buckets. And first of all, there’s more than one greenhouse gas. They will aggregate everything in terms of a carbon equivalent in terms of the global warming potentials. So let’s call that carbon for now, carbon equivalent. So they separate those into three buckets. Scope one, two, and three. Scope one is the company’s direct emissions. So, for example, BMW burns certain fossil fuel for their paint shop. And so, that’ll be scope one direct emissions. Scope two is the electricity they purchase, and that has some emissions associated with that. Scope three is everything else. So for BMW, scope one and two is in total only 1% of their total emissions. Scope three, everything else can be separated into the supply chain and the use phase. Supply chain is around 15%, whereas the use phase is 80% of emissions.

BRIAN KENNY: Okay. And is that the use of the actual customer in the vehicle itself?

SHIRLEY LU: The use phase, exactly. That will be when the customers drive the car. And then the tailpipe emissions, that’s also being considered on BMW’s books.

BRIAN KENNY: Where are they focusing their decarbonization efforts? What are they looking at?

SHIRLEY LU: And that is back to our cold call question. Yeah, they look at the full value chain. So they set a science-based target, which are targets that can align with the scenario to limit the global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees. And so for them, the target is by 2030, per car, the scope one and two emissions, they want to reduce it by 80%. So that is quite ambitious. And part of the reason is, this is their own emissions. They need to own it, and really show they’re making a sincere effort. Scope three supply chain is 22% reduction. But in reality, to achieve that, it’s much harder. The reason is by converting to electrical vehicle, you’re having the battery. The battery increases your supply chain emissions by around 50%. So in total, for them, a true reduction of 22% really feels like a 70% reduction. And finally, scope three use phase, which is the driving. And that’s more depends on the car they sell that one they hope to reduce by 50%.

BRIAN KENNY: So, they are putting targets against all of these. And as you said, they’re ambitious targets, which flies a little bit in the face of their under-promise and over-deliver strategy. But what are some of the issues that they’ve run into as they try to make these goals?

SHIRLEY LU: Exactly. I think initially when they first set the targets, they are quite reasonable. And there will be surprises they learn afterwards that made it harder to achieve potentially. And I think it’s not unique to BMW. A lot of companies, they set a target, but how to achieve it? It’s a learning process. In the case of BMW. Let me share three surprises they had-

BRIAN KENNY: Okay.

SHIRLEY LU: … that are challenges. The first one is realizing a lot of the decarbonization opportunities are not readily available everywhere. So when they think about changing to solar and wind power, but not all the plants have the same amount of sunlight or wind. And so, when they plant at a high level and then realizing at the local level, it is not fully available. The second is some of the processes turn out to be more expensive. So, for example, electrification is a major step towards decarbonization because if you electrify all of your process, you don’t need to burn fossil fuel anymore. So that lowers emission, and then you can then move into using renewable energy to really transition to closer to almost zero emissions. But for them, they realized that to electrify for example the paint shop, that will mean they have to stop the operation and really rebuild the facility. And that is more costly than they initially thought. Whereas if they build a new facility with the new technology and become electrified to begin with, that is actually cheaper and that’s what they’re going for as well.

BRIAN KENNY: Okay. So scopes one and two are somewhat within their control, but difficult nonetheless. Scope three is really hard because now they start to dive into the supply chain. How deep are they going into the supply chain?

SHIRLEY LU: Very deep. Ideally, it’s all of the supply chain.

BRIAN KENNY: Wow.

SHIRLEY LU: But then as you imagine some of them four or five tiers down their supply chain, how are they going to get the measurements? And that speaks to one issue in the carbon accounting for scope three supply chain, which is this issue of primary versus secondary data. Ideally you get primary data, which is the real number that contributes to the tire, to the steel that you acquired. But then, because they don’t have such detailed information right now, they will use industry averages. So for example, steel produced in this region under this method as an average emissions of this number. And that’s what they’ll use on their books. And you can imagine the problem with this is, well then you are not compensating for firms that are greener.

BRIAN KENNY: The case goes into the Catena-X approach. How does that help them in this focus on phase three?

SHIRLEY LU: This is an industry effort that they are one of the pioneers in it. The idea is to build almost something like a blockchain for emissions data, where within the automobile industry, all of the suppliers will put their information on that chain. And Catena-X, actually the “Catena” stands for chain in Greek. And so, it’s the idea that if they all put in their data, then they can have this primary data. But you can imagine the challenge, it’s also how do you coordinate with everyone in the industry?

BRIAN KENNY: There’s also a big emphasis on recycling within the automotive space. The case goes into some of the complications of using recycled batteries in just recycled materials in general. Can you talk a little bit about that?

SHIRLEY LU: And that’s actually the third surprise that I wanted to mention earlier with recycling. The surprises with recycling is that it’s difficult to have a closed loop. So some of the materials like aluminum, you need a higher quality for automobile industry, you need higher purity, let’s say purity. Whereas for Coca-Cola can you also need aluminum, but that’s of a lower quality. And the issue is some of the cars being recycled, the aluminum were used to produce Coca-Cola cans. So, you actually lose that same purity of aluminum, which are not going back into the automobile industry. So, these are some of the issues, how can you get back the material? So the same with battery. The battery is even more important to have recycling because of the rare minerals that is of limited supply. And so, who can really keep the battery to their own company, to their own production can really dominate the market. And one thing they mentioned that’s interesting is in China, the requirement is that whoever produces the battery, the company, so if BMW sells a car with a battery, BMW has to recycle that battery. Whereas in the rest of the world, there’s no such a regulation. So the question becomes who gets those recycled batteries?

BRIAN KENNY: I was really surprised to read in the case that there are ICE vehicles in the BMW line that have lower emissions than some of their EVs, which made me say, “Well, why are they doing this at all?” Because that throws up a big red flag. But maybe you can talk a little bit about why an ICE vehicle would have lower emissions than a smaller size EV.

SHIRLEY LU: And that really depends on a few factors.

BRIAN KENNY: Okay.

SHIRLEY LU: That is actually one of the major exercises we have the students do in class. We share an Excel file with them with all the emissions numbers and ask them to tweak certain assumptions. And in particular, we ask them to tweak where the battery’s being produced, what is the local grids emissions and how long do you drive the car for? And these factors, let me highlight two key things here. So, the first one is the transition from ICE to EV is a trade-off where you lower your tailpipe emissions, but you increase the emissions from the battery. So, with ICE, you are kind of creating emissions as you drive. With the electrical vehicles, you don’t see the emissions, but you charge them using the local electricity. So, the emissions of your local electricity will determine how much emissions that process creates.

BRIAN KENNY: Very interesting.

SHIRLEY LU: And that really varies by region. So the emissions of the local grid in China, for example, is three times that of EU and twice as much as in the US. And so, in certain combinations where you don’t drive long distances, you are in a local grid with very high emissions and battery produced in regions with high emissions, there is that potential that the EV is actually dirtier than an internal combustion engine. And the other question we also ask students is, what about outside of the model? Are there some things we’re not capturing just by looking at one car scenario? And one factor is, imagine if all the cars convert to EV, let’s say right now, there’s not enough renewable energy or clean energy such that you may need to actually end up firing up more coal plants and that is higher emissions.

BRIAN KENNY: Yeah. This is part of it, the whole tension around sustainability. And we talk about this in other cases that we discuss on the show as well. This has been a really interesting conversation, Shirley. If there’s one thing you want listeners to remember about the BMW case, what would it be?

SHIRLEY LU: The measurement. You need to measure emissions because you can’t manage what you don’t measure. And with the better measurements, it helps you make better decisions. And one thing we want to highlight is emissions across the entire value chain. Sometimes by focusing on one type of emission, you end up increasing another emission. So it’s important to see the full picture. And one final thing, what I really am grateful for, is BMW for sharing with us all of their experience. And our hope, or my hope, is that some of the students who learn this will one day go into their own company and this case can show them once you have the measures, you can start making better decisions.

Sustainability through Innovation.

Continuously enhancing driving pleasure and ambitious sustainability targets define the work of the BMW Group in shaping the individual mobility of the future. The company firmly believes that innovation is the key to progress in both areas. With more than 100 years of experience and extensive technological expertise, the BMW Group is rising to the challenge of developing attractive mobility solutions in harmony with climate protection, resource conservation, quality of life in urban environments and social responsibility. As part of the “Sustainability through Innovation 2022” event, the company is presenting a wide range of groundbreaking technologies, concepts and strategies that illustrate how innovative strength and visionary thinking can generate momentum for sustainable mobility.

New battery cell for the NEUE KLASSE models.

With the models of the NEUE KLASSE due to make their début in 2025, the BMW Group is poised to enter a new era in electromobility and for the first time use round battery cells, which are optimally adapted to the new architecture centred around all-electric drive systems. The innovative lithium-ion batteries for what will be the sixth generation of BMW eDrive technology will increase range by 30 percent and charging speed by around 20 percent. There will also be a reduction in CO 2 emissions in the production of the battery cells, while manufacturing costs for the entire high-voltage battery will be up to 50 percent lower compared with the current, fifth generation.

The new round cells measure 46 millimetres in diameter and will be manufactured in two different lengths. Depending on the model, they can be flexibly integrated into the available installation space in the vehicle underbody. To meet demand for battery cells for the NEUE KLASSE, the BMW Group will build two new battery cell factories with partners in Europe, China and the USMCA region.

BMW EfficientDynamics supports the transformation to electromobility.

More driving pleasure, lower emissions – this is the principle behind BMW EfficientDynamics, which has been driving progress in sustainability through continuous innovation since 2007. Along with the drive system, the technology package includes intelligent lightweight construction, reduced rolling resistance and optimised aerodynamics, all of which play a part in the transformation to electromobility. Current BMW models featuring pure electric drivetrains have been impressing media representatives in test drives, delivering outstanding energy consumption and range values and even undercutting or exceeding the official WLTP or EPA figures in some cases.

The NEUE KLASSE models will also benefit from BMW EfficientDynamics. This integrated approach to maximum efficiency influences development of the new vehicles and platforms from the very outset, not just in the drivetrain configuration, but also in the areas of design and material selection.

On the road to a circular economy and vegan interiors.

At the BMW Group, designers, material scientists and experts from other disciplines are working together on sustainable solutions for designing vehicle interiors and exteriors. The focus is on responsible procurement and processing of raw materials that is as CO 2 -free as possible, continuously increasing the proportion of secondary materials with the aim of achieving a complete circular economy, new recycling processes, increased use of natural fibres and the replacement of raw materials of animal origin.

The BMW Group plans to launch its first vehicles featuring completely vegan interiors in 2023. This is being made possible primarily through the development of innovative materials with leather-like properties. Replacing leather reduces the CO 2 emissions along the value chain for the respective interior components by around 85 percent.

Recycled fishing nets as a raw material for interior and exterior components.

In a first for the automotive industry, the models of the NEUE KLASSE due to be launched from 2025 onwards will feature trim parts made of plastic whose raw material contains around 30 percent recycled fishing nets and ropes. These waste materials from the maritime industry are proactively sourced at ports all around the world to ensure that they don’t end up being discarded in the sea. For numerous other materials – from steel and aluminium to plastic and glass, all the way to high-voltage batteries – new recycling processes are being developed and established in line with the principles of a circular economy. Through its work in the area of circular design, the BMW Group aims to ensure that end-of-life vehicles are available for use as a source of raw materials for new vehicles.

Sustainable materials, new aesthetic: Visionary seat design concepts.

The BMW Group is also presenting visionary seat design concepts for future BMW and MINI models at the event. The materials used are characterised by environmentally friendly manufacturing processes, full recyclability, groundbreaking aesthetics and uncompromising premium quality with an exceptional look and feel.

Digital tools for greater sustainability.

Digitalisation and the associated innovations are also making a significant contribution to continuously increasing sustainability in the supply chain and in the construction of BMW Group vehicles. This is evident in the cross-industry data network Catena-X and in generative design with new computer-assisted methods for the development of vehicle components.

BMW AG is one of the initiators of the Catena-X partner network, which, through the establishment of a networked database, is also laying the groundwork for the creation a circular economy and the consistent reduction of CO 2 emissions in the supply chain. Around a year after its launch, the alliance for the secure exchange of data across companies in the automotive industry is now presenting its first applications ready for testing in practice.

Breakthrough in the NEUE KLASSE: Generative design.

Within the BMW Group, digitalisation in the form of generative design is playing an increasingly important role in the efficient and resource-saving design of vehicle components. Using computer algorithms, designers and engineers can create complex component geometries that enable a significant reduction in material usage and weight that would not be possible with conventional methods.

Diverse concepts for sustainable urban mobility.

To increase sustainability in the use phase of its vehicles and at the same time promote the attractiveness of cities as living spaces for their residents, the BMW Group is examining the entire urban mobility ecosystem. In addition to the development of locally emission-free vehicles, this includes diverse concepts for sustainable mobility in urban areas.

Innovative round battery cells for NEUE KLASSE from 2025.

More performance, CO2-reduced production, significantly lower costs: BMW Group to use innovative round BMW battery cells in NEUE KLASSE from 2025.

The BMW Group is convinced that powerful, innovative, sustainably-produced battery cells will be key to the success of individual electromobility in the future. The company is set to launch a new era of e-mobility from 2025 with the models of its NEUE KLASSE – using newly-developed round battery cells optimised for the new architecture for the first time.

“The newly-developed sixth generation of our lithium-ion cells will bring a huge leap in technology that will increase energy density by more than 20 percent, improve charging speed by up to 30 percent and enhance range by up to 30 percent,” according to Frank Weber, member of the Board of Management of BMW AG responsible for Development. “We are also reducing CO 2 emissions from cell production by up to 60 percent. These are big steps for sustainability and customer benefits.”

“To meet our long-term needs, we will be building battery cell factories with our partners, each with an annual capacity of up to 20 GWh, at six locations in key markets for us: two in China, two in Europe and two in USMCA,” added Joachim Post, member of the Board of Management of BMW AG responsible for Purchasing and Supplier Network. “We have also reached agreement with our partners that they will use a percentage of secondary material for the raw materials lithium, cobalt and nickel, as well as utilising green power for production, to ensure CO 2 -reduced manufacturing.”

The BMW Group has already awarded contracts in the two-digit billion-euro range for production of the new BMW battery cells. By leveraging the comprehensive in-house expertise of the company’s own Battery Cell Competence Centre, the team from development, production and purchasing has been able to significantly reduce costs for the high-voltage battery, thanks to the new battery cell and new integration concept for battery technology developed by BMW.Based on current market assumptions, costs can be reduced by up to 50 percent, compared to the current fifth generation. The BMW Group has set itself the goal of bringing manufacturing costs for fully-electric models down to the same level as vehicles with state-of-the-art combustion-engine technology.

Technological advances: new cell format and enhanced cell chemistry

The battery cell is responsible for electric vehicles’ core properties of range, driving performance and charging time. For the sixth generation of BMW eDrive technology used in the NEUE KLASSE, the company has fundamentally refined the cell format and cell chemistry. With the new BMW round cell specially designed for the electric architecture of the NEUE KLASSE models, it will be possible to significantly increase the range of the highest-range model by up to 30 percent (according to WLTP).

The new BMW round cells come with a standard diameter of 46 millimetres and two different heights. Compared to the prismatic cells of the fifth BMW battery cell generation, the nickel content in the sixth-generation BMW round cells is higher on the cathode side, while the cobalt content is reduced. On the anode side, the silicon content will be increased. As a result, the cell’s volumetric energy density will improve by more than 20 percent.

The battery system plays a key role in the body structure of the NEUE KLASSE. Depending on the model, it can be flexibly integrated into the installation space to save space (“pack to open body”). The cell module level is thus eliminated.

The battery, drive train and charging technology in the NEUE KLASSE will also have a higher voltage of 800 volts. Among other things, this will optimise how energy is supplied to direct current high-power charging stations, which can achieve a much higher charging capacity with a current of up to 500 amperes – thus reducing the time it takes to charge the vehicle from 10 to 80 percent by up to 30 percent.

Battery cell factories in China, Europe and USMCA – each with total capacity of up to 20 GWh per year

To supply the battery cells needed for the NEUE KLASSE, the BMW Group has already awarded contracts in the two-digit billion-euro range for construction of battery cell factories to CATL and EVE Energy. Both partners will build two gigafactories in China and Europe. Each of the battery cell factories will have a total annual capacity of up to 20 GWh. Plans call for two more battery cell factories to be built in the North American free trade zone,

USMCA, for which the partners have not yet been nominated.

The three regions where the battery cell factories will be built will also benefit economically from the creation of new supply chains, new networks for subcontractors and new jobs.

CO 2 -reduced production using green power and secondary material

The BMW Group is particularly focused on keeping the carbon footprint and consumption of resources for production as low as possible, starting in the supply chain. Cell manufacturers will use cobalt, lithium and nickel that include a percentage of secondary material, i.e. raw materials that are not newly mined, but already in the loop, in production of battery cells. Combined with the commitment to use only green power from renewable energies for production of battery cells, the BMW Group will reduce the carbon footprint of battery cell production by up to 60 percent, compared to the current generation of battery cells.

Reuse of raw materials will be one of the success factors for e-mobility in the future. Circular loops reduce the need for new raw materials, lower the risk of infringing environmental and social standards in the supply chain and generally result in significantly lower CO 2 emissions. That is why the long-term goal of the BMW Group is to use fully recyclable battery cells. In China, the company is currently creating a closed loop for reuse of the raw materials nickel, lithium and cobalt from high-voltage batteries, thus laying the cornerstone of a ground-breaking material cycle.

The cobalt and lithium used as raw materials for the new generation of BMW battery cells will be sourced from certified mines. This means the company retains full transparency over extraction methods and, in this way, can ensure responsible mining. The sourcing of both raw materials from certified mines takes place either directly through the BMW Group or via the battery cell manufacturer.

The BMW Group has been actively involved for many years in initiatives to develop standards for responsible raw material extraction and promote compliance with environmental and social standards for raw material extraction through certification of mines. In this way, the company is also making itself less technologically, geographically and geopolitically dependent on individual resources and suppliers.

Development of future BMW battery cells at in-house competence centres

The BMW Group is constantly working to further develop energy storage systems. For instance, its sixth-generation battery technology also offers the option of using cathodes made of lithium iron phosphate (LFP) for the first time. This means the critical raw materials cobalt and nickel can then be avoided entirely in the cathode material. In parallel, the BMW Group is also pushing forward with development of all-solid-state batteries (ASSBs). The company aims to have high-voltage batteries of this type ready for series introduction by the end of the decade. The BMW Group will present a demonstrator vehicle with this technology on board well before 2025.

The BMW Group has been systematically building expertise in the field of battery cell technology since 2008. Since 2019, this know-how has been concentrated at the BMW Group’s Battery Cell Competence Centre (BCCC) in Munich. The BCCC spans the entire value chain – from research and development to battery cell design to manufacturability.

To ensure innovations in battery cell technology are put into practice quickly and efficiently, the BMW Group relies on a network of around 300 partners, with cooperation between established companies, startups and colleges, among others.

The knowledge gained in this way will be validated at the new Cell Manufacturing Competence Centre (CMCC) in Parsdorf, near Munich, which will begin commissioning near-standard production of samples in late 2022 for the future BMW battery cell generation to be used in the NEUE KLASSE from 2025 onwards.

The pilot line at the competence centre will make it possible to analyse and fully understand the cell production process under near-standard conditions. This will help enable future suppliers produce cells to specifications and according to their own expertise – thus further optimising battery cell production with regard to quality, output and costs.

NEUE KLASSE will make major contribution to sales volumes

With a fast-growing product lineup and high demand, the BMW Group aims to have more than two million fully-electric vehicles on the roads by the end of 2025.

The all-electric NEUE KLASSE will make a significant contribution to BMW Group sales volumes from mid-decade. The NEUE KLASSE has the potential to further accelerate the market penetration of e-mobility: This means 50 percent of the BMW Group’s global sales could already come from fully-electric vehicles before 2030.

The MINI brand will have an exclusively all-electric product range by the early 2030s, while Rolls-Royce will also be an all-electric brand from 2030. All future new models from BMW Motorrad in the field of urban mobility will likewise be fully electric.

BMW Efficient Dynamics.

A new dimension in tangible efficiency.

With the introduction of its EfficientDynamics technology package back in 2007, the BMW Group presented a concept that remains unrivalled in the automotive industry to this day. It centred on consistently reducing fuel consumption – and thereby CO 2 emissions – on the one hand, while steadily increasing driving pleasure on the other.

With BMW EfficientDynamics, every aspect of vehicle development is measured in terms of how it can contribute to optimising sustainability. In addition to all aspects of the drive system, it applies to energy and heat management, aerodynamics, optimisation of rolling resistance and weight reduction through intelligent lightweight construction.

With this continuously evolving technology package, the company succeeded in reducing the CO 2 emissions of its brands’ vehicle fleets by 53 percent between 1995 and 2020. The BMW Group has now set itself the target of cutting CO 2 emissions per kilometre driven for its vehicles in the use phase by a further 50 percent by 2030.

The company’s meticulous efforts are now paying off, especially in the transformation to electric drivetrains.

“The real ranges that the BMW i4 and BMW iX achieve compared to their rivals show that while others focus on brochure values, BMW delivers. This clearly demonstrates the effectiveness of our EfficientDynamics strategy: maximum efficiency that is tangible for our customers,” says Frank Weber, Member of the Board of Management, Development.

When determining the range and energy consumption values for the models in its electric fleet, the BMW Group focuses on realistic, customer-representative vehicle configurations and achieves impressive values through maximum efficiency.

By consistently focusing on the customer, the BMW Group – unlike many of its competitors – designs its vehicles for ranges that correspond to real-world use cases as opposed to just looking good on paper. This is also confirmed in independent tests conducted with the BMW i4 and BMW iX under real conditions by various trade publications.

Battery electric vehicles from the BMW Group perform exceptionally well in long-term tests conducted by trade media, delivering impressive ranges that in some cases even exceed the official values determined in the WLTP test cycle. In the test conducted by US trade magazine Edmunds, the BMW iX xDrive50 exceeded the official EPA range estimate by almost 100 kilometres (energy consumption (combined): 21.1 – 20.7 kWh/100 km; CO 2 emissions (combined): 0 g/km according to WLTP; NEDC values: – ). It also set a new range record for electric vehicles in the Sports Activity Vehicle (SAV) segment tested by the magazine.

The BMW i4 M50 also performed well (energy consumption (combined): 22.5 – 18.0 kWh/100 km; CO 2 emissions (combined): 0 g/km according to WLTP; NEDC values: – ) on the Edmunds test track, delivering a real-world range that exceeded the EPA value by more than 65 kilometres.

Everyday consumption data from realistic use cases and test vehicle configurations.

When designing new vehicle models, the developers at the BMW Group focus on the actual usage behaviour of customers. These use cases include dynamic driving situations, long-distance journeys, driving in extreme temperatures and towing a trailer.

When it comes to reducing vehicle consumption, the BMW Group places a very high focus on optimizing additional vehicle options and equipment. This not only results in small spreads with different configurations of optional equipment. It also enables vehicles with customer-representative equipment (so-called “BestFit”) to stand out in the competitive environment with very good energy consumption

figures.

“Efficiency is the true achievement.”

Recent test reports in national and international publications confirm the effectiveness of this approach. Focus online magazine measured average energy consumption of 21.2 kWh per 100 kilometres for the BMW iX xDrive50 for urban, interurban and motorway driving with a dynamic driving style, 0.1 kWh below the official range measured in the WLTP test cycle. In its Ecotest, ADAC recorded average energy consumption of just 20.4 kWh per 100 kilometres. The range of 610 kilometres achieved by the testers also exceeded the maximum value from the WLTP test cycle. The independent experts attribute this primarily to the high efficiency of the electric motors and the intelligent energy management, which, among other things, enables adaptive recuperation: “The enormous range achieved by the BMW iX in the ADAC Ecotest is thanks to the efficiency of the drive system.”

The fact that the BMW iX xDrive50 manages the energy stored in its high-voltage battery so efficiently, even under demanding test conditions, also impressed the authors from UK consumer website Which?. They described it as “the only car we’ve tested since 2017 to deliver its official WLTP range” in practice. The highly integrated drive units, intelligent lightweight construction and optimised aerodynamics are decisive factors in this regard. As a result, the BMW iX xDrive50 has the lowest energy consumption of all vehicles in its segment that Which? has tested. The testers conclude: “Efficiency, not range, is BMW’s true achievement.”

The NEUE KLASSE will benefit from BMW EfficientDynamics.

The BMW EfficientDynamics strategy will continue to influence all aspects of new models in the future, optimising efficiency from the ground up during the use phase. This process begins in the early development stages for new vehicles or platforms such as the all-electric architecture of the NEUE KLASSE.

In addition to a new, highly efficient modular drive system from what will be the sixth generation of BMW eDrive technology, aerodynamics optimised for the battery platform will not only increase the efficiency of the NEUE KLASSE models, but also serve as an enabler for a distinctive new BMW design. Other important factors are the weight savings achieved through intelligent lightweight construction using new materials, an energy-efficient vehicle electrical system, a specific braking system for electric vehicles and the reduction of rolling resistance through improved wheel bearings, as well as close cooperation with tyre developers to achieve the best possible Class A+ tyres.

Circularity and materials.

Priority for secondary raw materials and natural fibres, BMW to offer vegan vehicle interiors for the first time in 2023.

What is a car made of? The BMW Group is finding innovative answers to this question through fundamental research, detailed development and a clear focus on sustainability. The emphasis is on raw materials that can be procured and processed as CO 2 -free as possible, continuously increasing the proportion of secondary materials with the aim of achieving a complete circular economy, new recycling processes, increased use of natural fibres and the replacement of raw materials of animal origin.

At IAA Mobility 2021, the BMW Group presented the BMW i Vision Circular, a look ahead to a car that is designed according to circular economy principles across the board and defines sustainability and luxury for the year 2040. Together, designers, material scientists and experts from other disciplines are looking to the long-term future, developing innovative ideas that combine sustainability with the highest functional quality and an inspiring new aesthetic. Along with the material properties, aspects such as raw material procurement and production methods are of essential importance in the design process.

On the market from 2023: BMW and MINI models with vegan interiors.

The BMW Group plans to launch its first vehicles featuring completely vegan interiors in 2023. This is being made possible primarily through the development of innovative materials with leather-like properties. It will also be possible to use these materials for steering wheel surfaces, which must fulfil demanding criteria when it comes to feel, premium appearance and wear resistance. Fully vegan interiors will be available for both BMW and MINI models for the first time from 2023. The BMW Group is thus serving the demand for vegan and leather-free interiors, which is set to increase further in the near future, especially in the US, China and Europe.

The reduction of CO 2 emissions over the entire life cycle of a vehicle is the central goal of the BMW Group on the road to climate neutrality, which is to be achieved by 2050 at the latest. Material selection has a key role to play in achieving this goal. Replacing raw materials of animal origin makes a significant contribution to increasing sustainability in vehicle production. The introduction of a new surface material for steering wheels will see the proportion of vehicle components that contain traces of raw materials of animal origin fall to less than one percent in the respective BMW and MINI vehicles. As a result, these materials will now only be found in areas that are not visible to the customer, for example in various waxy substances such as gelatine used in protective coatings, lanolin in paints, tallow as an additive in elastomers and beeswax as a flux for paints.

The BMW Group has for a long time been offering various fabric alternatives to leather. Now, for the first time, it is possible to offer a suitable substitute for leather for the most important interface between driver and vehicle. The steering wheel surfaces must fulfil demanding criteria when it comes to appearance, wear resistance and durability. “With a steering wheel made from a high-quality vegan surface material, we are fulfilling the wishes of our customers who do not want to make any compromises in terms of look, feel and functionality. The innovative material withstands wear and tear caused by abrasion, perspiration and moisture and has all the desirable properties of leather,” says Uwe Köhler, Head of Development Body, Exterior Trim, Interior at the BMW Group. The only distinguishing feature of the new material will be a new grain effect on the steering wheel rim.

Leather-free surfaces reduce CO 2 e emissions by 85 percent.

The fact that there is now a high-quality vegan surface material with equivalent properties to the real leather previously used in the production of steering wheels represents another major step towards CO 2 reduction. The new steering wheel surface material reduces CO 2 e emissions along the value chain by around 85 percent compared to leather. Up to now, most of the emissions produced, around 80 percent, were in the form of methane gas from cattle rearing. The remaining 20 percent was accounted for by processing of the cowhide, which is highly energy- and water-intensive.

Climate neutrality and a circular economy are the top priorities.

To achieve the goal of climate neutrality, the BMW Group is relying on the use of green electricity in production and in the supply chain, a consistently increased proportion of secondary materials and natural raw materials, highly efficient electric motors and combustion engines and a high recycling rate in line with the principles of a circular economy.

It’s all in the detail: The floor mats for various models are made from mono-material, thus avoiding material mixes that are difficult to recycle. As a result, the BMW Group saves around 23,000 tonnes of CO 2 and an additional 1,600 tonnes of waste every year, since the recycled floor mats and waste material are also reused within the production process.

Research and development in the field of secondary raw materials and sustainable materials are a top priority. Future vehicle generations will offer other attractive alternatives to leather. The BMW Group is working with start-up companies to develop innovative bio-based materials. Compared to the synthetic leathers previously used, these result in around 45 percent lower CO 2 emissions. MirumTM, which is 100 percent bio-based and petroleum-free, has the potential to mimic all the properties of traditional leather. Another new material, DeserttexTM, is made from pulverised cactus fibres with a bio-based polyurethane matrix. With these materials, replacing raw materials of animal origin can be combined with a significant reduction in CO 2 .

New materials, new aesthetic: Visionary seat design concepts.

With visionary seat concepts, BMW Group Design presents ideas for concrete applications using other innovative materials and production methods that contribute to lower CO 2 emissions and increased use of secondary materials, while at the same time establishing a new, high-quality interior aesthetic for the cars of the future. Two seat concepts each for vehicles from the MINI and BMW brands are featured.

Seat surfaces are a central element in the design of a vehicle interior and are of significant importance when it comes to the customer’s perception of the ambience. The design process therefore considers the look and feel, aesthetic impact and consistently high quality and tries to balance these aspects with resource-saving production and maximum recyclability of the material. Exciting colour combinations and surprising surface textures are ushering in a new lifestyle and luxury experience that is strongly influenced by an awareness of sustainability. In addition, efforts to conserve resources and reduce CO 2 emissions are driving innovation in the areas of design and material selection.

MINI is consistently focusing on vegan interiors for its next model generation. New materials and processing techniques make it possible to combine the premium character of the brand and its customers with significantly increased sustainability. With the So Soft seat concept, designers demonstrate how high-quality, colourful and comfortable a leather alternative can be. The velour used for the surfaces has a pleasant feel and offers exceptional comfort. The extremely durable material also comes in a wide range of colours, thus contributing to the interior personalisation options that MINI typically offers. Along with a significantly reduced carbon footprint, the development goal is complete recyclability of the material used. The raw material is recycled fibres, which are processed to create a mono-material for the entire seat surface and can therefore be recycled separately.

A mono-material that is fully recyclable is also used for the surfaces of the 3D Knit seat concept. A special manufacturing process also contributes to the sustainable character of the concept. The surface material is created using a resource-saving 3D knitting method that generates almost no production waste and is less time-consuming than conventional manufacturing processes. It is also produced in one piece, lending it a high-quality appearance with no seams. The fabric created using the 3D knitting method offers a high level of comfort and a particularly modern aesthetic.

With the seat concepts created for BMW cars, BMW Group Design presents several innovative materials used side by side, which can thus be analysed together and compared. The Infinite Loop seat concept is characterised by the consistent use of recycled material. Textile waste, which is processed into a synthetic yarn, is used to produce the material for the seat surfaces. This manufacturing process uses around 98 percent less water than when using cotton and reduces CO 2 emissions by around 80 percent compared to the conventional processing of polyester.

The solid backrest elements of the Infinite Loop seat concept can be made from leftover materials from the plastics industry or, as part of a complete circular economy, from the seating foam from end-of-life vehicles. In addition, composite materials made from dust and polystyrene waste can be used for resource-saving production of the seat backrests.

The Grown Innovation seat concept combines synthetic textiles made from 100 percent recycled material with natural fibres and a new type of biomaterial obtained from bacterial nanocellulose. The biomaterial, which is created in a laboratory process over the course of several weeks, forms the basis for a plastic-free, non-animal textile material with a high-quality surface finish and long service life. Another component of the surfaces developed for the Grown Innovation seat concept consists of a synthetic textile material produced using a 3D printing process. The additive manufacturing process does not generate any production waste and offers designers almost unlimited freedom when it comes to designing shapes and colours for vehicle interiors.

The upper section of the seat backrest – a possible alternative to the wood surfaces conventionally used in cars – consists of a composite material made from fast-growing plant fibres, which are characterised by a particularly favourable carbon footprint from cultivation to processing, and a protein-based binding agent. The material can be processed efficiently and in a variety of geometries and has a high-quality grain.

Renewable raw materials and natural fibres: Reduced weight, negative carbon footprint.

The BMW Group is already using renewable raw materials, natural fibres and other bio-based materials in its vehicles – for example in door trim panels or in the substructure of the centre armrest for the new BMW 7 Series. The use of natural raw materials such as hemp, kenaf and flax minimises the use of materials and reduces weight by up to 50 percent compared to conventional materials. Natural materials also come into the CO 2 calculation with a negative value, since the plants used can absorb CO 2 and release oxygen during the growth phase.

The BMW i3, launched in 2013, demonstrated how much the use of natural materials contributes to a holistic concept for sustainability along with electromobility, intelligent lightweight construction and the use of recycled raw materials. The natural, environmentally friendly materials used in its interior also meet the highest quality standards expected for a premium car in the long term. Based on this experience, the BMW Group continues to work on the development of other possible applications for natural materials and a wide range of uses in production vehicles. The door trim panels of the BMW i3 are made from kenaf fibres harvested from malva plants, which retain their distinctive natural structure when processed. Eucalyptus wood from certified plantations in Europe is used as the raw material for parts of the instrument panel. The leather in the interior of the BMW i3 is naturally tanned using an extract of olive leaves. The natural materials also contribute to the BMW i3’s excellent eco-balance, and their use in visible areas of the interior is a progressive design feature.

Components constructed from renewable plant fibres have also proven their worth in motorsport. Swiss cleantech company Bcomp produced a flax cooling shaft for the BMW iFE.20 driven in Formula E. Some carbon components in BMW M Motorsport touring cars are being replaced by reinforcement solutions made from natural fibre composites. BMW i Ventures, the venture capital firm of the BMW Group, has invested in Bcomp and agreed on a development collaboration.

Revolution in the car industry: Parts made from recycled fishing nets.

In a first for the automotive industry, the models of the New Class due to be launched from 2025 onwards will feature trim parts made of plastic whose raw material contains around 30 percent recycled fishing nets and ropes. This raw material is proactively sourced at ports all around the world to ensure that it doesn’t end up being discarded in the sea.

In an exclusive recycling process, waste material from the maritime industry is used to produce trim parts suitable for the exterior and interior of future vehicles. The resulting components have an approximately 25 percent lower carbon footprint than their counterparts made from conventionally manufactured plastics.

Conserving resources, reducing the carbon footprint, avoiding ocean pollution.

The BMW Group is working with different approaches to use plastic waste from the maritime industry as a raw material for vehicle components in order to conserve valuable resources and reduce CO 2 emissions. This form of recycling makes it possible to reduce the need for petroleum-based primary plastics and at the same time counteract ocean pollution.

Recycled nylon waste forms the basis for a synthetic yarn from which the floor mats in the BMW iX and the new BMW X1, for example, are made. This material, known as ECONYL, is made from fishing nets recovered from the ocean as well as worn floor coverings and residual waste from plastics production.

Only at the BMW Group: Maritime plastic waste used to produce visible trim parts.

In a new initiative, the BMW Group is taking the recycling of maritime plastic waste a step further. After separation, fishing nets and ropes undergo an innovative process that produces plastic granules. While recycled maritime plastic has so far only been used in the automotive industry in the form of fibres for new vehicle components, this recycled material is now also suitable for the injection moulding process for the first time. The raw material for the components manufactured in this way can consist of around 30 percent maritime plastic waste.

This creates additional application possibilities for recycled plastics. The components manufactured using the injection moulding process are trim parts that will be used in both non-visible and visible areas of the exterior and interior of the New Class models from 2025. Overall, the BMW Group has set itself the target of increasing the proportion of secondary materials in the thermoplastics used in new vehicles from currently around 20 percent to an average of 40 percent by 2030.

Design as a starting point for CO 2 reduction and circularity.

The BMW Group currently manufactures its vehicles using almost 30 percent recycled and reusable materials. The “secondary first” approach aims to gradually increase this figure to 50 percent. In this context, it is crucial that the quality, safety and reliability of the materials comply with the same high standards as those existing for primary materials. The BMW Group takes a holistic view of sustainability and evaluates the carbon footprint of each individual material used in the interior and exterior.

The BMW i Vision Circular shows how a car can be designed with a consistent focus on the principles of the circular economy. It clearly illustrates how resource conservation begins with vehicle design. The overriding design aim for this Vision Vehicle was to optimise it for closed-loop material cycles. This involves consistently reducing the number of components, material groups and surface finishes. In addition to bio-based raw materials, the BMW i Vision Circular primarily uses materials that have already gone through a product life cycle and are 100 percent recyclable.

Closed-loop recycling: The vehicle as a source of raw materials.

Circular design aims to ensure that end-of-life vehicles are available for use as a source of raw materials for new vehicles. Recyclability is optimised primarily through a reduced variety of materials. The use of mono-materials contributes significantly to simplified recycling and improved purity of secondary raw materials. This applies to textiles as well as to plastics and metal alloys.

The BMW Group has been a pioneer in the field of vehicle dismantling and recycling processes for around two decades. The company is committed to establishing a circular economy within the automotive industry, especially for steel, aluminium, glass and plastics, and is working on concepts for automated sorting of raw materials and efficient dismantling processes. In a pilot project with chemical company BASF and recycling and environmental services provider ALBA, the BMW Group is exploring possible conditions and recycling technologies for the establishment of a material cycle for plastics that would enable an end to the use of crude oil as a raw material.

A circular economy for vehicle windows is also to be created by 2030. Consistent dismantling, sorting and reuse of automotive glass could reduce CO 2 emissions in window production by up to 30 percent compared to using new material.

Plastics: Increased use of recycled materials and bio-based raw materials.

New BMW and MINI vehicles contain around 300 kilogrammes of plastic. Around 95 percent of these plastics come from components that are sourced from suppliers and assembled at BMW Group plants.

Depending on the model, recycled material currently accounts for up to 20 percent of the thermoplastics used in a new vehicle. The BMW Group has set itself the target of increasing the proportion of recycled material to an average of 40 percent by 2030. Some plastic components are already made from 100 percent secondary material. The increased use of secondary raw materials not only leads directly to the conservation of resources, but also makes a significant contribution to reducing CO 2 emissions in the supply chain. Switching from primary to secondary materials reduces CO 2 emissions in the manufacture of thermoplastic components by 50 to 80 percent. Another way to reduce the carbon footprint in the supply chain is to use bio-based plastics and plastics reinforced with natural fibres such as cellulose, hemp, wood or bamboo.

Steel and aluminium: Low-CO 2 production, increased use of secondary raw materials.

For the manufacture of steel and aluminium components, the aim is to continuously reduce CO 2 emissions in the production of materials and make greater use of secondary materials. From 2025 onwards, the BMW Group will source steel from a Swedish manufacturer that uses hydrogen and electricity from renewable sources for production. Agreement has also been reached with another supplier for the procurement of steel from CO 2 -reduced production, which means that from 2025, more than 40 percent of requirements for vehicle production at the European BMW Group plants can be covered in this way. As a result, CO 2 emissions can be reduced by around 400,000 tonnes annually. CO 2 -reduced production processes are also being agreed with steel suppliers in the US and China.

At the same time, the proportion of secondary raw materials in steel components is to be gradually increased from the current average of around 25 percent. Depending on the alloy, between 50 and 80 percent of the CO 2 emissions in the production process could be avoided in this way.

The BMW Group has been sourcing aluminium produced using electricity generated from solar energy since February 2021. The light metal produced with the help of solar power comes from the United Arab Emirates. A long-term increase in deliveries of aluminium produced using green electricity is planned, with the aim of reducing CO 2 emissions in this area by a total of around 2.5 million tonnes by 2030. From 2024 onwards, all cast aluminium wheels sourced by the BMW Group will be produced using only green electricity. Regeneratively generated energy is used both in the energy-intensive electrolysis when producing aluminium and when casting the wheels.

Some aluminium components already contain up to 50 percent secondary raw materials, with the figure set to rise to 70 percent in the cast aluminium wheels for the future generation of the MINI Countryman. The use of secondary aluminium instead of the primary raw material will lead to a reduction of 75 to 85 percent in CO 2 emissions associated with production.

CO 2 -free production, second use and recycling of high-voltage batteries.

With the ramp-up of electromobility, resource-saving production of high-voltage batteries is increasingly coming into focus. The BMW Group has committed all suppliers of battery cells for the current fifth and future sixth generation of BMW eDrive technology to using 100 percent green electricity.

The second use and recycling of high-voltage batteries from electric vehicles were included in the holistic concept for sustainability at an early stage. The BMW Group has been involved in various initiator projects for the further use and recycling of high-voltage batteries since 2013. Prominent examples include the battery storage systems at the BMW Group plant in Leipzig and at the ferry terminal in Hamburg. The reusability of high-voltage batteries after a long car life as stationary power storage devices and as a means of keeping the public energy grid stable was first demonstrated with the début of the BMW i3 in 2013.

At the same time, the BMW Group is working with various partners to promote recycling and the establishment of closed-loop material cycles (circularity) for battery cells. By the time substantial numbers of end-of-life vehicles have been returned, the most suitable process will have been industrialised. There is still no significant number of old high-voltage batteries available, since the the BMW Group designs these for the life of the vehicle and the oldest of them are only nine years old.

The proportion of secondary raw materials used in current BMW high-voltage batteries is increasing. Going forward, the mix of recycling and further use will also depend on raw material prices for battery cells. It is not yet foreseeable how the situation will evolve, which is why the BMW Group is pursuing both strands.Together with German recycling specialist Duesenfeld, the BMW Group has developed a process that aims to achieve a recycling rate of more than 95 percent – including graphite and electrolytes. In China, the BMW Brilliance Automotive joint venture (BBA) has established a closed loop for reuse of the raw materials nickel, lithium and cobalt from high-voltage batteries. The raw materials obtained in this way are used in production of new battery cells for the BMW Group. The closed-loop material cycle conserves resources and reduces CO 2 emissions by around 70 percent compared to using newly extracted primary material.

Digital tools for greater sustainability in design, development and production.

Catena-X and generative design.

The cross-industry data network Catena-X and generative design with new computer-assisted method for the development of vehicle components show how digitalisation can accelerate progress towards sustainable mobility. Digital tools and the associated innovations are also making a significant contribution to continuously increasing sustainability in the supply chain and in the design of BMW Group vehicles.

BMW AG is one of the initiators of the Catena-X partner network, which, through the establishment of a networked database, is also laying the groundwork for the creation a circular economy and the consistent reduction of CO 2 emissions in the supply chain. Around a year after its launch, the alliance for the secure exchange of data across companies in the automotive industry is now presenting its first applications ready for testing in practice. Within the BMW Group, digitalisation in the form of generative design is playing an increasingly important role in the efficient and resource-saving design of vehicle components. Using computer algorithms, designers and engineers can create complex component geometries that enable a significant reduction in material usage and weight, and in some cases even deliver improved or completely new functionality that would not be possible with conventional methods.

Go-ahead for the first practical applications: Catena-X.

Catena-X enables the secure and anonymous exchange of data between automotive manufacturers, suppliers and IT companies. More than 1,000 companies and institutions are now part of the network – including automotive manufacturers, software companies, suppliers, equipment manufacturers, dealer associations, universities and research institutes. Small and medium-sized companies can also join Catena-X. All participants benefit from standardised access to information and data, which optimises efficiency in industry-specific cooperation and accelerates company processes. Digital images of vehicles that can be retrieved on the digital platform can help to develop innovative business processes and service offerings more quickly and efficiently.

In addition to the benefits of greater efficiency in the supply chain, Catena-X participants can expect more efficient quality and logistics management as well as greater transparency in terms of sustainably reduced CO 2 emissions at all stages of the value chain. Alongside the ramp-up of electromobility, progress in reducing CO 2 emissions and conserving resources in the supply chain is the decisive factor in achieving the ambitious sustainability targets that the BMW Group has set itself. The network enables the companies involved in Catena-X to manage their carbon footprint just as precisely as conventional business figures relating to purchasing volumes, production capacities, sales data, revenue and profits. A common set of rules and standardised calculation methods coordinated with relevant NGOs lay the foundation that will allow the product carbon footprint (PCF) of each individual component to be specified with real data instead of average values in the future. This results in credible and transparent reporting on the achievement of sustainability goals in the supply chain and in vehicle production.

Catena-X also enables vehicle components to be tracked throughout their entire product life cycle – from raw material procurement to recycling. With this data, the recycling of components can be planned much more precisely. Which raw materials are required? What secondary materials are available? With Catena-X, it will be possible to answer these kinds of questions in real time in the future, thus facilitating the transformation of supply chains into material cycles. In addition to the environmental benefits, the economic benefits of a circular economy can also be precisely quantified. Along with financial savings potential, the databases will also provide information about improvements in the carbon footprint associated with the use of secondary materials.

Breakthrough in the NEUE KLASSE: Generative design.

Digital processes are increasing energy, resource and cost efficiency in the development and production of vehicle components. Generative design is rapidly gaining importance at the BMW Group as a method for the automated development of vehicle components. The design of components using computer algorithms is expected to be established as a standard method by 2025. Around 20 percent of all vehicle components could potentially be developed and designed using this digital technology. For the models of the NEUE KLASSE, generative methods will be employed for the first time to develop structural components such as the substructure of the rear seat system, for example.

Generative design enables the construction of components with complex geometries and optimal use of materials. Their weight is up to 50 percent lower than conventionally developed components. Algorithms from the fields of quantum computing and artificial intelligence can be used for particularly demanding tasks, thereby significantly accelerating the design of components.

The BMW i8 Roadster launched in 2017 was the first production vehicle to use a component developed with the aid of generative design. The aluminium mountings for connecting the convertible top to the body of the open plug-in hybrid sports car were designed using this method and then produced in a 3D printing process.

Urban mobility.

Diverse concepts for sustainable mobility in the city.

As part of its holistic approach to sustainability across the entire value chain, the BMW Group is developing not only locally emission-free vehicles, but also diverse concepts for future-oriented mobility in urban areas. To increase sustainability in the use phase and at the same time promote the attractiveness of cities as living spaces for their residents, the company is examining the entire urban mobility ecosystem. The aim is to promote acceptance of sustainable mobility solutions and to improve the transport infrastructure. This affects all areas of individual mobility and especially urban areas, where the changes in mobility originate and where they are particularly necessary.

Cities worldwide are faced with the task of counteracting the increasing densification of living and transport areas. The BMW Group is convinced that these challenges can be met with the help of innovations that offer concrete solutions against pollutant and noise emissions, traffic jams and the shortage of public space. These innovative solutions help cities to meet the mobility needs of their residents in an efficient, attractive and sustainable way, while ensuring quality of life in the urban environment.

For three decades, the BMW Group has been working with cities, universities, companies, associations, politicians and society in general on solutions for the transformation of urban mobility towards more sustainability. In cooperation with these partners, studies for the analysis of mobility needs, visions for the city of the future, concrete concepts and collaborative projects for the transformation of urban mobility area are being created. The aim is to ensure an efficient and safe flow of traffic for road users such as commuters and at the same time to guarantee a high quality of life and recreational spaces in the urban area.

Four lighthouse cities and numerous other partnerships.

In the four lighthouse cities of Munich, Rotterdam, Beijing and Los Angeles, as well as in Berlin and Hamburg, urban test laboratories for innovation in the fields of electromobility and charging infrastructure, multimodal transport, autonomous driving and digital solutions for optimising road safety and traffic flow are being created. There, concepts for locally emission-free, safe and efficient mobility come to maturity, which are practically implemented, tested and scaled in pilot projects in order to then be transferred to other cities.

The BMW Group is also involved in intelligent traffic management initiatives to reduce CO 2 emissions. The New Mobility Berlin project initiated by the BMW Group has been developing solutions since 2016 to achieve balance between the shortage of space, changing space requirements and mobility needs in a growing city. The project, executed in cooperation with the city administration, TU Berlin and the local community, creates convenient, sustainable options for inner-city mobility and is continuously being developed.

The expansion of the digital mobility-as-a-service platform FREE NOW into a multimobility app promotes the linking of different modes of transport. FREE NOW provides access to almost 180,000 vehicles in more than 150 European cities – including eScooters, car sharing, taxis and private hire vehicles – and supports the increasing integration of local public transport.

Convenient charging solutions and digital services: Promotion of electromobility requires an attractive ecosystem.

To promote locally emission-free mobility in urban areas, the BMW Group is involved not only in the development of attractive vehicles with electrified drives, but also in the field of public infrastructure for e-mobility. Acceptance of electromobility is being actively promoted through a large number of projects intended to make this infrastructure more efficient and transparent and its use more convenient and attractive. With the public charging offering from BMW Charging and MINI Charging, users register just once to gain access to more than 375,000 public charge points from around 1,000 charging infrastructure operators in Europe alone at attractive rates. Throughout Europe, all BMW Charging and MINI Charging customers charge with 100% green electricity. The BMW Group also has a stake in Digital Charging Solutions GmbH, which develops digital charging solutions for automotive manufacturers and fleet operators. The integration of these charging solutions into the vehicle’s operating system makes it particularly easy and convenient to use public charging stations.

The Charge & Repark project supports the efficient use of public charging stations. The project, initiated by the BMW Group in Rotterdam, includes a digital app that notifies customers as soon as charging is complete, motivating them to move their vehicle.

The BMW eDrive Zones digital service ensures that plug-in hybrid models automatically switch to all-electric driving mode upon entering “Umweltzonen” (environment zones) and other defined areas of a city. This service also helps local authorities to achieve sustainability targets. It was created as a pilot project in Rotterdam, one of the four lighthouse cities, and after a successful test phase was continuously rolled out to other urban areas. BMW eDrive Zones are now available in 148 European and three US cities.

CO 2 -free, space-saving, quiet and emotive: Electric single-track vehicles for sustainable urban mobility.

The BMW Group has more than 30 years of experience in the field of urban mobility concepts as well as outstanding development expertise in the field of electromobility.

With electric single-track vehicles, the company offers an ideal solution for locally emission-free, versatile and emotive mobility in inner cities. With significantly lower energy consumption compared to electric cars, they represent a highly efficient mobility solution. Their use reduces not only CO 2 and noise emissions, but also the need for traffic and parking spaces in urban areas.

BMW CE 04: The new electric star for the city.

TheBMW CE 04 has quickly become a symbol of progressive urban mobility. The purely electrically powered scooter from BMW Motorrad combines a future-oriented design with the latest drive technology and clever functionality. “The new electric star for the city,” as Oliver Zipse, CEO of BMW AG, describes it, is leading a silent revolution in urban two-wheeled mobility with an emission-free drive.

With a maximum output of 31 kW/42 hp, the BMW CE 04 has a powerful motor. From a standing start, it can sprint to 50 km/h in just 2.6 seconds. Its high-quality battery and charging technology supports a range of around 130 kilometres and quick replenishment of the energy supply. This enables day-to-day emission-free riding in the city, in an urban setting and for smaller-scale fun tours after work or at the weekend – with complete peace of mind. The standard equipment of the BMW CE 04 includes a cockpit featuring a 10.25 -inch colour screen with comprehensive connectivity functions.

BMW Motorrad Concept CE 02: A breath of fresh air for urban electromobility.

Like the BMW CE 04, all new BMW Motorrad models specifically designed for urban mobility will in future be powered purely by electricity. The BMW Group is working on extremely diverse creative approaches for the urban single-track vehicles of the future. The BMW Motorrad Concept CE 02 is a new and highly emotive mobility offering. With an innovative design language, new proportions and modern forms, the concept expresses a new facet of the brand character of BMW Motorrad. Thanks to the flat vehicle body, the centre of gravity of the BMW Motorrad Concept CE 02 is low and favourable when it comes to driving dynamics. At the same time, the large disc wheels and low seat height make it look inviting and confidence-inspiring.

The design and vehicle concept of the BMW Motorrad Concept CE 02 are based on the needs of a new target group: young people aged 16 and over who want to discover the joy of urban two-wheeled mobility for themselves for the first time. As a lightweight e-vehicle weighing about 120 kilogrammes, the BMW Motorrad Concept CE 02 is ideal for urban use, offering a high fun factor. The 11 kW of output and all the drive torque available directly from a standstill allow for fast acceleration at traffic lights and a top speed of 90 km/h.

Concept innovation in two forms: BMW Motorrad Vision AMBY and BMW i Vision AMBY.

Further proof of the broad range of creative solutions of the BMW Group for sustainable urban mobility is provided by a concept between bicycle and motorbike, which is presented in two versions. The BMW Motorrad Vision AMBY and BMW i Vision AMBY concepts interpret the fundamental idea of sustainable and at the same time emotive mobility in an urban setting based on two different facets. Both vehicles have an electric drive. While the BMW i Vision AMBY, a high-speed pedelec, requires constant pedalling in order to benefit from the assistance of the electric drive, the BMW Motorrad Vision AMBY is accelerated using the throttle grip and has footrests instead of pedals, as is typical of a motorcycle.

The word AMBY stands for “Adaptive Mobility”. The electric drive of both vehicles supports CO 2 -free riding with three speed levels for different types of roads. Its top speed is 25 km/h on cycle paths, 45 km/h on inner-city roads and 60 km/h on multi-lane roads and out of town.

Manual selection of the speed level is conceivable, as is detection of the road currently being travelled by means of geofencing technology, thereby allowing automatic adjustment of the top speed. As there is currently no legal basis for such a vehicle with an adaptive and modular speed concept, the BMW Motorrad Vision AMBY and BMW i Vision AMBY also set out to prompt the introduction of such legislation with the aim of paving the way for practical implementation of this innovative concept for sustainable urban mobility.

Recycling raw materials in a circular economy sense is intended to achieve the best possible resource efficiency.

The BMW Group continues to adhere to its ambitious sustainability targets and will reduce its CO 2 emissions by 40 per cent per vehicle by 2030 across the entire value chain compared to 2019. “We are consistently driving the issue of sustainability with our innovations,” says Thomas Becker, Head of Sustainability and Mobility at the BMW Group. “The current raw materials debate also validates our drive towards a circular economy. We want to make the best possible use of the raw materials in our end-of-life vehicles and recycle them in the production of new vehicles. We will continue to reduce CO 2 emissions and conserve natural resources through maximum energy and raw material efficiency.” An average of almost 30 per cent of BMW Group vehicles are already made from recycled and reused materials today, so-called “secondary raw materials”. In the longer term, the “Secondary First” approach aims to increase this figure to 50 per cent.

The BMW Group is the first German car manufacturer to join the “Science Based Targets initiative” (SBTi) “Business Ambition for 1.5°C”. This means the company’s path to climate neutrality is following a scientifically validated and transparent path that is in line with the most ambitious target of the Paris Climate Agreement. At the same time, the company is committed to the goal of complete climate neutrality across the entire value chain no later than 2050.

360-degree approach across the entire value chain

The BMW Group is consistently driving forward the electrification of its entire fleet. By 2030, at least one in two cars sold by the BMW Group is to be fully electric. The MINI and Rolls-Royce Motor Cars brands will offer only fully electric vehicles from the beginning of the 2030s. For example, the BMW Group aims to reduce CO 2 emissions per vehicle in the use phase by 50 per cent by 2030 compared to 2019.

“However, sustainability means much more for the BMW Group than merely building and selling electrically powered vehicles,” says Thomas Becker. “Only a comprehensive sustainability approach from resource to recycling actually achieves a bottom-line reduction of CO 2 emissions.” CO 2 savings in the supply chain are becoming enormously important as e-mobility ramps up, especially in view of the energy-intensive production of high-voltage batteries. Nevertheless, the BMW Group aims to buck the trend by reducing CO 2 emissions in the supply chain by 20 per cent by 2030, compared to 2019 values, and by as much as 80 per cent in production. The BMW Group’s global production network is already carbon net neutral thanks to selected offsetting initiatives.

Responsible sourcing of raw materials, conservation of natural resources

The BMW Group has set itself the goal of building the most sustainable supply chain in the entire automotive industry. The focus here is on reducing CO 2 emissions, protecting natural resources and complying with environmental and social standards.

As e-mobility ramps up, the raw materials needed specifically for e-drive components now come under the spotlight. The design principle for the current-generation BMW eDrive electric motors eliminates the need to use rare earth materials in the rotor. The BMW Group is also taking its own approach to sourcing the raw materials needed to produce high-voltage batteries with the objective of achieving complete transparency in the origin and mining methods of the material: the company purchases lithium and cobalt directly and makes it available to battery cell manufacturers.

“Green steel” reduces CO 2 emissions by up to 95 per cent

When it comes to reducing CO 2 emissions in the supply chain, using electricity from renewable sources can achieve spectacular progress. The BMW Group has already entered into more than 400 contracts with its suppliers to use 100 per cent green electricity. This also includes aluminium suppliers as well as the producers of the battery cells, for example. The BMW Group has been sourcing aluminium from the United Arab Emirates since February 2021 using electricity generated from solar energy. From 2024 onwards, all cast aluminium wheels for the brands BMW and MINI will also be produced using only green electricity. Regeneratively generated energy is used both in the energy-intensive electrolysis when producing aluminium and when casting the wheels.

CO 2 emissions are also being continuously reduced in the steel supply chain. From 2025 onwards, the BMW Group will purchase CO 2 -reduced steel that is produced not using fossil-based raw materials such as coal, but instead using natural gas or hydrogen and green electricity. This reduces CO 2 emissions from making this steel by up to 95 per cent. The BMW Group will provide over 40 per cent of the demand at its European plants from this by 2030. This will reduce CO 2 emissions by up to 400,000 tonnes per year.

Circular economy as the key to more sustainability

The BMW Group is focusing on significantly increasing the proportion of secondary materials in its vehicles with a view to further reducing the depletion of raw materials and emissions. The BMW i Vision Circular has already demonstrated how consistently a car can be designed following the principles of the circular economy. As well as organic-based raw materials, it primarily uses materials that have already gone through a product life cycle and in turn have 100 per cent recyclability. The aim is to recycle raw materials from end-of-life vehicles as effectively as possible for the series production of new cars in the future.

The example set by the BMW i Vision Circular makes it clear that resource conservation begins with a vehicle’s design. This includes consistently reducing components, material groups and surface finishes. Instead of composite materials and adhesives, the BMW i Vision Circular primarily uses mono-materials as well as cords, buttons or quick-release fasteners, meaning that the individual components can be easily separated from one another and recycled according to type when they later come to be recycled.

Innovative recycling processes as the basis for effective circular economy

The BMW Group is also doing important groundwork around vehicle recycling on the road to a closed-loop economy. Up to 10,000 BMW, MINI, Rolls-Royce and BMW Motorrad vehicles are recycled each year at the BMW Group’s Recycling and Dismantling Centre (RDZ) in Unterschleißheim near Munich. They are dismantled in a standardised process that focuses on identifying reusable components as well as materials that are suitable for recycling. BMW Group designers and development engineers use the expertise gained by the RDZ to optimise the recyclability of new models right from the start. The findings are also being shared with our partners. The BMW Group played a key role in setting up the IDIS (International Dismantling Information System) platform. The data and findings published there are available to recyclers around the world.

The RDZ has also used innovative methods for many years to recycle high-voltage batteries from electrified vehicles. Processes have been developed in conjunction with partners from industry and science that can achieve a recycling rate of more than 90 per cent. The BMW Group has also shared this expertise to foster general progress in the field of battery recycling.

In China, the BMW Brilliance Automotive (BBA) joint venture has now for the first time established a closed cycle for reusing the raw materials nickel, lithium and cobalt from high-voltage batteries. The raw materials extracted are used in production of new battery cells for the BMW Group. The closed material cycle conserves the consumption of resources and reduces CO 2 emissions by around 70 per cent compared to using newly mined primary material.

Sustainable production: less CO 2 , waste and water consumption

Circular economy principles also influence production processes. The BMW Group has established closed loops for steel and aluminium between its production sites and suppliers. As a result, around 70 per cent of the steel waste from the pressing plants and the aluminium residues are reused through a direct circular economy (the closed loop).

The BMW Group has reduced CO 2 emissions attributable to vehicle production by more than 70 per cent since 2006. All plants in the international production network have been CO 2 -neutral since 2021. Alongside this, water consumption and waste generation have also been continuously reduced. For example, only around 580 grams of residual waste were produced per vehicle manufactured in 2021 at the BMW Group’s largest European plant in Dingolfing.

Energy efficiency, resource conservation and waste avoidance are being further improved at the BMW Group’s production sites with the transformation into an iFACTORY. The new BMW Group plant in the north-west of the Hungarian city of Debrecen, where our “Neue Klasse” models will be built from 2025 onwards, is a prime example of vehicle production that is consistently geared towards sustainability and the circular economy.

Responsibility for the environment

The 360-degree sustainability approach not only encompasses the entire value chain from resource extraction to production and recycling, but also all levels of sustainability with ecological, economic and social aspects.

The company supports initiatives such as the World Wildlife Fund For Nature’s (WWF) commitment to deep-sea mining as part of its efforts to promote responsible raw material extraction. The BMW Group is declining to use minerals from the deep sea, or to finance deep-sea mining, until the consequences of deep-sea mining on the ecosystems have been comprehensively investigated scientifically and adequate protection for the deep sea can be guaranteed.

Even though no cobalt from the Democratic Republic of Congo is used in the fifth-generation BMW eDrive high-voltage batteries, the BMW Group continues to be involved in a local project there. Together with partners, the company has commissioned the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) (German Society for International Cooperation) to develop measures to improve the working and living conditions of the micro-mining workers and the residents in the surrounding communities.

Responsibility towards the workforce and society

The BMW Group is also intensively fulfilling its responsibility towards its workforce in the current phase of transformation towards electromobility and digitalisation. The largest training initiative in the Group’s history is currently underway. The BMW Group invested around €389 million in 2021 in training and development for its employees. More than 75,000 attendees developed skills in these future fields, enabling them to help shape the transformation within the BMW Group.

The BMW Group positions itself as a reliable and credible employer when it comes to attracting talented and creative professionals; one that guarantees long-term sustainable jobs and attractive employee participation in the company’s success. Individual career development, support for social commitment and a consistent commitment to diversity and against discrimination also demonstrate how the BMW Group lives its social responsibility in practice both internally and externally.

The BMW Group, a company with a multinational workforce and locations on five continents, engages actively in society and stands by its responsibility as part of the bigger picture. Intercultural understanding, solid education for children and young people, and road safety are among the areas to which the company is committed.

The BMW Group also promotes initiatives by its employees. One current example of this is the “PowerUp” project run by two BMW Group young professionals. The idea: a powerful storage block consisting of six high-voltage batteries from former development vehicles stores solar energy from a photovoltaic system and supplies a school near the BMW Group plant in Rosslyn, South Africa. This can generate 36 kWh of clean electricity every day. Enough for about 38 computers, 100 light bulbs and a water pump. Thanks to the high-voltage batteries from Lohhof near Munich, not only does the school save on electricity costs, it also reduces its CO 2 emissions by 40 tonnes a year.

Monika Dernai, the head of the sustainability team at BMW, said this week that one simple way of reducing waste and the impact of automobiles on the environment is simply to make them last longer.

“We really need to think about prolonging the life of cars; not having a used car market where you sell cars to each other, but maybe take a car and extend its lifespan,” said Dernai, per AutoExpress. “The idea could be that you could freshen up the interior.”

The question of how best reduce the automotive industry’s impact on the environment is a complex one, as countries look to phase out internal combustion vehicles in favor of newer, electric ones. But as is often pointed out, the production of electric vehicles is hard on the environment.

The truth, though, is that the production of all vehicles is hard on the environment. According to Volvo, for instance, steel accounts for an average of 33 percent of its vehicles’ carbon footprint and the global steel industry accounts for seven percent of all global greenhouse gas emissions.

The transportation sector, meanwhile, accounted for 27 percent of America’s greenhouse gases in 2020, according to the EPA. So, while it’s important to replace polluting internal combustion vehicles with electric vehicles that emit considerably less, it will also be important for those EVs to be long-lasting. And that may require new skills.

“We need new skill sets in the aftermarket and to design cars so that the seat can be removed, and a fresh seat can be moved in – then it’s a used car that looks like a new car,” said Dernai. “It can have the same owner, who then doesn’t buy a new car, but we still have a business model as BMW and the whole of society benefits from that.”

Dernai pointed to the importance of making the automotive industry greener because of the realities of how infrastructure is set up. While it may be ideal for people in large cities to use public transport, that doesn’t work for everyone.

“Can we actually just move everybody to public transport? I think the answer is no,” she said. “You’re worried about the public transport in the U.K., but if you look at the US it’s even more desolate. So I think there’s still a market for cars out there.”",BMW’s Head Of Sustainability Says Making Cars Last Longer Could Help The Environment

The Environmental Action Germany group, or Deutsche Umwelthilfe (DUH) — as the group is known in Germany — hoped the lawsuit could convince the courts to tell BMW to stop selling ICE-equipped cars by 2030, according to the Associated Press.



The DUH argued that allowing BMW to continue selling combustion-powered cars poses a threat “to people’s right to property, health and life” given these cars’ greenhouse gas emissions. But a court in Munich threw the suit out on Tuesday, citing “no threat of illegal encroachment” upon anybody’s rights on the part of BMW. The court qualified its ruling by saying that there was no current threat, at least.

That’s what makes the lawsuit being thrown out amusing: climate activists are more or less arguing that irreparable harm is being done, but it will take years to confirm. So until individuals or corporations are held accountable in advance, the courts are powerless to intervene. BMW was pleased with the ruling, saying that “efforts to cut emissions should be determined by democratically elected parliaments, not in the courts,” as the AP notes.

Of course, the suit being rejected is no surprise, since German courts have already sided with other German automakers: DUH brought a similar suit earlier against Mercedes-Benz. The activists were pushing for an end to M-B’s combustion-powered cars by 2030, but a court in Stuttgart threw out the lawsuit last year. This and previous dismissals have set a precedent that we are now seeing in effect.



The latest BWM ruling added that while the environmentalists’ argument was valid on its surface, the lawsuit didn’t hold up in court because lawmakers in Germany are allegedly working towards the goals set by the Paris climate accord of 2015. Any measures enacted after the Paris accords are proof enough (in the eyes of the courts) that Germany is doing something to address greenhouse gas emissions.

The argument from the DUH is that Germany may be doing something, but it’s not doing enough, and that’s where the courts have washed their hands clean despite saying the “plaintiffs’ arguments couldn’t be dismissed from the outset.”

The environmentalists could still appeal the ruling, which is what they’ve done with the Mercedes-Benz lawsuit, and what they will probably do when the courts inevitably reject a similar lawsuit against German oil and gas major Wintershell Dea, scheduled to be heard in August. Indeed, it could be appeals all the way down.",A German Court Dismissed a Climate Lawsuit Against BMW

The car will use fuel cells developed by Toyota, this new car, a milestone in the use of hydrogen power, can reach speeds of up to 112 miles per hour.

The hydrogen itself is stored in two tanks which can be refilled in a matter of three to four minutes. Once the tanks are filled, the vehicle has displayed a range of 313 miles in the Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure.

The car is being assembled at a factory in Munich.

While it enters service in 2023, initially the rollout will be relatively small: fewer than 100 cars will be coming off the assembly line and sent abroad for trialling and demonstrations for sundry target groups.

A path to the future

The star of hydrogen appears to be rising in the automotive world. BMW is one of the larger manufacturers looking to innovate with the element, but others include Nissan, Hyundai and the aforementioned Toyota.

Commented BMW Chairman of the Board of Management Oliver Zipse: “Hydrogen is a versatile energy source that has a key role to play in the energy transition process and, therefore, in climate protection. After all, it is one of the most efficient ways of storing and transporting renewable energies.

“We should use this potential to also accelerate the transformation of the mobility sector. Hydrogen is the missing piece in the jigsaw when it comes to emission-free mobility.

The goal of these billboards is to not only spotlight the harsh truth, but to call local governments into action to ban ads that promote combustion vehicles.

Brandalism is a UK-based artist and activist collective that, per its website manifesto, dreams of a world “emptied of mad empires, manufactured fears, paranoid dreams and marauded lands.” The group declares that it will speak truth against oppression and injustice and has campaigned against such social issues as body image, visceral “advertising pollution,” and of course, environmental issues like climate change.

Earlier this week, the group shared the following Tweet thread, outlining a subvertising campaign aimed at exposing legacy automakers like Toyota for misleading advertisements that are pro-BEV, despite publicly lobbying against anti-climate policies.

We’ve called out Toyota several times for this behavior and were delighted to see activists from Brandalism, Subvertisers’ International, and Extinction Rebellion band together to install over 400 parody billboards across 14 different European cities.

These activists and artists deserve credit for their work, so we highly recommend reading the entire Twitter thread and visiting each of the organizations websites to learn more on join the fight against climate change and social injustice. In the meantime, here are a few examples of their subvertising expertise on display throughout Europe.

In a recent article posted by Brandalism sharing the reasoning behind the subvertising campaign, a spokesperson for the collective named Tona Merriman spoke to the greenwashing tactics being used by Toyota and BMW, and why there is no longer room in European society for those types of ad campaigns anymore:

Toyota have pushed their ‘Beyond Zero’ sustainability adverts whilst lobbying governments around the world to weaken air quality plans and threatening legal action to protect their profits over a liveable climate. Their adverts are duplicitous. Toyota and BMW use slick marketing campaigns to promote over-sized SUV models that clog up urban neighbourhoods. Electric SUVs are no solution – they’re too big for most parking spaces and their tall bumper size and excessive weight present an increased risk to pedestrians, especially children, involved in road collisions.

With an expiry on gas and diesel vehicles already in place in Europe and the UK starting in 2030, the activists are demanding an immediate end to advertising for all combustion vehicles. This aim is similar to tobacco-style legislation enacted in the 1990s that ended advertising of potentially deadly smoking products.

The subvertising ads calling out Toyota and BMW have been installed at bus stops, on billboards, and on tube advertising spaces in London, Berlin, Stuttgart, Paris, Nantes, Brussels, Ghent, Bristol, Derby, Glasgow, Norwich, Brighton, Exeter, and Reading.

BMW and Jaguar Land Rover’s leather suppliers are linked to illegal deforestation in the territory of one of the world’s most threatened uncontacted tribes, according to an official complaint launched today by Survival International.

Two Italian companies, Pasubio and Gruppo Mastrotto, source leather from tanneries that are supplied by cattle ranches guilty of occupying and illegally deforesting the land of uncontacted members of Paraguay’s Ayoreo tribe. These Ayoreo are the last uncontacted Indigenous people in South America outside the Amazon, and the ranches threaten their very existence.

BMW, Jaguar Land Rover and many others buy the two companies’ leather to make interiors, seats and steering wheels.

This link is at the heart of a formal complaint filed today by Survival International, in agreement with and authorized by contacted Ayoreo people, against Pasubio at Italy’s ‘National Contact Point’ (NCP) for the OECD.

A few weeks ago, Survival sent cease-and-desist letters to both companies urging them to halt these imports. Gruppo Mastrotto has responded by initiating a dialogue with Survival, which is still ongoing, but Pasubio has sent only a brief disclaimer. Survival has therefore, in agreement with and authorized by contacted Ayoreo people, submitted a formal complaint against Pasubio under the OECD’s Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises.

The link between the leather used in the car industry and the illegal destruction of the Ayoreo’s forest was first revealed in an investigation by Earthsight. In two reports, Grand Theft Chaco I and Grand Theft Chaco II, Earthsight revealed that almost two-thirds of the hides exported from Paraguay go to Italian companies, principally Pasubio, which depends for more than 90% of its €313m annual revenue on the automotive industry.

Today’s complaint states that Pasubio appears to have violated several principles in the OECD Guidelines, including those on Disclosure of Information (III), Human Rights (IV), Environment (VI) and Consumer Interests (VIII) and demands that the company stops importing hides from tanneries in Paraguay that are responsible for and/or involved in the deforestation of the Ayoreo’s forest.

The head of Survival’s Ayoreo campaign, Teresa Mayo said today: “The Paraguayan government has handed over most of the Ayoreo’s ancestral territory to agribusiness companies who are relentlessly clearing the forest: first they cut down the valuable hardwoods, then they set fire to the forest, and finally they introduce livestock onto the cleared land. The Ayoreo are witnessing the destruction of their livelihoods, their physical and mental health, and even their lives. But they remain determined to fight for their continued existence, alongside their uncontacted relatives, who are forced to live on the run from bulldozers in oases of forest that are getting smaller and smaller every day.""

Francesca Casella, director of Survival Italy, said today: “Demand for car leather is predicted to increase by more than 5% per year until 2027. Clients and end-consumers need to be aware of this, and since Italy is the world’s biggest buyer of Paraguayan leather, it has the power and responsibility to intervene by stopping doing business with cattle ranches that operate illegally on Indigenous land with the connivance of corrupt politicians and officials.”

Tagüide Picanerai, an Ayoreo Totobiegosode man, said today: “The harmful impact that beef and leather production has is deforestation, and that affects the people living in the area (…). Leather is like a hidden aspect of cattle ranching, it isn’t taken into account as we only talk about beef, but it really does affect the local people a lot. It’s those who produce the cattle and export them and then sell them over there in Europe who benefit, but here it means deforestation and the Ayoreo people suffer.”

Notes to Editors:

- The Ayoreo number more than 5,000 and live in Paraguay and Bolivia. One sub-group, known as the Ayoreo-Totobiegosode, are the subject of this complaint. Most Ayoreo-Totobiegosode are contacted and live in settled communities in Paraguay, but some are still uncontacted.

- The Ayoreo Totobiegosode have been fighting for the return of their ancestral lands since 1993, when they presented a formal land claim to the government.

- In 2001, the government of Paraguay formally recognised a 550,000 hectare territory in Alto Paraguay province as the ’Natural and Cultural Heritage of the Ayoreo Totobiegosode (PNCAT). However, to date the authorities have only transferred some tens of thousands of hectares of land titles to the Ayoreo, and they continue to violate both the injunction issued by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) over the territory (which requires the State of Paraguay to protect and safeguard the PNCAT and the uncontacted groups living there by preventing the entry of third parties and unwanted contact); and resolutions issued in 2018 by the National Forestry Institute (INFONA), which prohibit all deforestation inside the area.

- Paraguay’s meat and hides are responsible, per unit weight, for more deforestation than any other raw material on Earth (Grand Theft Chaco I, p. 36).

- Paraguay’s Chaco forest is being destroyed at one of the fastest rates on Earth.

Why: When it comes to the big car companies and the environment, most of the conversation is about electric vehicles. But BMW feels it has a bigger story to tell about its efforts to make the manufacturing process itself more sustainable—from the energy that powers its production plants, to the materials it sources for parts, and the recycling efforts at all stages of the process.

BMW was named the most sustainable automotive company in the world according to the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices, said Jonathan Thomson, director, BMW brand management. “The ability to have a USP in the marketplace—like we have with sustainability—for us it’s something that’s worth talking about.”

But rather than just tell its own story—“It would be a little one dimensional,” said Thomson—BMW wanted to help support and share the story of other small businesses and entrepreneurs similarly committed to sustainability. “It felt like the perfect marriage of what we’re proud of in the work that we’re doing, but creating a more interesting message for this content piece.”

How: Each of the episodes—which range in length from 7:42 to 9:44—profiles one of the six entrepreneurs. At the CBC site and on Gem and YouTube, the content is listed as paid content and starts with a super that explains why BMW produced the series: “BMW’s mission is to be the world’s most sustainable automotive manufacturer and they’re finding and showcasing similar sustainable endeavours globally.”

Early in each episode, Romanow gets into the BMW electric iX xDrive50, and introduces the people being profiled. They include the founders of drone reforestation company Flash Forest, who believe we must plant more trees to tackle Co2 emissions. Another profile is of former Navy Commander Mike Williamson, who is trying to grow seaweed more sustainably, and creating better supply chains for this ecologically significant crop.

Towards the end of each episode Romanow returns to spell out the connection between the entrepreneurs and BMW’s own efforts to be more sustainable.

“Flash Forests’ innovative tree planting technology is trying to reverse the impact of carbon emissions, and BMW has redesigned their business to lower their emissions,” she says.

In the episode about seaweed, she explains that sourcing sustainable materials is key to a healthy supply chain. “Just like how Mike is taking on the supply chain of seaweed, BMW has redesigned their supply chain to better source raw materials that go into electric vehicles like cobalt in a more environmentally friendly way,” she ays.

Other topics covered in future episodes include renewable energy, sustainable materials, the circular economy, and innovative technology.",BMW content series shines a light on sustainability -

Electro fuels made from green energy sources may play a role in decarbonising road transport in years to come, complementing other clean propulsion technologies such as electric power, according to German auto manufacturer BMW.

As carmakers around the world convert massively to electric mobility, BMW is among the few still investing in the internal combustion engine as part of a “technology neutral” approach to zero-emission vehicles.

“To be technology open includes e-fuels,” Peter Lehnert, vice president of research and new technologies with the BMW Group, told EURACTIV.

“However, I think there’s a lot of research to do to scale it up to the potential where it plays a major role in the whole energy mix,” he added.

“I think it’s always good to have different opportunities. We invest in the combustion engine, as there might be chances for them in the future. For urban mobility I’m sure it will be electric,” he said.

Lehnert was speaking from Lisbon, which is hosting the Transport Research Arena (TRA), the largest European research and technology conference on transport and mobility.

Electric fuels

E-fuels are derived from hydrogen through electrolysis, in which an electric current is used to separate hydrogen and oxygen molecules. If CO2 is added, the fuel becomes compatible with current-generation combustion engines.

As CO2 is captured for production and then released when the fuel is combusted, the net level of carbon in the atmosphere is unchanged, making the fuel carbon neutral.

To be classed as green, the energy-intensive e-fuel production process must be made using only renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power.

“In the end, e-fuels need to be produced by green power, otherwise it doesn’t match our targets under the European Green Deal,” said Lehnert.

In looking to the future of road transport, Lehnert said it would be a mistake to choose one technology to the exclusion of others.

“We mentioned hydrogen, it might be e-fuels as well. I think it’s not a question of focusing only on one technology, this is something that is really high risk,” he added.

Lehnert said that the BMW Group, which represents the BMW, Mini, and Rolls-Royce brands, is keeping its mind open regarding energy sources that can cut vehicle emissions.

“Investigating e-fuels is definitely worth it, however we have to look at the balance of the right energy mix,” he said.

BMW has invested in producing hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, breaking from most competitors’ more narrow focus on electric vehicles.

The ability to charge a hydrogen-powered vehicle quickly is a “real advantage” compared to electric vehicles, said Lehnert.

“Especially for long distances, hydrogen is something which is appropriate,” he added.

Asked about the EU’s recently released Euro 7 proposal, which further tightens pollution limits for vehicles, Lehnert said that it’s “good to have a common target” and that the company’s track record with previous standards shows it is “target driven”.

“We take these targets and we are really convinced that we will achieve it,” he said.

EU tightens road vehicle pollution standards ahead of electric switch The long-awaited European Commission proposal to reduce air pollution from vehicles was released Thursday (10 November), modestly tightening exhaust emission standards for cars and vans and placing limits on particles shed from brakes and tyres for the first time.

Lehnert spoke to the press Tuesday (15 November) at the Transport Research Arena conference in Lisbon. The event, which is supported by BMW, gathers researchers, policymakers, and industry to discuss innovation and sustainability in the transport sector.

The role of e-fuels in the road transport sector has proven controversial, with green campaigners criticising support for e-fuels as a way to prolong the life of the internal combustion engine.

Instead, they want to see a faster switch to electric vehicles, which they say offer the cleanest means of driving.

E-fuels will only be able to power 2% of EU car fleet by 2035: analysis Low levels of production mean that e-fuels, a hydrogen-derived fuel source touted as a green solution for internal combustion engine vehicles, will only be able to cover around 2% of the EU’s vehicle fleet by 2035, a new study concludes.

Under recently agreed EU legislation, the sale of polluting vehicles would be banned from 2035 in the bloc, a move which many say spells the end of the internal combustion engine.

However, a non-binding recital clause included in the legislative text obliges the European Commission to conduct a study in 2026 on the possibility of using CO2-neutral fuels, such as e-fuels, to achieve green targets for the road sector.

If the Commission finds that e-fuels are in line with Europe’s climate goals, some believe this will offer a reprieve for the internal combustion engine.

Proponents of e-fuels further position them as a means to decarbonise the current fleet of internal combustion engine vehicles, which will remain on Europe’s roads for decades to come, regardless of rules on their use beyond 2035.

EU finalises deal spelling death of diesel and petrol cars European Union legislators agreed to a deal late Thursday evening (27 October) requiring new cars and vans to be zero-emission as of 2035, a momentous agreement that sets Europe on a trajectory to a largely electric automotive future.

The iX is made in an eco-friendly factory and comes with free rapid charging. Pricing starts at $84,100.

Pros

Cons

What's new?

Made in an eco-friendly factory, the 2023 BMW iX all-electric luxury midsize SUV can be a great choice for those whose plentiful finances are equaled by the desire for responsible personal transport. Pricing starts at $84,100.

The BMW iX is now officially a range. Last year, the lineup was just one model, the xDrive50. This year sees the addition of the 2023 iX M60

This is significant. For BMW to make an M version of what is still a new vehicle without an established track record (so to speak; the iX debuted only last year) shows the company's commitment to electric vehicles while retaining the talents for which BMW cars -- especially versions from the high-performance M division -- are quite rightly praised.

Another aspect of all this is how battery technology is now at the level where it can be a convincing method of propulsion for luxury cars and sporty cars alike. Ranges are great enough to dispel anxiety, charging times are quick enough to be practical. The lithium-ion battery in the iX has an 8-year/100,000-mile warranty.

Speaking of lithium, and cobalt, aluminum, carbon fiber reinforced plastic, and all the other particular elements that go into making a modern electric vehicle, BMW is taking steps to ensure they are all sourced responsibly and sustainably -- with transparency and respecting human rights.

2023 BMW iX pricing

The 2023 BMW iX starts at $84,100. That's for the xDrive50 model. The new-for-2023 iX M60 begins at $108,900.

With options, it isn't hard to equip the xDrive50 so it reaches almost $100K. And despite being well-stocked with standard equipment, the extras offered with the M60 could result in a final price closer to $118K.

BMW also offers two years of free 30-minute charging sessions using the Electrify America network.

These are manufacturer's suggested retail prices and do not include the $995 factory-to-dealer delivery fee.

Competitors include the Tesla Model X, which starts at $121K and has a maximum range of 330 miles. Also, the Audi e-tron (from $71K, range: 226 miles), Mercedes-EQ EQE SUV (from about $75K, range: around 300 miles), Cadillac Lyriq (from $61.8K, range: 312 miles), and the upcoming 2024 Polestar 3 ($83K-ish at launch, range: 300 miles or so).

Before buying a new BMW iX, check the Kelley Blue Book Fair Purchase Price to know what you should really pay. Regarding resale values, Tesla (TSLA) is typically quite strong. The BMW iX debuted just last year, so information is still coming through. Generally speaking, electric vehicles are starting to hold their values well.

What's new for 2023

What used to be called Gesture Control (making certain hand movements to control the infotainment system) is now called Natural Interaction and becomes standard. A previous array of options packages are simplified. An Ultimate package is now offered with the xDrive50, and an Executive package is available with the M60. Both add more convenience, safety and luxury items.

Driving the 2023 BMW iX

Smartphone recognition means never having to dig around in pockets or purses for the car keys to open and start the 2023 iX. For all the technology that comes in the iX, it's still user-friendly. It will automatically select each driver's preferred radio station as well.

Electric motors generate exceptional torque and the iX tackles uphill stretches as if they didn't exist. A pair of them provides all-wheel drive, with the rear motor handling a larger share of the work in normal conditions, creating a sporty feel and maximizing efficiency.

In the xDrive 50, the sprint from standstill to 60 mph happens in a brief 4.6 seconds. Naturally, the more powerful iX M60 is quicker: 3.6 seconds.

The iX feels stable regardless of speed, and remains composed through corners, even though the suspension is tuned primarily for comfort. The iX M60 also has an air suspension as standard, bringing smoothness as well as the kind of precise handling that comes with an M model.

The brake pedal can feel a little too eager initially, but the overall action is acceptable and something the driver can get used to quite quickly.

One facet that has a small learning curve is one-pedal driving. There are three levels of brake energy regeneration, so easing off the throttle slows the vehicle down more than it would in a conventional car with a combustion engine. In the stop/go mayhem of city traffic, this can be a distinct advantage. The right foot rarely has to jump over to the brake pedal and then back again.

Smart interior

Despite the use of recycled materials -- like nylon waste and old fishing nets -- the cabin of the 2023 iX looks and feels as premium as anyone spending the best part of $100K on a vehicle would want.

There's a suitably high-tech atmosphere as well. The 12.3-inch driver information display is incorporated into a larger curved unit (covered with glare-resistant glass) that also accommodates a 14.9-inch infotainment touchscreen. This is complemented by a hexagonal steering wheel.

Adult passengers in the back shouldn't find much to complain about with 38.9 inches of legroom. Behind the 40/20/40 split/folding rear seats is an expansive luggage area of 35.5 cubic feet. With those seats folded, cargo volume maxes out at 77.9 cubic feet.

Some electric cars have an extra storage space under the hood, but BMW doesn't want customers rummaging around there. Adding windshield wiper fluid is done by flipping up the BMW badge.

Intelligent exterior

Size-wise, the 2023 iX is similar to the ever-popular X5. The closer we get to the iX, though, the more the differences stand out. We might as well talk about the grille first, since it's hard to miss.

Firstly, an electric vehicle doesn't really need a grille. But it's a BMW hallmark, so it's part of the iX package, repurposed as an ""Intelligence Panel"" containing sensors for the driver assistance and advanced safety features. The rear BMW badge does something similar, housing the rearview camera. The door handles are flush to the body for optimum aerodynamics, and the headlights are much smaller than an X5's.

On the subject of aerodynamics, the iX has an extremely low drag coefficient of 0.25. This also helps to keep wind noise low.

The new iX M60 has a roof made of carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) to shave off a little weight and lower the center of gravity even more. And the brake calipers are painted that special shade of M blue.

Our favorite features and tech

SustainabilityBMW's ambition is to build electric vehicles cleaner and greener than the competition. This includes responsible sourcing of rare elements like cobalt and lithium for the batteries, fitting recycled materials into the cabins, using solar power to make aluminum components, and hydro-electric power for specialized manufacturing plants.

Infotainment systemMost people familiar with BMW's infotainment system know that it's called iDrive. Now in its eighth iteration, it has evolved to become wonderfully user-friendly and able to incorporate the specific needs of electric vehicles. In the new BMW iX, it comes with a curved 14.9-inch touchscreen, over-the-air updates, advanced voice recognition, and dedicated user profiles.

Rapid chargingBeing able to add 90 miles of range in 10 minutes (using a DC fast charger) is impressive. Just answer a couple of emails and it's time to hit the road again.

Head-up display with augmented realityOptional in the xDrive50, standard in the M60, this head-up display uses augmented reality to superimpose things like arrows onto the road, making navigation information clearer.

Adaptive LED headlights with LaserlightAdaptive headlights follow the direction of the steering. They can also change the shape of the illumination area, so as not to dazzle other road users. The laser tech is more powerful than LEDs, yet require even less energy -- an important consideration for an electric vehicle. These are standard in the M60.

Bowers & Wilkins surround-sound systemExclusive to the M60, this 30-speaker/1,615-watt arrangement is an absolute treat for the ears.

Battery power, charge times, and range

In the regular 2023 iX xDrive50, 516 horsepower and 564 lb-ft of torque is developed by twin electric motors. They're constructed in such a way that no rare earth metals are required for any magnetic components.

With one motor driving each axle, the iX xDrive50 and the iX M60 have an electronic version of all-wheel drive as standard.

The new-for-2023 iX M60 develops 610 horsepower and a mighty 811 lb-ft of torque, achieving maximum output in Sport mode and with launch control engaged. Most of the time, a still-impressive 532 horsepower and 749 lb-ft of torque are simmering away under the hood.

Both vehicles have liquid-cooled lithium-ion batteries mounted under the floor. Using a DC fast charger, replenishment from a 10% capacity to 80% can take as little as 35 minutes. Or 90 miles of range can be transmitted in 10 minutes.

Recharging from a domestic outlet takes considerably longer. An 11-kilowatt home setup achieves a full charge in 10.25 hours.

These energy consumption figures from the Environmental Protection Agency might seem a little odd at first, since larger wheels usually mean shorter ranges. But the differences between all-weather tires and performance tires throw an extra factor into the calculations.

“In a new initiative developed in cooperation with the Danish company PLASTIX, the BMW Group is taking the recycling of maritime plastic waste a step further,” reads BMW’s official statement. “After separation, fishing nets and ropes undergo an innovative process that produces plastic granules. While recycled maritime plastic has so far only been used in the automotive industry in the form of fibers for new vehicle components, this recycled material is now also suitable for the injection moulding process for the first time. The raw material for the components manufactured in this way can consist of around 30 percent maritime plastic waste.”

Unraveling the Pacific Garbage Patch

In terms of reducing ocean plastics, recycling commercial fishing ropes is a huge deal – so huge, in fact, that I’m surprised we don’t talk about it more here at CleanTechnica (probably my fault). How huge is “so huge?” At least 46 percent of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch is commercial fishing nets, which multiply themselves by “catching” debris.

“Over three-quarters of the [Great Pacific Garbage Patch] mass was carried by debris larger than 5cm,” reads this study in Nature, which was cited heavily in the Netflix documentary, Seaspiracy. “(And) at least 46% was comprised of fishing nets.”

Creating a market for used commercial fishing nets and ropes, then, could seriously deter the habit of cutting the ropes and leaving them to drift in the ocean when they get tangles. As a raw material, these nets can be proactively sourced at virtually any major port across the world, and measures like these by BMW could ensure that it doesn’t end up as sea trash.

A group from the organization Ultima Generazione entered the Fabbrica del Vapore museum in Milan, Italy where the car is on display. They proceeded to dump several bags of flour on the car before security intervened.

The special BMW looked like it had a light dusting of snow on it, according to Reuters. Two of the protesters are seen on video being dragged away from the display. A report from Art News states the protesters originally planned to stick themselves to the windows, but it didn't work. That report also shows four protesters sitting on the ground next to the car. It's unknown if the flour caused any damage to the M1's special 13-pound paint job.

The car was painted by Warhol in 1979 and raced at Le Mans that year. BMW has commissioned many art cars over the years, but this M1 is arguably the best-known due to its connection with the famous pop artist. Warhol was known for bright colors and sweeping brush strokes, and this particular M1 certainly delivers on that front. In a 2019 feature on the car, BMW quoted Warhol as saying he ""attempted to show speed as a visual image. When an automobile is really traveling fast, all the lines and colors are transformed into a blur.""

Principle BMW and MINI of San Antonio is one of only 3 out of 370 dealerships in the nation to be recognized for its ongoing commitment to environmental and conservation stewardship by BMW North America.

The Excellence in Sustainability Award highlights best practices at dealerships across three key areas: Reducing CO2 emissions (use of renewable energy); Driving electrification (activities to promote electric mobility); and the Circular economy (recycling activities within dealership operations).

Principle BMW and MINI of San Antonio is committed to the Principle Automotive Group’s purpose, “To be a trusted and caring friend helping people move through life in a sustainable way.” In January of 2021, Principle Auto flipped the switch on a solar panel array to reduce its carbon foot print and CO2 emissions. With nearly 2,700 panels, it is one of the largest arrays on an automobile dealership in the United States. This solar power array produces more than 1.2 million kilowatt hours each year to offset 40-70% of the dealership’s electricity consumption. The BMW of North America award recognized its San Antonio dealership and Principle Automotive Group as a leader in sustainability not only in San Antonio, but in the entire North America region.

Project Statistics and Environmental Impact:

Array Physical Size: 70,000sq/ft+

Percentage of Energy Offset: 40% - 70%

This array offsets 2,000,000 lbs. of carbon each year.

It’s the amount of carbon sequestered by 1,200 acres of U.S. forests each year, or 15,000 tree seedlings grown for 10 years.

“Our Dealers throughout North America are powerful ambassadors to further strengthen the BMW brand image as a sustainability leader, and with many dealers already featuring initiatives that go above and beyond, we want to highlight their impact on our commitment to sustainability,” said Sebastian Mackensen, President and CEO, BMW NA. “More than ever, consumers are seeking to do business with brands and retail locations that share their values, and this recognition will help dealerships put a spotlight on their sustainability initiatives.”

According to Abigail Kampmann, CEO and Co-Founder of Principle Auto Group, “As a company, we are more conscience than ever before of the impact we have as a business and responsible member of the community. This project represents Principle Automotive Group’s commitment to the San Antonio community to make an investment to reduce our carbon foot print and CO2 emissions for many years into the future. We will also begin installation of solar panels at our corporate headquarter offices and at Principle Volvo Cars San Antonio in 2023.”

The groups have collectively posted over 400 billboards to bring the automakers' deceit to light.

This comes as no surprise since Toyota has been at it for some time, even getting in some hot water in the past for its misleading claims about its electric vehicles that don't need to be plugged in. They're just traditional hybrids with a gas engine and tailpipe emissions, though Toyota insists it's helping to combat climate change more than other automakers.

Electrek points out that BMW and Toyota are working to promote electric cars while also lobbying against them. These companies hope to continue producing gas cars well into the future, though their public posts often aim to tell a different story.

Last year, InfluenceMap ranked Toyota as the 10th worst company in the world when it comes to anti-climate lobbying. BMW didn't fare much better, landing at number 16 in the ranking. Brandalism writes that in 2021, just 0.2% of Toyota's car sales were EVs. The brand did bring a fully electric SUV to market in 2022 – the bZ4x – but it was recalled almost immediately due to a chance the wheels could fall off, and sales have been minimal.

BMW has been producing fully electric cars for years and enjoyed notable success with the iconic i3. However, many of its offerings that followed were simply emissions-spewing plug-in hybrid electric versions of existing gas-powered models. Since then, the brand has started to release a series of EVs, such as the iX and i4, but it's also still heavily invested in its gas-powered cars, many of which would be considered gas guzzlers due to their high fuel consumption.

Artists and activists at Brandalism, which is based in the UK, posted the following thread on Twitter, which brings together 10 posts that highlight various billboards, images, and stories related to the cause:

As you can see, Brandalism shares that some 400 car billboards have been ""hacked and replaced in 14 cities."" Be sure to click on the tweets embedded above to see the full thread.

The group of activists is going so far as to ask government leaders to bring forth ""tobacco-style"" advertising bans on projects that are harmful to the environment. More specifically, they believe the government should be actively pointing out that large, gas-guzzling SUVs are a detriment and that automakers shouldn't be advocating for them and making plans to continue producing and selling them for many more decades to come.

While the majority of automakers have latched onto all-electric vehicles, hydrogen seems to be the way forward as the cleaner of the two alternative fuels. BMW believes now is the time to explore the world of hydrogen-powered cars, as it’s starting to produce a new iX5 Hydrogen SUV.

BMW claims that the upcoming iX5 Hydrogen is a “small-series” vehicle, which we’re taking to mean it is a limited model. The SUV will be available as a “technology demonstrator for locally carbon-free mobility” in a few regions starting next spring. Seeing BMW come out with a new hydrogen-powered SUV may confuse some people, but the German brand believes that hydrogen will become crucial for it to meet its emissions goals and commitment to the Paris Climate Agreement.

“Hydrogen is a versatile energy source that has a key role to play as we progress towards climate neutrality,” said Frank Weber Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, Development. “We are certain that hydrogen is set to gain significantly in importance for individual mobility and therefore consider a mixture of battery and fuel cell electric drive systems to be a sensible approach in the long term.”

Unlike pure electric vehicles, hydrogen-powered cars, don’t require lithium, cobalt, or nickel, claims Weber. This makes them far friendlier to the planet to produce since they don’t need a massive battery pack with loads of materials that need to be mined, and it allows BMW to stick to building vehicles on its own more. Plus, fuel cell vehicles only emit water vapor.

BMW will be building the iX5 Hydrogen at a plant at its Munich Research and Innovation Center. The SUV features a hydrogen fuel-cell system with an electric battery and an electric motor that make a combined output of 374 horsepower, which is routed through the rear wheels. This makes the iX5 Hydrogen nearly as powerful as the X5 xDrive45e PHEV SUV, which has 389 horsepower. Fun fact: the fuel cells in the SUV are from Toyota, who has been co-developing fuel cells with BMW.

With BMW set only to produce a very small number of iX5 Hydrogen SUVs, these SUVs are more like test vehicles for the brand. But they’ll represent BMW’s most serious hydrogen-powered test vehicles since the 7-Series from the 2000s and the 5-Series GT Hydrogen from 2015. Depending on how the tests go, we could see a production model on sale, though the chances of it coming to the U.S. are slim.

According to data from the U.S. Department of Energy, there are 53 hydrogen charging stations in California and one in Hawaii – that’s it. It’s far more likely that BMW will offer the iX5 Hydrogen as a Europe-only vehicle, as the continent has 375,000 hydrogen chargers as of 2021.

The carmaker aims to reduce carbon emissions from the supply chain by 20% per vehicle by 2030 (compared to 2019). To help reach that goal it is looking at a number of packaging initiatives, including the use of alternative sustainable materials, reducing single-use packaging and introducing lightweight packaging.

BMW said it will increase the proportion of recycled material in reusable packaging for logistics to more than 35% for newly awarded contracts.

“For the individual types of packaging, an individual percentage is agreed upon allocation, depending on geometry and material type,” a spokesperson told Automotive Logistics. “On average, our target for 2022 is more than 35%. There are types of packaging where we have no recyclate, for others we have more than 90%.”

Packaging and material suppliers

The carmaker is working with packaging suppliers on a number of initiatives, including the use of recycled material in containers made of expanded polypropylene (EPP), which can be adapted in shape to the components being packaged. BMW uses 360,000 of these containers annually and they are currently made using 25% recycled material, which saves almost 280 tons of CO2 a year, according to the company.

The EPP containers were piloted and introduced with material supplier JSP and Jacob, an EPP container manufacturer, but BMW said that any of its approximately 10 EPP manufacturers can use the material in series production.

BMW said it plans to increase the proportion of recycled material in the EPP further and the first pilot schemes with 100% recycled material are currently underway. The company said that if the tests are successful, the recycled containers could become standard for new contracts from 2024.

It also said it is launching pilot projects using bio-based materials to replace oil-based polyethylene and polypropylene (PE and PP).

“We are also investigating whether and in what ways we can use materials from recycled household appliances in our packaging,” said the company in a statement. “In the long term, our aim is to use alternatives to raw materials across the board.”

Reducing resources

The efforts being made in packaging are part of an overarching circular strategy at BMW based on the four principles: rethink, reduce, reuse and recycle.

“Our ‘rethink, reduce, reuse, recycle’ approach is being implemented consistently in packaging logistics,” said Michael Nikolaides, head of production network and logistics, BMW Group. “We’re using innovative strategies to consistently reduce the volume of resources we use, thus reducing our carbon footprint.”

Among those innovative strategies is the use of folding load carriers. This year BMW is going to start using folding plastic pallet containers made from 90% recycled material, an alternative to the steel pallet cages it has traditionally used. Following the involvement of several suppliers during the development phase, series production is being carried out by Cabka Group in Berlin.

When empty, the containers can be folded and moved more easily, reducing the transport capacity needed for returns. BMW said that using 15,000 of these containers reduces CO2 by around 3,000 tons per year.

Additionally, BMW said that through the use of small load carriers wit 50% recycled contents and the use of covers, a further 680 tons of carbon emissions savings were possible every year.

The container cover is a standard component for load units that consist of several packaging components, eg. euro pallets, plus small load carriers and covers. The cover is necessary to protect components, ensure safe transport and enable the loaded units to be stacked.

“Several different small load carriers (with different dimensions) are used as standard containers at BMW,” said its spokesperson. “These are part of the load units. In small load carriers, various components or parts are transported from suppliers to BMW sites.”

The carmaker said that the measures it was taking to make packaging more sustainable was focused within Europe at the moment because of available recycling infrastructure but it is currently working towards expanding the strategy to Mexico, the US and China.",BMW to increase recycled packaging as part of sustainability drive

The next generation of power unit will be moving to fully sustainable fuel and place more of a focus on the ERS [energy recovery system] to generate power, as part of the sport’s aim to go fully carbon neutral by 2030.

These new engines will still be capable of the 1000bhp which the current power units produce, and this move along with Formula 1’s increased popularity has already attracted both Audi and Ford to join the sport through Sauber and Red Bull respectively, along with Honda being on the entry list as a power unit supplier – though they do not currently have a customer team.

But BMW, who were involved in Formula 1 as an engine supplier with Williams in the early 2000s before combining with Sauber to have their own team until 2009, have not been swayed to make a return to the grid.

For Roos, head of BMW’s M Motorsport division, he explained that the technology Formula 1 is looking to implement is already on show for BMW in their efforts in endurance racing worldwide.

With that, they feel the company is in the right place with their motorsport portfolio, and do not need to re-enter Formula 1.

“When we’re honest, Formula 1 goes hybrid 2026, they are at the moment already but with a hybrid system which has no relevance at all,” Roos told Speedcafe.com.

HOW IS YOUR SUPPLY LINE OF NEW VEHICLES

The higher cost of fuels has encouraged drivers to consider making the switch to electrified plug-in hybrid or fully electric cars, so demand has outweighed supply.

We are looking forward to 2023 where we will have eight fully electric cars on sale in Ireland, plus 11 plug-in hybrid models, including our new flagship BMW i7, iX1 and BMW XM and 7 Series 750e xDrive plug-in hybrids.

HOW IS BMW POSITIONED IN THE HYBRID AND ELECTRIC VEHICLE SEGMENTS?

BMW and MINI are leading in electrified in the premium segment in 2022. Close to 50% of our sales are a combination of fully electric and plug-in hybrid models, and we expect this trend to continue. At a global level, by 2030 at least half of the BMW Group's vehicle deliveries are set to be fully electric cars.

WHAT TRENDS HAVE YOU NOTED ABOUT CAR BUYER PREFERENCES?

Sustainability is more than just driving electric. We firmly believe that the future of our planet demands a circular economy, and this means modifying the design process, using resources in a highly efficient manner, and closing material loops.

We aim to increase the proportion of secondary material in our vehicles from almost 30% today to up to 50% going forward, in keeping with the motto ‘Secondary First’.

WHAT WAS BMW’S MOST POPULAR MODEL IN 2022?

The BMW 5 Series, which has an enduring connection with customers in Ireland. It comes in a variety of drivetrains and we will welcome the first fully electric i5 soon. For MINI, our most popular model has been the MINI Hatch, which provides customers with lots of choice and is competitively priced from €30,365.

Kevin Davidson describes the BMW iX as a vision of the future

WHICH EXECUTIVE MODEL DO YOU RECOMMEND?

Ove the past year I have been lucky to drive the BMW iX, a vision of the future. With its trailblazing design and an interior devoted to luxurious spaciousness, the BMW iX embodies a fresh new take on an executive car.

The BMW iX xDrive50 comes with a range of up to 630km (WLTP), and what is more outstanding is the high proportion of secondary aluminium and reused plastic that contribute to minimising the natural resources in its production.

Inside the iX, FSC-certified wood, leather tanned with olive leaf extracts, and other natural materials are used. Both the vehicle itself and the battery cells are manufactured using green power, and the BMW Group procures the cobalt and lithium required for the high-voltage batteries from controlled sources as well. [CLCUI1]

WHAT NEW MODELS ARE ON THE WAY FROM BMW IN 2023?

We will welcome three new electric models, including the flagship fully electric BMW i7, the mid-sized SUV BMW iX1, which will come in electric, plug-in hybrid, petrol and diesel, plus the sporty plug-in hybrid BMW XM.

WHAT IS YOUR VIEW ON CAR BUYER SENTIMENT?

We are expecting the new car market to grow in 2023 because Ireland has a strong economy and labour market. In an unpredictable market, maintaining government incentives around electric vehicles will help the transition to electric vehicle driving and meet our targets by 2030 to have one million EVs on the road.

It’s not often that an automaker encourages motorists to keep their old car meticulously maintained for extended longevity but a BMW boss has made these bold claims in the face of sustainability.

Consumerism is what the modern world has been built on. It is what the automotive world finds itself guilty of, as well as every other conceivable industry that creates products for the purchase by the public. Innovations and technology in the realm of the automobile are ushered in on a frequent basis and this forms the grounds for automakers to deem aging models as obsolete. Employing the latest technology into new models ensures manufacturers can retain a competitive edge but it also fosters a nature of discarding products well before their intended use has been achieved.

Related: Old car, new tricks: a look at aftermarket infotainment systems

It is another reason why automakers have a significantly bloated portfolio of models pandering to every need of every consumer, making upsizing or downsizing easier than ever before. The resources, time and raw material required to produced a new vehicle are immense and are a great contributor to environmental waste and thus, the age old argument presents itself: is an older car more sustainable than a tech-heavy new model?

Monika Dernai, head of sustainability for BMW seems to think so. Recently presenting her opinions to a panel in London, the BMW boss claims that keeping an old car could be a significant factor in reducing environmental impact and waste, from its creation to its disposal. This controvesrial statement in the wake of consumerism will undoubtedly face criticism from industry peers but the logic is sound.

Dernai stated: “We really need to think about prolonging the life of cars; not having a used car market where you sell cars to each other, but maybe take a car and extend its lifespan.” This is a concept that has been around for years and Dernai believes the solution is this: “The idea could be that you could freshen up the interior. We need new skill sets in the aftermarket and to design cars so that the seat can be removed and a fresh seat can be moved in – then it’s a used car that looks like a new car.”

This is something that petrolheads rever the thought of, giving a second chance to an older, classic car and having OEM backing would help to increase and broaden the appeal to other motorists. Second to safety and performance, older cars tend to lack technology that increases the appeal of modern cars. Retrofitting updated infotainment systems, installing heated seats and a panoramic sunroof with factory finishes are a few things that could make this an industry worth getting off the ground.","Keep your old car, its better for the environment according to BMW"

A press release from the BMW Group noted that the main growth drivers in 2023 will be fully-electric (BEV) vehicles and models from the high-end premium segment, such as the new BMW 7 Series, the updated BMW X7 and the Rolls-Royce model family.

Oliver Zipse, Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG, said, 'With our strong BEV growth, we are leaving established competitors far behind. Our BEVs also make a vital contribution to achieving further, tangible reductions in the CO2 emissions of our EU new vehicle fleet. At 105.0 grams of CO2 per kilometre in the WLTP cycle, we even outperformed the EU27+2 fleet target by 22.5 grams per kilometre by the end of 2022. '

In this upper segment, the group expects growth in the mid-double-digit percentage range for the current financial year, with BEV models even likely to grow in the high double-digit percentage range. Overall, it expects its deliveries to customers worldwide to increase slightly in the automotive segment in 2023.

Interestingly, in the past year, the group more than doubled its BEV sales to over 215,000 units, better than its direct European competitors and significantly more than most Asian and US new entry players.

In the first two months of the year, it was able to more than double its sales of fully-electric vehicles compared to the same period of the previous year. Growth was disproportionately strong in China, where the company's BEV sales more than tripled in the year to the end of February.

Regarding sales growth for fully-electric vehicles, the group noted that not only are the company’s existing customers switching to vehicles with fully-electric drive trains, but customers from other brands, in particular, are also opting for its BEV models. In this way, the company intends to continue to gain market share.

With the launch of the new 5 Series and the fully-electric i5 this year, the group will have a BEV offering in virtually every major segment of its business. The range will be rounded out at the end of the year by the fully-electric iX2 and an absolute first next year when the very first fully-electric touring model will make its debut in the 5 Series.

The Mini

The Mini brand is on its way to a fully electric future from the beginning of the 2030s. The first electric vehicles in the new Mini family are due to be launched on the market this year. Production of the new Countryman will also begin in 2023 at its plant in Leipzig.

Rolls-Royce

In 2030, the Rolls-Royce brand will also have an exclusively all-electric offering – starting with the first all-electric Spectre, which celebrated its world premiere in 2022, with the first vehicles delivered to customers this year.

With its range of around a dozen fully electric models already on offer, the group anticipates a steep growth trajectory in the coming years. In 2024, at least one in five of the company’s new cars will have a fully-electric drive train, while by 2025, every fourth new vehicle delivered should be a BEV and, by 2026, around one in three.

BMW Motorrad already relies solely on e-drives in urban settings. Following the CE 04, the CE 02 is mainly designed to appeal to young people living in the city. Today's perfect customer experience also entails personalised communication with customers in the worlds they live in, he said.

The group aims to exceed 10 million fully-electric vehicles delivered to customers by 2030. An important milestone on this journey is expected in 2025 when the milestone of two million fully electric vehicles is likely to be passed.

Interestingly, R&D costs in accordance with IFRS totalled € 6,624 million, which is 5.2% YoY up, mainly driven by new models, the NEUE KLASSE and the associated development of the sixth generation of electric drive trains.

As all markets worldwide will not have the necessary framework conditions for all customers to switch to pure electro-mobility in the next decade, a growing percentage of the drive train mix is also likely to be provided by hydrogen fuel cells from the second half of this decade.

In the first quarter of 2023, a pilot series of the iX5 Hydrogen was presented for the first time, and the fleet is now being used internationally for demonstration and testing purposes for various target groups.

Interestingly, the hydrogen required to supply the fuel cell in the iX5 Hydrogen is stored in two 700-bar tanks made of carbon fibre-reinforced plastic (CFRP). Together, they contain six kilograms of hydrogen, which gives the vehicle a claimed range of 504 km in the WLTP cycle. It only takes three to four minutes to fill up the hydrogen tanks.

Zipse believes that BMW iFACTORY is the future for its global production network. The group has been expanding this concept in all major regions of the world; it completed two key projects in China last year.

'In 2023, our strategic approach will once again keep us on track for success. We will meet current requirements with our fresh, technologically broad product line-up and with our operational excellence. At the same time, we will remain focused on our course for the future,' Zipse added.

BERLIN, Sept 21 (Reuters) - German activists have filed a lawsuit against automakers BMW and Daimler for refusing to tighten carbon emissions goals, the first time German citizens have sued private companies for exacerbating climate change. read more

The lawsuit from the heads of Deutsche Umwelthilfe (DUH), a non-governmental organisation (NGO), is similar to one being lined up for Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) by the heads of Greenpeace's Germany division in collaboration with Fridays for Future activist Clara Mayer and an unidentified landowner. However, this group has given Volkswagen until Oct. 29 to respond.

DUH also challenged energy firm Wintershall (WINT.UL) to restrict its emissions targets, but no suit has been filed against the company as of yet.

Here's what the cases mean, and why they matter.

WHERE HAS THIS COME FROM?

In May last year, Germany's top court ruled the country's climate law was not doing enough to protect future generations. It set carbon emissions budgets for major economic sectors, increased the percentage by which emissions must be reduced from 1990 levels by 2030 to 65% from 55%, and stated that Germany as a country must be carbon-neutral by 2045. read more

While meeting these demands implies some restrictions to current generations' lifestyles, not meeting them would force future generations to make significantly more drastic sacrifices in order to both survive in a warmer world, and prevent the problem from getting worse, the court argued at the time.

In the same month, environmental groups in the Netherlands won a case against oil company Shell for not doing enough to mitigate its impact on the climate – the first private firm to be ordered by a court to reduce its emissions. read more

On the back of those two rulings, the German activists are making their case.

WHY DOES IT MATTER?

This case is important on two levels.

Firstly, because of the legal precedent it could set - namely, that companies are directly responsible for the effect on people's lives of the emissions their products create.

If the defendants win, citizens could be emboldened to sue other companies – from airlines to retailers to energy firms – for not doing enough to mitigate their impact on the planet.

Secondly, because companies will be forced to prove in court that their emissions targets are as watertight as they say they are – stress-testing their claims that they are taking climate change seriously.

WHY THESE COMPANIES?

Daimler (DAIGn.DE) and BMW (BMWG.DE) have set a number of climate-related targets.

[1/2] An exhaust pipe of a car is pictured on a street in a Berlin, Germany, February 22, 2018. REUTERS/Fabrizio Bensch/File Photo 1 2

Daimler aims to produce purely electric vehicles (EVs) by 2030, and provide an electric alternative for all models by 2025. BMW wants at least half of global sales to be EVs by 2030, and reduce CO2 emissions per vehicle by 40% in the same timeframe. Volkswagen has said it will stop producing fossil fuel-emitting cars by 2035.

All three firms have stated that their targets are in line with the international Paris Agreement on tackling global warming.

But the defendants argue that the companies' goals aren't enough to adhere to the German climate ruling and carbon emissions budgets set by the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC).

By prolonging carbon-emitting activities, the companies are directly responsible for the constraints on individual rights that will have to endured in future if carbon budgets aren't stuck to, the case argues.

These are by no means the only firms to which such an argument could apply - and if DUH wins, more lawsuits could follow.

WHAT DO THEY WANT?

DUH wants both autos firms to legally commit to ending production of fossil fuel-emitting cars by 2030, and to ensure the CO2 emitted by their activities before those deadlines does not go beyond their fair share.

What do they mean by their fair share? It's a complex calculation – but put simply, the NGO has calculated a personal ‘carbon budget’ for each company, based on a figure put together by the IPCC of how much carbon we can still emit globally without warming the Earth beyond 1.7 degrees Celsius, and how much carbon the companies emitted in 2019.

According to its calculations, the companies' current climate goals aren't enough to keep them within their allocated budget – meaning that even if everyone else sticks to their budgets, these companies' activities would push emissions over the limit.

WHAT HAVE THE COMPANIES SAID?

Daimler said on Monday it did not see any grounds for the case. ""We have long provided a clear statement for the path to climate neutrality: it is our aim to be fully electric by the end of the decade - wherever market conditions allow,"" it said in a statement.

BMW said its climate targets were already at the forefront of the industry, and its goals were in line with the ambition of keeping global warming under 1.5 degrees.

Volkswagen said it would consider the case, but that it ""does not view suing individual firms as a suitable method to tackle societal challenges.""

WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?

It's now up to Germany's district court to decide whether the case should be taken forward. If it thinks so, the companies will be asked to present evidence to defend themselves against the charges, and a written debate between the two sides will ensue.

A ruling could be years away. But the longer it takes, the higher the risk to the companies if they lose - as they could be left with very little time left to meet any court demands by 2030.

The BMW Group is the first automotive manufacturer worldwide to use matt paints made from biomass instead of crude oil at its European plants. In addition to this, BMW Group Plants Leipzig and Rosslyn (South Africa) are also using sustainably-produced corrosion protection.

The BMW Group has chosen to use BASF Coatings’ CathoGuard 800 ReSource e-coat at its plants in Leipzig, Germany, and Rosslyn, South Africa, and the iGloss matt ReSource clearcoat throughout Europe. Using these more sustainable product versions for vehicle coatings enables CO 2 avoidance of around 40% per coating layer; this will reduce the amount of CO 2 emitted in the plants by more than 15,000 metric tons by 2030.

The BMW Group produces an average of around 250,000 vehicles every year at its plants in Leipzig and Rosslyn.

As a corrosion protection technology with optimum protection of edges, the CathoGuard 800 e-coat helps millions of cars live longer. Its biomass-balanced version, CathoGuard 800 ReSource, adds a reduced carbon footprint to the e-coat application’s material efficiency, without changing the product’s formulation.

BASF’s innovative production process makes it possible to replace petroleum-based precursors, such as naphtha, with renewable raw materials from organic waste, starting in the early stages of paint production. This not only reduces consumption of fossil resources, but also avoids the CO 2 emissions associated with the production, transport and processing of crude oil.

The corrosion protection and matt paints used at BMW Group Plants Leipzig and Rosslyn are chemically identical to the paints previously used, with all the same properties as conventionally manufactured body coatings. Since bio-based and conventional coatings are produced on the same line, BASF adopts an externally certified mass balance approach.

The amount of paint purchased by the BMW Group is calculated to be exactly equivalent to the amount of bio-naphtha and bio-methane that would be required for 100% petroleum-free production.",BMW Group using sustainable BASF paints made from bio-waste

IN THE automotive aftersales industry, waste products are unavoidable and over the years, the more responsible companies have ensured that the waste products are properly disposed and do not damage the environment. Local authorities also have strict regulations to ensure that waste products like used oil do not get into the public drainage system. One of the companies which has stepped up its efforts in this area of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) is BMW Group Malaysia which recently commemorated their partnership with Pentas Flora in a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU).

As part of BMW Group Malaysia’s RE:GENERATE programme to adopt circularity within the organisation, this collaboration with Pentas Flora is a crucial first step to ensuring not only proper automotive waste management, but also a firm departure from the traditional linear approach to valuable resources. The goal is to achieve 100% participation in repurposing used oils and lubricants from all BMW dealers nationwide, while also encouraging more industry players to pay closer attention to waste management, ensuring that waste is no longer carelessly deposited into landfills, incinerated, or illegally dumped. The initiative actually started in 2021 when BMW Group Financial Services Malaysia collaborated with Pentas Flora as a sustainability partner. The internal initiative with the local BMW dealer network was intended to give waste oils and lubricants collected from their service centres a second life as re-refined eco-base oils. Since then, over 30,000 litres of waste oils and lubricants have been collected from 4 participating BMW dealerships in the Klang Valley. These products have been sent for processing at Pentas Flora’s re-refinery plant in Banting, Selangor to eventually be turned into re-refined eco base oil that will be channelled back into the automotive sector once again.

Re-refined oil is a complex but highly reliable product that goes through vacuum distillation, pre-treatment processes such as sieving, dewatering, vacuum dehydration, short path distillation, and a variety of treatment processes to obtain a quality end-product comparable to virgin base oil. “For us at BMW Group Malaysia, our vision for sustainability is clear. In all our efforts to mitigate climate change, we ensure our strategy is both Circular and Responsible – as we pursue a verifiable and consistent path towards climate neutrality by 2050. In doing so, we drive forward the Group’s global ambition here with a local context, while inspiring more Malaysian industry leaders to place ESG at the forefront of their decision-making in 2023,” said Hans de Visser, Managing Director of BMW Group Malaysia.",BMW Group Malaysia and Pentas Flora sign MoU to recycle used oil from service centres

BMW said Tuesday it had started to source and use aluminum that has been produced using solar energy, a move the German carmaker described as ""an important milestone"" in its goal to cut carbon dioxide emissions from its supply network.

A ""triple-digit million-euro contract"" will see Emirates Global Aluminium (EGA), an industrial firm based in the United Arab Emirates, provide BMW with 43,000 metric tons of aluminum this year.

BMW said EGA was the first business in the world to utilize solar electricity for commercial aluminum production.

The solar power used in the metal's production process will come from the Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park, a vast development located in desert south of Dubai. The aluminum will then be processed and turned into car parts at the light metal foundry of BMW's plant in Landshut, Germany.

The ""solar aluminium"" sourced from the UAE will account for almost half of the yearly requirements of the Landshut foundry, according to BMW.

The deal announced Tuesday is part of a wider ""long-term"" strategy to source aluminum produced from renewables, which BMW says could save roughly 2.5 million metric tons of CO2 by the year 2030.

Shift to electric

BMW's move comes as the firm — and other major car companies — attempts to ramp up its electric vehicle offering and challenge Elon Musk's Tesla .

While electric vehicles have an advantage over diesel or gasoline when it comes to tailpipe emissions, there are clear challenges related to their manufacture.

In its announcement Tuesday, BMW acknowledged this: ""The trend towards e-mobility means that a much larger percentage of a vehicle's lifecycle CO2 emissions now comes from upstream added value in the supplier network,"" it said.

""In an electrified vehicle, CO2 emissions from the use phase are much lower, but producing battery cells or aluminium is very energy-intensive,"" it added.

Aluminum is seen as being particularly important going forward because, as BMW noted, its lightweight properties enable it to partially offset the heavy weight of batteries.

Using renewables to 'green' supply chains

The news of BMW's plan to source aluminum produced using solar power comes a day after it was announced a turbine production plant owned by energy giant Vestas would be powered using an environmentally friendly source of gas.

In a statement Monday Earth Capital said its portfolio company, Black Dog Biogas, would send power to the Vestas factory, which manufactures blades for offshore wind turbines. Both sites are located on the Isle of Wight, off the south coast of the U.K..

The Black Dog plant is able to provide enough power to meet roughly 80% of the Vestas factory's requirements.",BMW will now use aluminum that's been made with solar power

On the front end, BMW aims to consume fewer resources, improving “not only ecological but also economic sustainability” given commodity prices will continue to increase as resources become more scarce.

BMW is targeting the use of recycled and secondary materials to cut back on resource consumption. Currently, the German automaker is “using almost 30% recycled and reusable materials” but “plans to successively raise this figure to 50%.”

With this step, BMW is signaling its commitment to climate targets including the Paris Agreement’s 1.5-degree Celsius warming cap and the EU’s Fit for 55 goal of reducing emissions by 55% by 2030.

The centerpiece of BMW’s initiative is its revamped Neue Klasse vehicle line. Originally introduced in the 1960s, the reimagined Neue Klasse will consist of materials-efficient, all-electric vehicles with a scheduled availability date of 2025. BMW plans to put ten million electric vehicles on the road within ten years, anticipating that by 2030, “at least half of global BMW Group sales will be all-electric vehicles, with the MINI brand offering exclusively all-electric.” However, in contrast to automakers such as GM, Volvo, and Jaguar, who are working toward a complete phase-out of their gas-powered vehicles, BMW stated that it will be using “innovation, rather than any overall ban on individual technologies” as its sustainability strategy.

To this end, BMW will be partnering with ALBA and BASF to increase the recycling rate of its vehicle plastics. First, Alba will conduct end-of-life analyses of BMW’s vehicles to establish whether a car-to-car reuse of the plastic is possible. BASF will then “assess whether chemical recycling of the pre-sorted waste can be used in order to obtain pyrolysis oil, [which] can be used as a basis for new products made of plastic.” Providing an example, BMW suggested that “in the future, a new door trim or other components could be manufactured from a used instrument panel.”

Board Chairman Oliver Zipse summarized BMW’s intent with the new effort, stating, “How companies are dealing with CO2 emissions has become a major factor when it comes to judging corporate action. The decisive factor in the fight against global warming is how strongly we can improve the carbon footprint of vehicles over their entire life span. This is why we are setting ourselves transparent and ambitious goals for the substantial reduction of CO2 emissions; these are validated by the Science Based Targets Initiative and will deliver an effective and measurable contribution.”",BMW Tees Up to Become Carbon Neutral With Deep Emission Cuts

If that doesn’t work, the pocketbook angle should do the trick, considering the high cost of gas. That might explain why BMW North America has just announced a free new EV charging program to sweeten the pot. The juice-on-the-house deal could also encourage BMW customers to buy larger EVs, which doesn’t sound particularly eco-friendly, but BMW has that side at least partly covered through its new low carbon steel initiatives.

Free EV Charging & Many Charging Stations To Choose From

BMW developed the new electric vehicle charging program through Electrify America, which is well known as the award winning builder of the largest open ultra-fast DC charging network in the US. According to the company, their chargers can be used by “almost every electric vehicle on the road today.”

The numbers are piling up. Electrify America launched in 2018 and averages 4 charging station installations weekly. The company is a couple of months behind its 2021 goal of 800 charging stations with 3,500 ultra fast chargers, but it is closing in fast. The latest count is 710 stations and 114 in development.

BMW buyers who shell out for a 2022 BMW electric vehicle will get two years of 30-minute free EV charging sessions at all Electrify America charging stations, starting with the day of purchase.

“The program will launch with the sale of the new all-electric BMW iX xDrive50, BMW i4 eDrive40 and BMW i4 M50 in March. With no additional cost to the vehicle’s purchase price, customers will immediately have access to complimentary charging at more than 3,000 Electrify America chargers across the U.S.” Electrify America explains.

According to Electrify America, iX and i4 drivers can expect to collect charges lasting between 90 and 108 miles in as little as 10 minutes, respectively.

Low Carbon Steel For The Green Electric Vehicle Of The Future

Electrify America also noted that additional models and benefits will be announced shortly.

More to the point, the company enthused that that its ultra-fast EV chargers will enable drivers to “charge up even the largest BMW all-electric vehicles with ease.” That’s all well and good, except that larger vehicles generally mean more steel, which raises all kinds of issues over the use of fossil energy at steel mills.

Not to worry. The global steel industry is beginning to leverage the green hydrogen trend to replace fossil fuels at steel mills. The idea is to run the mills with hydrogen sourced from renewable or sustainable resources, which could include water, biomass, biogas, and municipal wastewater, as well as ordinary water. Industrial sources are also in the mix, including waste gases and waste plastic, but the main focus is on leveraging renewable energy to push hydrogen gas out of water.

That’s a huge development, considering that the primary source of hydrogen today is natural gas, with coal coming in second. Fossil stakeholders are scrambling to keep up by attaching carbon capture to their hydrogen production systems, but the green hydrogen market is growing at a ferocious pace and the prospects for catching up are slim.

BMW’s Big Green Hydrogen Adventure

BMW is careful to position its new European steel initiative as a low-carbon program, not a zero carbon program. That’s a wise move, because the company apparently allows some wiggle room for natural gas as well as green hydrogen.

“The BMW Group continues to reduce CO 2 emissions in its supplier network as part of its ambitious ongoing sustainability activities. Steel produced using natural gas or hydrogen and green power, instead of fossil resources like coal, makes a vital contribution to this,” BMW explains.

Actually, that looks like a translation slip-up, since natural gas is a fossil resource, not an “instead of” fossil resource. In any case, BMW should take another look at that natural gas angle. On top of that thing about killing the planet with methane emissions, pressure is building for another all-out war in Europe against the backdrop of the region’s dependence on gas from Russia, with a winter gas shortage and Russia’s newly built but yet-to-be-operational Nordstream II gas pipeline to Germany adding a heavy dose of geopolitics to the mix.

On a brighter note, BMW’s latest low carbon steel announcement tips the scales in favor of green hydrogen, through a new contract with the steelmaker Salzgitter AG. Just a few years ago Salzgitter was considering natural gas for reducing the carbon footprint of its mills, but more recently the company has turned its attention to green hydrogen.

In addition, last fall BMW signed an agreement with the Swedish startup H2 Green Steel, a company that focuses exclusively on green hydrogen.

“Together, the two agreements will supply over 40% of the steel required by the company’s European plants and save around 400,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions per year,” BMW Group explains, noting that its European press plants process more than half a million tonnes of steel per year.

More Green Hydrogen For EV Charging Stations

In a related angle, the idea of using green hydrogen to power EV charging stations is beginning to take hold. The idea would be to deploy electricity-generating hydrogen fuel cells for EV charging stations that don’t have easy access to the grid, but are accessible by road, waterway, or pipeline.

Powering remote EV charging stations with solar arrays or distributed wind energy is an alternative, but fuel cells could be a better fit in enough cases to build a market.

The Extreme E racing organization has been promoting the idea. Launched in 2021 as sister organization to Alejandro Agog’s Formula E circuit, Extreme E aims at proving electric vehicle technology in harsh environments. That includes charging station access, which explains why Extreme E settled on the fuel cell company AFC Energy to provide its alkaline fuel cells for the EV charging end of things.

AFC is already engaged with the green hydrogen trend and the company could have green ammonia in its sights as well. AFC is on board for the 2022 Extreme E event so stay tuned for more on that.

As for fuel cell electric vehicles, BMW is among the many automakers dipping a toe in those waters. Most of the attention nowadays is focusing on heavy duty applications, including aircraft as well as trucks and locomotives.

Despite challenges in the fuel cell passenger car area, BMW has been moving forward with its BMW iX5 Hydrogen car — but with an important green caveat.

“Provided the hydrogen is produced using renewable energy and the necessary infrastructure is available, this technology can complement the BMW Group’s electrified drive train portfolio — and, in particular, meet the needs of customers who do not have their own access to electric charging infrastructure, frequently drive long distances or desire a high degree of flexibility,” the company explained in a press release last August (emphasis added).

If all goes according to plan, fuel cell EVs could carve out space in BMW’s zero emission portfolio, so stay tuned for more on that.

The phrase “as the seasons change” has taken a whole new meaning in the past few years, as the seasons really do feel like they’re different now – wetter, hotter, drier, somewhere in the world seems to be constantly in crisis on any given day.

As the issue of climate change heats up, it’s natural to ask “are we doing enough” and, on World EV Day in particular, will switching to EVs be enough to reduce the CO2 emissions produced by the world’s cars?

Reducing the tailpipe emissions of a car to zero, as the EV revolution has, is a great start, but obviously, the way we build those cars, and the way we reuse the materials that were used to create them, is going to have to change as well.

The world’s biggest car companies know this and the next EV-olution is all about CO2-neutral factories and even the goal of building a vehicle that is totally climate neutral.

BMW CONTENT HUB: Is plug-in hybrid technology a better solution than EV for right now?

BMW CONTENT HUB: Think all EVs are equally green? Think again

At the other end of a car’s life, though, what happens to all those elements that come together to build a vehicle? Can they be reused, recycled, repurposed?

This is the idea of the circular economy, a future in which we don’t waste so much, and we create vehicles that are not only made from 100 per cent recyclable materials, but 100 per cent recyclable at the end of their lives as well.

BMW i-Vision Circular concept

Or what if they didn’t have to have an “end” as such. BMW is one company that’s putting forward the idea of a “perpetual mobility device”, a vehicle that you can just pop parts off – doors, bonnets, whatever – then recycle the old and replace them with new ones.

BMW has already come up with just such a car in the alluringly modern and city-focused shape of the i-Vision Circular Concept.

This i-Vision Circular represents the BMW Group’s commitment to becoming the most sustainable manufacturer in the premium space, and making its vehicles a part of the Circular Economy concept, which is all about rethinking, reusing, reducing and recycling.

Every part of the i-Vision Circular has been designed to minimise waste, and weight. Even the BMW logo itself is no longer a plastic badge, it’s been milled into the bonnet.

The badge has been milled into the bonnet to save plastic

This cool concept also looks stunning, despite not using paint, because that’s not always environmentally friendly. Made out of anodised aluminium, it gives off a unique sheen.

The idea of minimising waste in cars is one that BMW’s Head of Design Domagoj Dukec is

passionate about, and he’s particularly proud of the looks, and materials used in, the Vision

Circular.

“So you’ve got real craftsmanship there, it looks more high end, but at the same time you’re doing away with 10 other components – it’s premium, but in a whole new way,” Dukec explains.

Dukec’s aim with interiors like the one found in that concept, and the road-going iX electric SUV, was to strip away what he calls “unnecessary jewellery”, like wood and aluminium, and decorative lines.

He believes the structure itself can be made so attractive that it doesn’t need that “jewellery” on

top.

As Dukec knows, today there are many different customers with widely varying tastes, but he believes designing a BMW that will inspire buyers in markets as diverse as Saudi Arabia, China and Europe comes down to just two things – “wow” and “meaningfulness”.

“What we need at first is an aesthetic attraction, everybody needs that moment, the stunning look, but it’s not like there’s a recipe and you just make it, you have to find out who the customer is for each car, and find out what is the ’wow’ for each, he says.

“But just being wow is not enough, like when you meet a person and you think she looks great, but this is not enough for eternal, long-lasting love, you need something deeper, so you need meaningfulness.”

He firmly believes that sense of meaningfulness is imbued in the iX, with its cool, minimalist aesthetic. The super modern EV represents the sustainable, less-is-more approach BMW is heading towards, after BMW CEO Oliver Zipse declared that his company will make “the greenest” cars on the market.

MIni Aceman

Another fantastic vehicle – and a natural fit for electric technology – is the MINI Concept Aceman, the BMW Group brand’s first ever fully electric crossover SUV.

The Aceman has an electrified go-kart feel and strong focus on a minimal environmental impact, but that green ethos isn’t merely down to a zero-emissions powertrain. There’s much more to sustainability than what doesn’t come out of the exhaust pipe.

The Aceman’s design language, called “charismatic simplicity”, also embodies a sustainable circular economy approach. The look is pared back and the car is devoid of chrome, while the interior concept is trimmed in cool, recycled synthetic fabric.

This future focused Mini, with its LED front end that can light up a digital version of the Union Jack will show a message to its owner as they walk up to unlock it.

And, thanks to its electric powertrain removing the need for big lump of engine up front, the bonnet has been made shorter to provide more space inside the cabin.

The Aceman is a very Mini EV

By the end of 2022 BMW – which is also the parent company of MINI – will have produced 15 new battery electric vehicles. Its aim is that at least half of all the cars it sells will be full EVs before 2030.

It’s hard to imagine now, but you have to wonder whether there’ll even be a need for a World EV Day by the end of this decade. By then, it would just be called World Car Day.",The BMW Group’s 360-degree approach to sustainability

The automaker's 12-cylinder engine, first introduced in 1987 in the original 750iL, set a new benchmark (and challenge) for luxury full-size sedans over 30 years ago, helping spur rival Mercedes to build a twelve of its own. Marking the occasion, the German automaker plans to build a limited series of only 12 of these marvelous machines-all destined for the U.S. And as a proper send-off, Final V12 models will be exclusive to long-established V-12 clients.

This end-of-an-era Bimmer, based on the M760i xDrive, will rely on a twin-turbocharged 6.6-liter V-12 engine rated at 601 hp and 627 lb-ft of torque. An eight-speed automatic directs output to all four wheels, propelling the M760i from zero to 60 mph in 3.6 seconds. Onlookers can distinguish the Final V12 from other 7 Series models by a bold ""V12"" badge at the rear, 20-inch wheels (available in Window Gray or Jet Black), and brake calipers painted either blue or black—but overall the treatment is subtle.

The interior will feature a The Final V12 inscription on the door sills to match the V-12 engine cover and BMW Individual piano black trim surrounds. Final V12s will also come fully equipped, including the Luxury Rear Seating Package, lounge-style panoramic LED roof, BMW's Driving Assistance Professional Package, and Bowers & Wilkins audio system.

The exterior of the one-off converted MINI electric car uses a bright blue exterior shade and a lime green battery box, recalling the 1990s colour palette. The blue shade has been borrowed from the original 1998 MINI Paul Smith Edition - a vehicle that was limited to 1,800 units. The shade of the original vehicle was chosen based on a swatch taken from one of Paul Smith’s favourite shirts.

The interior of the newly designed car borrows elements from the sustainable concept of the MINI Strip. The bodyshell remains bare and unclad floor pan dominates the interior. Rustic floor mats are made of recycled rubber on top. While the elements used are innovative and from resource-saving materials, the design of the interior also out entire instruments in other places. There is a magnet next to the steering wheel for the smartphone, which, apart from the speedometer, replaces almost all the old buttons and functions on the dashboard. Another innovative element is the steering wheel which can be completely removed to facilitate getting in and out of the car.

The premium German carmaker said it would have five fully-electric models available this year, as it races alongside the rest of the industry to roll out new zero-emission models in the face of tightening CO2 emissions targets in Europe and China.

Plant shutdowns in the first half of 2020 to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus led many in the industry to expect a disastrous year, but a market rebound spurred by China helped the industry recover faster than expected.

“Our performance in the second half of the year demonstrated just how strong the BMW Group is ... we soon overcame the impact of weeks of plant closures and nationwide lockdowns,” Chief Executive Oliver Zipse said. “We are starting 2021 revitalised and with a favourable tailwind.”

BMW sales in China rose 7.4% in 2020 versus 2019, mostly offsetting declines in other regions.

Chinese consumers also helped propel BMW’s rival Daimler AG to a full-year pre-tax profit.

Volkswagen AG’s 2020 profit fell less than expected, again with a push from Chinese drivers eager to snap up premium Audi vehicles.

BMW said that, with the exception of the second quarter, it remained profitable throughout 2020.

Investments in electrification, self-driving technology and connectivity meant that research and development costs remained high at 5.7 billion euros ($6.8 billion), though more than 4% below the nearly 6 billion euros the company spent in 2019.

The company cut its other capital expenditures by more than 30% during the year.

The premium carmaker posted a full-year 2020 pre-tax profit of 5.2 billion euros ($6.22 billion), down nearly 27% from 7.2 billion euros in the prior year.

BMW ended the year with free cash flow of 3.4 billion euros, up from 2.6 billion euros in 2019 despite widespread lockdowns.

We found out what it would look like way back in November of 2020, we saw it undergo arctic testing and now, thanks to an announcement made by BMW on Tuesday, we know a little bit more about what's going on under the hood and how it's going to be built.

Specifically, BMW's fifth-generation eDrive technology will produce around 500 horsepower from a dual-motor setup. As configured in the iX xDrive50, the drivetrain should be good for around 300 miles of range, based on BMW's estimates. Not bad, but not groundbreaking either, especially considering that the iX isn't slated to hit dealers until early next year and the EV range arms race is still heating up. We also know that BMW expects the iX xDrive50 to retail somewhere in the mid-$80,000 range, which would put it in contention with Tesla's Model S and Porsche's Taycan -- two tough competitors.

Perhaps more important than the iX's performance facts and figures or even its price is the way that BMW is going to build the thing with an eye focused heavily on sustainability. BMW will start this process off by using clean energy sources to power the factories that produce the iX and its battery pack. This, in combination with using a greater percentage of recycled materials (BMW claims that each iX will use 132 pounds of recycled plastic in total), should add up to an 18% reduction in carbon emissions, according to BMW.

BMW is pushing hard for the use of materials in the iX that are not only made from recycled materials, but which are recyclable themselves. BMW

It doesn't stop there, though. BMW is reevaluating the way it buys materials and components for the iX so that its purchasing is done with a focus on human rights, respect for environmental standards and carbon output reduction. BMW is also considering the impact the iX will have at the end of its service life by ensuring as much of the vehicle as possible is recyclable.

BMW is also getting deep into materials testing -- but not just for strength or durability. It's also looking at the health and safety impact its materials choices will have on buyers. An example is trying to keep commonly allergenic materials like nickel isolated from drivers and passengers.

This kind of profound reevaluation of how it goes about building cars is rare for a company of BMW's size, but the effect it could have on the automotive industry at large is enormous. The real test will be if BMW can implement these changes at similar costs to more traditional methods and if the vehicles' materials pass customer scrutiny.

The company described the deal as an important milestone on its path to slash carbon emissions from its supply network. It comes as the firm moves to ramp up its electric vehicle offering, and strategically so.

The German carmaker acknowledged that electric vehicles have an advantage over gas or diesel in tailpipe emissions. Still, there are significant challenges related to their manufacture – notably, the aluminum and battery cells. Aluminum will be one of the essential materials for electric models because its lightweight properties help offset the batteries’ heavyweight.

BMW said:

The trend towards e-mobility means that a much larger percentage of a vehicle’s lifecycle CO2 emissions now comes from the upstream added value in the supplier network. In an electrified vehicle, CO2 emissions from the use phase are much lower, but producing battery cells or aluminum is very energy-intensive.

BMW made the deal with the United Arab Emirates-based industrial firm Emirates Global Aluminium (EGA). BMW chose EGA because it was the first business globally to utilize solar electricity for commercial aluminum production.

EGA will provide the carmaker with 43,000 metric tons of aluminum this year, produced at Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park – a massive development in the desert south of Dubai.

The “solar aluminum” will be shipped to the light metal foundry of BMW’s plant in Landshut, Germany, where it will be processed and turned into car parts. Half of Landshut foundry’s yearly aluminum requirement will come from EGA.

This deal is part of a broader “long-term” strategy to source aluminum produced from renewable. According to BMW, the transaction could save approximately 2.5 million metric tons of CO2 from entering the atmosphere by 2030.",BMW To Source Aluminum Using Solar Power Starting This Year

The cases would be modelled on one brought against Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L)in the Netherlands last year arguing the company's lack of climate action constituted a failure in its duty of care to citizens, which led to a court ruling in May mandating the company to reduce its CO2 output by 45% from 2019 levels by 2030. read more

These deadlines are necessary to meet the goals of the Paris climate accords and German climate law, the NGOs argue.

They set a deadline of a few weeks for the companies to respond to their demands. Should they fail to do so, the NGOs will file lawsuits in German courts, they said.

These are the highlights:

Diesel, petrol, PHEV & BEV

Deliveries in October 2022

Both front-wheel-drive and all-wheel-drive

Stronger accent on roominess and comfort

For BMW, the energy transition isn’t about betting on one horse, and the launch of the all-new X1 is a striking example of that strategy. When coming to market in autumn, the compact SUV will demonstrate its flexibility by offering two diesel versions and a pair of petrol engines, with the all-new electric iX1 following almost immediately in their slipstream. The more powerful ICEs rely on mild-hybrid technology.

In a second phase, two upgraded plug-in hybrids (xDrive20e and xDrive30e) enrich the line-up with improved charging (up to 7.4kW) and a longer pure-electric range of up to 89 kilometres compared to the outgoing model.

Range of 438 kilometres

The zero-emission iX1 xDrive30 EV draws on a battery with a net capacity of 64.7kWh, predicted to provide a range of between 413 to 438 kilometres (257-272 miles), and a dual motor for four-wheel drive. BMW hasn’t released details on charging times but confirms that the car comes equipped with the latest charging software introduced in the i7. Indeed, the Volvo XC40 Recharge and Mercedes Mercedes-EQ GLB face stiff competition.

As the new entry-level electric BMW, the iX1 replaces the pioneering i3, which goes out of production by June 2022. The model helped shape the EV market for a decade in Europe whilst carving out a sustainability profile for the Bavarian brand and was still going strong, with sales rising at a staggering 38% in Q1 2022.

Emphasis on comfort

On the inside, the X1 takes most of its inspiration from the 2 Series Active Tourer, with a curved display combining a digital gauge cluster and infotainment with this latter touch screen replacing the former iDrive rotary controller. Thanks to new seats and better insulation, BMW claims that during development, it put a strong emphasis on enhanced comfort.

With a length of 4500mm, the new X1 is slightly longer than its predecessor, also bringing a 22mm-longer wheelbase for a roomier interior and more cargo space (+35 litres). However, the iX1 loses 50 litres because of the installed battery in the floor compartment.

BMW hasn’t yet released prices for the iX1, but opened reservations. In Germany, the front-wheel-drive ICE X1 sDrive18i starts at 43,900 euro. With features like automated parking, an on-board dash cam, and 3D Remote View (real-time camera check of the vehicle on a smartphone app), more varied services are available than on the previous model. Depending on markets, specific options can be retrofitted by over-the-air updates.

German multinational giant and manufacturer of luxury vehicles and motorcycles BMW invested in Natural Fiber Welding through its venture capital firm, BMW i Ventures. The capital raised will help the sustainable material company scale its plastic-free leathers and textiles for commercial roll-to-roll production.

Plastic-free materials

Natural Fiber Welding(NFW) founder Luke Haverhals, has worked as a chemist with the United States Naval Academy. After being funded by the U.S. Department of Defense, Haverhals learned how to mold natural fiber structures at near-atomic precision.

The company created novel technologies designed to replace petrochemical-based materials such as synthetic leathers, and instead produces durable, 100% recyclable, and cruelty-free products. They are made of plant-based substances like hemp, waste cork, coconut, and vegetable oil.

NFW aims to commercialize these sustainable alternatives leathers, foams, and textiles. It’s building a new facility spanning more than 10,000-square-feet to do this. It will begin with manufacturing Mirum, its plant-based leather.

In the fashion industry, brands can send patterned textiles to NFW. These can be transformed into animal-free leather products and can be colored with non-toxic mineral pigments and plant dyes.

In a press release, Haverhals said: “BMW i Ventures’ commitment to high-performance companies across the manufacturing and transportation sector makes them an excellent investor and partner for NFW. We are honored to have their support as we continue to expand into new markets, like automotive, where all-natural, performance materials can have a huge impact in decarbonizing and creating a truly sustainable future.”

Global investor support

The investment made through BMW i Ventures will help the company to scale its production from batch processing of its materials to full-scale commercial capacity.

Managing partner at BMW i Ventures, Kasper Sage said: “Natural Fiber Welding has developed an innovative process of converting plants into all-natural, 100% recyclable material that mimic all the properties of traditional leather, yarns, and foams. Having a scalable, cost-competitive alternative to leather with premium qualities is key to further advance the decarbonization of the automotive industry.”

The BMW i Ventures invests in startups innovating in fields like transportation, supply chain, and sustainability. It invests in all stages with a special focus on Series A/B and in the past, has supported robotics firm Bright Machines, health supplements co Blackmore, electric company Proterra, and recycling service PureCycle.

Apart from investing in NFW, the BMW Group announced its plan to collaborate with the company to achieve its own sustainability goals. For instance, the Group wants to slash its CO2 emissions throughout its supply chain and that’s why it is on the hunt for recyclable and lower carbon footprint materials.

Last year, U.S. luxury fashion giant Ralph Lauren also invested in NFW, with plans to use the company’s technology to develop sustainable clothing.

According to the Circular Fashion Summit, the circular fashion industry is predicted to soar from US$3 trillion to US$5 trillion. Especially in the U.S., there is a growing preference for cruelty-free leather, with 55% of Americans opting for animal-free leather, given that animal welfare is a top priority for these consumers.

In a few years, many EVs will reach the end of their useful life

BMW reuses some batteries and recycles the rest

Since electric vehicles have entered the mainstream market, around ten years ago, the question as to what can be done with the batteries at the end of their life has remained.

Producing batteries generates a high quantity of polluting emissions and once their useful life is over, they can’t be disposed of easily due to the hazardous materials they contain.

However, even when they are at the end of their life, batteries are still full of minerals that can be recycled and reused in new batteries, such as cobalt and nickel.

Because there isn’t an official guideline on EV battery recycling, many automakers create their own programs to take care of the batteries installed in their older EVs.

BMW is the latest manufacturer to create a plan to recycle and reuse its EV’s batteries. The German automaker starts by reusing some batteries as a whole to power equipment in its factories, such as forklifts.

For the remaining batteries, the automaker harvests the raw materials that can be recycled and put back into a new battery.

Doing so reportedly lowers the C02 emissions associated with battery production by about 70% and allows for a circular economy which is less dependent on mining companies and the current market.

According to the automaker, the majority of its recycled batteries, at the moment, come from discarded test vehicles and prototypes, since most EVs are not yet old enough to be sold for scrap.

This could change fairly soon however, since BMW’s own i3 was introduced back in 2014, meaning that the oldest units are now 8 years old, which is not far off from the average age of the vehicles on American roads, which is now at just over 12 years.

This reuse and recycle program will help BMW achieve its goal to become carbon neutral by 2050 by limiting the quantity of newly mined minerals that are needed to build new cars.",BMW Developed a new Program to Reuse or Recycle old EV Batteries

The new fund will invest in early to mid-stage start-ups operating in the sustainability, transportation, manufacturing, and supply chain industries. This marks BMW i Ventures’ second dedicated investment fund, which is fully backed by BMW Group.

The new fund will operate in parallel to Fund I, furthering BMW i Ventures’ mission, and increasing the firm’s ability to make new investments.

With Fund II we will refocus our investment thesis to even better serve the needs of the ecosystem and the BMW Group as a whole. Even more than before, circularity and sustainability will play a key role in our investment activities. —Marcus Behrendt, managing partner, BMW i Ventures

BMW i Ventures was established as an independent venture capital firm in 2016. The company has since invested in approximately 50 early to mid-stage startups, many of which are sustainability-focused companies including Boston Metal, ChargePoint, Prometheus, Proterra, PureCycle, Solid Power, and Turntide.

Of the investments made in Fund I, BMW i Ventures has enabled seven companies to go public so far.

Alongside the creation of this new fund, BMW i Ventures also announced that Marcus Behrendt and Kasper Sage were named the two new managing partners of BMW i Ventures as Dr. Ulrich Quay will move into a new role at BMW Group in Munich, Germany. With the inception of Fund II, Baris Guzel was also promoted to partner.

Marcus Behrendt brings over 25 years of expertise in the automotive industry to this leadership position. Before joining BMW i Ventures in 2018, he worked in different management functions in research and development of the BMW Group, as a managing director for a market research company, and in various roles for another automotive OEM.

Kasper Sage has spent most of his career in Silicon Valley as a venture capital investor with previous roles in management consulting, corporate development & partnerships, as well as in working in startup operating roles.

Now the brand has rolled out further measures.

The new strategy focuses largely on the use of new, more environmentally friendly materials, some of which will be recycled as the brand aims to employ ‘circular economy’ practices in its production. But, it’s not just about recycling.

“The BMW Group believes only a holistic approach to the use of proven and new materials can permanently reduce CO2 emissions,” said the marque in a press statement issued overnight.

“For this reason, the BMW Group is focusing its research and development efforts on environmentally-compatible raw materials. At the same time, it is accelerating targeted the creation of a secondary-materials market and working with select startups and experienced material suppliers to develop pioneering materials.”

“We are setting new standards for sustainable premium quality – by rethinking materials and focusing more than ever on resource-efficient alternatives and renewable materials with strong dismantling capability,” said Dr Stefan Floeck, BMW’s newly appointed head of development for Mini and BMW’s compact line.

“We are following a consistent path towards holistically sustainable product development, responsible use of resources and transformation into a circular economy.”

To cut through some of the marketing fluff in the German firm’s words, it’s also revealed details about some of the materials it’s working on. It’s confirmed that hemp, flax, and kenaf fibres are all set to be used in the production of components like door trim panels as a natural fibre reinforcement.

Hemp and kenaf have connections to marijuana, with the former being part of the cannabis family and the latter also known as ‘Hibiscus cannabinus’. Both are already used in the production of all sorts of products, from rope and twine, to cosmetics, printer ink, and soaps.

BMW is also working on pioneering what it calls ‘wood foams’. These are “an open-pored structure made up of finely ground wood particles” according to BMW, perhaps similar in ethos to an MDF-style construction. Although in this case BMW says it will be produced from 100 per cent renewable materials. Wood foams are hoped to replace acoustic foams in future cars.

Seat cover materials are also in the pipeline for an environmental overhaul, with BMW in the process of researching synthetic textiles made solely from recycled materials. BMW says these materials could be recycled numerous times over.",BMW to tackle climate change by using hemp in its interiors

This marks the eighth generation since iDrive launched in 2001 on the BMW 7-Series. The iDrive 8 system launches in the BMW iX electric crossover later this year, followed by the BMW i4 electric sedan.

In the iX, iDrive will feature a massive curved display spanning most of the dashboard It will consist of a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster and 14.9-inch touchscreen mounted side by side. Both screens have a graphical resolution of 200 ppi, BMW said in a press release.

BMW retains the rotary knob that's been a part iDrive since the system's 2001 launch, but adds two-axis steering wheel controls that allow the driver to sift through menus by toggling horizontally or vertically. The controller is also now a clear puck instead of a black plastic dial. The displays also get three modes—Drive, Focus, and Gallery—that rearrange information. Drive is the default, Focus is meant for more intense driving situations, and Gallery minimizes driving information to create more space for other graphics.

The next-generation iDrive system also gets the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant voice-control feature available in current BMW models. Updates include a virtual ""face"" on the dashboard display, which was chosen from over 100 possible designs, according to the automaker. That may sound creepy, but BMW believes it will create more of a connection between the voice assistant and vehicle occupants. An expanded data pool will also improve functionality, the automaker said.

BMW iDrive 8

A similar data pool will also inform the climate control system, which can only be operated using the touchscreen or voice recognition, according to BMW. The default setting will be based on data from more than 440 million customer trips, while air conditioning settings will also consider the number of vehicle occupants, where they are sitting, and the intensity and direction of sunlight. The system can also learn drivers' personal preferences.

A digital key feature allows drivers to use their smartphones in place of a key fob, while BMW ID lets drivers transfer personalized setting between vehicles. The My Modes feature allows further personalization, encompassing everything from powertrain and chassis settings to display configurations and vehicle sounds—all selectable by voice command or via a button on the center console. The feature will launch with Efficient, Sport, and Personal modes, but others will be added later, BMW said.

BMW launched over-the-air (OTA) software updates with iDrive 7 in 2018, but iDrive 8 will be able to perform more complex updates, such as adding driver-assist features, BMW said. Data is routed through a 5G connection, and cars will have more than 30 antennae to transmit data, according to the automaker. This will allow the iX to transmit a DVD's worth of data in a little over a second, BMW said.

Previously known as the iNext, the BMW iX will be the first model to get iDrive 8 when it launches in the U.S. in 2022. Positioned as the technological flagship of the BMW brand, it will be available with up to 500 hp and a 300-mile range, plus next-generation driver-assist technology.","BMW iDrive 8 adds big screens, digital key, data-based climate control"

The solution comprises eight solar panels on the roof of the charging station. They feed a tower with six battery modules from the i3 which are no longer good enough for automotive use but are perfectly fine for storing the energy generated by these solar panels. An inverter manages these modules. It controls both the energy stored and charging electric vehicles that connect to the charging tower thanks to a BMW Wallbox charger.The charging station does not rely on the public grid, which would allow it to be placed in remote areas where there’s no access to power lines. Another possibility is to use them just to avoid spending money in sunny places. BMW also highlights that this charging station can be helpful if power shortages strike.The bad news about the off-grid solar charging station is how long it takes to charge any car. BMW said an i3 would recover only 100 km of range after being plugged in for two hours. For people in need of fast charging , this is definitely not the way to go.On the other hand, such stations could be established in parking lots in companies, for example. When people start going back to offices, their cars will be sitting for at least six hours in the same spot anyway. If yourhas time to spare, the off-grid solar charging station may fit like a glove if the cost for establishing it is economically feasible.

The Solarwatt Battery Flex is a modular storage device, with the system able to expanded from 4.8KWh to 240kWh through the stacking of up to eight battery packs and creation of up to 10 clusters.

It differs from previous Solarwatt storage offerings in that it is much smaller and easier to install, with CEO Detlef Neuhaus claiming in a press conference announcing the product that “no mistake can be made in installing this storage unit” because the device indicates if it’s correctly installed and there is therefore no chance to incorrectly install it.

Additionally, the individual components of the Solarwatt Battery Flex weigh no more than 25 kilograms, meaning the storage system can be installed by a single person.

Solarwatt is make the AC-1 system available in the autumn, which will be followed by the AC-3 and DC-hybrid systems in 2022, allowing the portfolio to be rolled out fully.

Describing the company as a well-stablished system provider, Neuhaus said the next logical step for it was “of course sector coupling”. He cited the carbon reductions that can be achieved when e-mobility, heat pumps and solar PV are combined, but added that “we are convinced this is only possible with strong partners”.

The company has therefore created the Solarwatt Battery Flex with car manufacturer BMW, with the system using components that are also used in BMW’s electric vehicles (EVs).

When the Solarwatt Battery Flex system is paired with solar PV and used in conjunction with the Solarwatt Manager Flex intelligent energy management system, it is particularly efficient, with the latter controling and optimising the energy flows in the household and ensuring that as much solar power as possible is consumed in the household itself.

Speaking today, Neuhaus also explained that while a stationary house application requires higher cycle stability, e-mobility applications can work with lower cycle stability but need high power density. With it ""being clear"" there is a move towards bidirectional charging, which will mean EVs will be charged more frequently than just for mobility, “we need a cell and cell system that can do both things and this cell can do that”.

Solarwatt’s partnership with BMW has already been in place since 2013, with this initially involving arranging complete PV solutions for roof systems and carports for BMW i customers.

In 2019, the company announced it would be stepping up its presence in the UK solar and storage markets with a raft of new initiatives designed at leveraging how “receptive” the UK is to energy storage. Since then, it has also launched a smart solar-powered EV charging offering in the UK in partnership with Austrian e-mobility solutions manufacturer Keba, while also teaming up with Centregreat Group to develop solar-powered EV carports with built-in battery packs.",Solarwatt teams up with BMW to launch modular battery product

Called the Rival Rig gaming chair, it is the perfect bridge between the physical world and the virtual world – giving the users a functional sensory input while being utterly comfortable. An ideal proposition for streamers and Esports professionals indeed. The idea is to analyze the player’s movements and adapt to their sitting position for a weightless feeling sans any physical stress during long hours of casual or professional gaming. This adaptive stance leads to sustained performance of the player not limited by physical or mental stress.

Rival Rig is embedded with sensors that detect the rise in body temperature and then beam cool air to the particular area. They call it the Microclimate Control System. Likewise, if there is too much pressure on the arms, the armrests lower automatically to eliminate any pressure points – a feature dubbed as the Adaptive Seating made possible with the embedded pneumatic air pads and electro-mechanical actuators. Designworks worked with gamers and athletes to understand body posture and the different actions and moods they are going through during gaming. The result is different modes like ease mode for relaxed posture or the boost mode, which brings the chair forward, and the table lowered and angled for immersive gameplay. The chair also has the massage function to release any stress build-up in the muscles with extended gaming stints. In conjunction with the AI-enabled algorithm, all this brings automated control to the chair, allowing players to concentrate on their gameplay.

According to Holger Hampf, President of Designworks, the team’s goal was to “create the most comfortable seating, hand posture, and head movement situation, that allow the gamer to immerse fully.” Inspiration for the project came from fields where split-second decisions have to be made – like in spacecraft and Formula 1. Holger Hampf added that they adapted learning from these fields to the microscopic level, and it was all about millimeters rather than centimeters,” in design perfection. The led lighting of the chair adapts to the environment of the in-game action for the perfect immersive environment. How the Rig is articulating also allows the audience (online and live) to be part of the action – for good bonding between the gaming athletes and spectators.

The gaming chair will be open source for adding new features and allowing game studios to tailor the in-game experience. It will also aid in collaboration with the right partners to access the health and sports data to design ergonomic chairs of the future. Rival Rig is truly the onset of immersion via the power of design!

BMW, as part of a larger line-up update exercise for the summer, has announced some enhancements for for the G30 5 Series, G31 5 Series Touring and G32 6 Series Gran Turismo models.

New to all three models is the four-zone automatic climate control system (previously an optional upgrade). This also includes a nanoparticle filter with nano-fleece and active carbon layers. The climate control system is already standard on the G07 BMW X7, but remains an option for 7 Series, 8 Series, X5, X6.

Meanwhile, the 6 Series GT can be had with M multifunctional seats, which is a new upgrade option. Available for the driver and front passenger, the new seats with integrated head restraints are said to provide optimised side and shoulder support, and they are power adjustable (including thigh support, backrest angle and width, and headrest height).

Like the updated 4 Series, the trio here also gets the enhanced Lane Departure Warning System as standard. At speeds above 70 km/h, the camera-based system will more precisely align the car to road markings. When driving on narrow country roads where the lanes have no centre marking and are less than 2.6-metres wide, the steering correction system will be overridden. For oncoming traffic detection, the system will use the outer edge of the lane as guides.","four-zone climate control with nano filter, M multifunction seats"

In the short term, the German carmaker forecast on Wednesday a big rise in pretax profit for this year, with a strong performance in all areas – from MINIS through its upmarket BMW brand to top-of-the-range Rolls-Royces.

Its shares rose as much as 4.9% to a 2½-year high of €84.42, buoyed by its forecast for a strong recovery from a pandemic-hit 2020.

Bernstein analyst Arndt Ellinghorst said BMW had entered 2021 “very confidently.”

“In terms of electromobility, BMW is making good progress and is taking significantly fewer risks than VW,“ he said.

Volkswagen has said it expects 70% of European sales at its core VW brand to be electric by 2030 and this week unveiled ambitious plans to expand in electric driving – including building half a dozen battery cell plants in Europe - sending its shares sharply higher.

BMW said around 90% of its market categories would have fully-electric models available by 2023 and the electric BMW i4 would be launched three months ahead of schedule this year.

The carmaker said its MINI brand would be fully electric “by the early 2030s” and electric models would account for at least 50% of group deliveries by 2030.

When asked if BMW could set a date for ending sales of internal combustion engines, as some rivals have, chief technology officer Frank Weber said: “it’s not us who decides on the end of the internal combustion engine, but it’s the markets.”

In an industry chasing electric carmaker Tesla and facing tightening CO2 emissions standards in Europe and China, some automakers have promised a faster shift in technology, despite the huge costs and manufacturing changes involved.

Sweden's Volvo said this month its lineup would be fully electric by 2030, and Ford said in February its lineup in Europe would be too.

Sales of electric and plug-in hybrid cars in the European Union almost trebled to over 1 million vehicles in 2020 and accounted for more than 10% of overall sales, taking zero-emission models from niche products into the mainstream.

Chief executive Oliver Zipse told a news conference that BMW could accelerate its plans if consumers embraced electric models more quickly than expected. “Should demand in certain markets shift completely to fully electric vehicles in the coming years – we can deliver,“ he said.

Last week, BMW said 2021 had started well after its profit recovered in the second half of 2020 from pandemic shutdowns, thanks largely to strong sales in China.

For this year, it expects an operating profit margin of 6%-8% after 2.7% in 2020.

Volkswagen said this week its 2021 operating margin should be at the upper end of its 5%-6.5% target range, with a goal of 7%-8% by 2025. – Reuters",BMW says half of sales to be zero-emission vehicles by 2030

CarBuzz discovered a BMW patent at the German Patent and Trade Mark Office (DPMA) detailing a radical new method of placing solar panels on a car's outer glass panels, which promises improved generating efficiency and vastly reduced light intrusion into the vehicle.

The first application of this technology will likely be on one of the German company's high-end EVs, such as future BMW XM or BMW iX SUVs because their large interior volumes could use every bit of shade they could get.

Solar panels on cars aren't new, though. Beginning in the 1990s, many premium manufacturers experimented with using solar panels, usually mounted in the sunroof panel, to power their cars' ventilation systems, which is still available today. However, BMW's new patent is somewhat different because these new solar panels will cover the sunroof, the front and rear windscreens, and the side glass to generate much more electricity than the older systems could manage.","BMW's New Solar Panels Can Charge A Car Via The Sunroof, Windscreens, And Windows"

These are conducted at its battery swap stations of which it plans to launch 4,000 global branches by 2025.

Aviation accounts for about 2.5% of the world’s carbon emissions.

More fuel-efficient planes have halved commercial flights’ emissions over the past 30 years–and we are partnering with NASA to develop and test a full-scale demonstrator airplane that could inform the designs of future airplanes to be as much as 30% more fuel-efficient.

However, achieving net zero in the next 28 years will also require rethinking which non-fossil energy sources should power the aircraft itself.

The problem

When it comes to changing airplanes’ energy carriers, safety and the laws of physics rule. Finding renewable energy alternatives with the same energy density and volumetric efficiency as fossil fuels is difficult.

Today, flights over 1,000 miles account for 80% of the industry’s emissions. New batteries will enable electric aircraft to be developed for short-haul travel–but batteries weigh too much for longer flights.

Many challenges must be overcome before hydrogen-powered long-haul planes can safely complete flights, refuel, and leave for their next destinations within an hour as most do today.

Loading the smallest molecule in the universe into aircraft is tricky. Due to their small size and required cryogenic conditions, hydrogen molecules can leak through minute pores of welded seams and be absorbed into metal, since hydrogen and cooler temperatures can make metal brittle. Airports will need new infrastructure and training to safely load and handle the frigid fuel that must be chilled at -423 degrees Fahrenheit.

Storing hydrogen poses equally complicated challenges. Planes will have to be redesigned since hydrogen requires more space, as well as cryogenic conditions. Hydrogen takes up to four times the volume as jet fuel.

Hydrogen must be proven every bit as safe and practical as traditional jet fuel to be viable. That means governments will need to establish an alternative set of airworthiness requirements.

What the numbers say about reaching net zero by 2050

NASA’s inspiring Artemis 1 mission reminds us of valuable lessons for hydrogen aircraft and what it means to achieve net zero emissions by 2050.

The Space Launch System rocket we developed with NASA used supercooled hydrogen to launch the uncrewed Orion spacecraft. It is the latest in a long line of spacecraft and test aircraft to prove hydrogen-powered flight possible over the past half century. With NASA, we flew on hydrogen when Apollo 11 took humanity to the moon in 1969.

Using hydrogen directly in commercial aircraft requires substantial changes to both the aircraft and the infrastructure around it. Learning how to safely and efficiently load, store, fly and scale hydrogen-powered aircraft will be the challenge of a generation of engineers.

By contrast, short and long-range aircraft can fly on sustainable aviation fuels, or SAF, which are non-fossil certified variants of traditional petroleum jet fuel. The primary materials can be sustainable bio-based waste sources like plant oils and cooking oil, industrial capture, or even the electric grid itself. SAF can be dropped into today’s aircraft and infrastructure to mitigate emissions immediately by up to 80% over their life cycle.

While flying on hydrogen does not emit carbon, its production often does. Since most hydrogen today is produced from fossil fuels, truly reducing emissions by flying on hydrogen will also require a wholesale transformation of the energy industry to ensure sufficient so-called green hydrogen produced from renewable electricity exists for aviation. Aviation has to compete with other sectors for green hydrogen as it becomes available.

Even then, it is arithmetically impossible to replace the world’s fleets with hydrogen-powered airplanes in time to meet the industry’s 2050 target.

By the late 2030s, we estimate more than 40,000 non-hydrogen commercial jets will be in service. Each will last decades. Given that the most airplanes ever produced around the world in a year so far have been about 1,800, we can’t just switch overnight to hydrogen. Emissions from those aircraft will need to be mitigated with SAF.

Hydrogen-powered aircraft may make a small contribution to moderating emissions in 2050. And while research today may develop solutions for the latter half of the century, it must also consider the 2050 challenge at hand.

To ensure future generations can continue to fly and enjoy the other global benefits the aerospace industry contributes to a strong economy, aviation must focus on developing and scaling SAF. Advances in the science and engineering of complex hydrogen propulsion technologies should be pursued, but likely apply to the longer term.

Our founder Bill Boeing once said, “Let no new improvement in flying and flying equipment pass us by.” As the Artemis 1 mission shows, our industry achieves the seemingly unattainable. The world must scale sustainable aviation fuels that can be dropped into existing aircraft today, while exploring decarbonized propulsion technologies like hydrogen and electricity that can make an impact in the second half of the century.

Government and independent testing found contamination from Santa Susana at a neighboring children’s camp, nearby parks and residential neighborhoods. Stormwater carries chemicals off the site, exceeding government limits.

Boeing Co, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the U.S. Department of Energy share responsibility for the site – and they are on the hook to clean it up. Boeing assumed liability for a large portion of the property in 1996, when it acquired the previous co-owner, Rocketdyne. In 2007, Boeing signed an agreement with California to make 1,900 acres clean enough that people could live on the land and eat vegetables from their gardens.

But most of that cleanup never happened. Now, Boeing is pursuing an unorthodox strategy that could enable it to bypass cleaning up much of the land . The company is using a legal agreement meant to preserve nature to argue that it should be allowed to leave much of the pollution untouched.

The aerospace giant donated the property’s development rights to a land trust under an arrangement known as a “conservation easement.” Such easements, which restrict building, are intended to preserve open space, protecting scenic vistas, wildlife habitat and cultural heritage.

Boeing has held up the donation as an example of its commitment to environmental stewardship. In its 2018 annual environmental report, it quoted Stephen Thor Johnson, then president of its partner in the easement deal, the North American Land Trust (NALT). “The value of this open space,” Johnson said, “will be magnified over the coming decades and be remembered as a truly visionary act like the creation of Central Park or the conservation of the Presidio.”

Left unsaid was how Boeing stands to benefit. Within a month of donating the easement to NALT, Boeing told the state of California it no longer intended to make the property clean enough to live on. Because the easement prohibits building on the land, the company said, Boeing instead intended to make the property safe for light recreation, such as hiking. That lesser standard would leave the vast majority of chemical pollution in the ground and shave at least tens of millions and perhaps hundreds of millions of dollars off the company’s cleanup costs, according to a Reuters analysis of the proposed cleanup standards and soil sampling data. Four independent cleanup specialists vetted the analysis.

California rejected Boeing’s argument that the conservation easement warranted a lesser cleanup, but to avoid a lawsuit and further delays, the state reopened negotiations with the company anyway. Boeing has won a preliminary victory in getting the state to consider new cleanup scenarios, including some that take the easement into account. All of the new options would leave more pollution behind than the cleanup the state approved years ago, according to a Reuters review of the company’s latest agreement with the California Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC).

Boeing’s strategy angers Jen Connell, who lost her husband, Mike, in April to glioblastoma, an aggressive brain cancer. He lived most of his 50 years within five miles of Santa Susana’s rocket-testing platforms and blamed radioactive ash from there for his disease. Radiation is known to increase the risk of glioblastoma.

“What about preserving human life?” said the mother of two. “They got a smoke screen going on to make them look like they have a halo.”

Boeing, in a statement to Reuters, said it is “misleading” to say that it is using the conservation easement to limit cleanup at Santa Susana. Boeing noted it has agreed to clean up one type of contaminant – radioactive material – to levels present before the field lab existed. Though its agreement with California expresses Boeing’s preference to clean up other contaminants to the safe-for-recreation standard, the company also noted it has agreed to accept whatever cleanup the state chooses, including a stricter option that would make the site safe for homes and gardening. State officials told Reuters they intend to require this.

Still, state officials acknowledged that all the options outlined in the new Boeing agreement would clean up less soil than called for in the old one. In a written response to Reuters, they said the changes reflected the state’s use of “best available science.” Regulators will hold Boeing to the same health protections required previously, they wrote, and the easement will not influence their choice of a cleanup option.

‘Foolish’

The idea of using a conservation easement to lobby for a lesser cleanup of polluted land rankles James Florio, the former U.S. representative who authored the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980. Congress passed the act, commonly known as the Superfund law, to require companies to clean up their toxic messes. Easements shouldn’t be used as an excuse to leave pollution behind, Florio said.

“Saying you’re not going to clean it up because it’s not going to do any harm, because it’s not going to be used, is foolish,” he said.

Yet dozens of companies across the United States have benefited from the strategy. And the country’s top environmental watchdog, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, is encouraging conservation easements on polluted land as a way to make contaminated sites useful again.

Conservation easements on contaminated sites Because of decentralized record-keeping systems, no one knows how many conservation easements are on contaminated land. Reuters identified 40 mostly by scouring county land records and regulatory documents.

Reuters found conservation easements on at least 40 contaminated sites, including former landfills, mines, waste ponds and burn pits. Twenty-four of the locations are or have been in the federal Superfund program, which targets the nation’s most toxic waste sites.

In each case Reuters uncovered, the easement contract notes the land’s history of contamination. For at least 25 sites, Reuters found documents that acknowledge the safety of the cleanup relies in part on the conservation easement’s promise to prevent development or other activities on the land. In at least six cases, state or federal regulators cited the easement’s land restrictions as a reason to let polluters conduct lesser cleanups that left some contamination behind.

Meant to protect people from dangerous exposure to toxic substances, the easement arrangements rely on landowners, land trusts and developers to honor prohibitions on unsafe activity for as long as the danger remains. But Reuters found that these agreements and others like them are inconsistently enforced, lapses that can result in dire health consequences, legal and environmental scholars said.

Environmental monitoring reports show pollution is migrating from some of these contaminated sites and threatening neighboring communities. At others, contaminants endanger plants and animals. People have built homes, unwittingly or not, on or near properties that had restrictions similar to conservation easements, exposing them to contaminated water, toxic fumes and cancer causing chemicals.

The matchmaker

Some environmental regulators and cleanup consultants argue that easements can play an important role on polluted properties. Along with deed restrictions, zoning controls and other notices attached to land records, easements aim to ensure that people don’t build on contaminated land.

Nor is it always possible to fully decontaminate polluted land. The cost can be out of reach. It also can be technically impossible or impractical.

“I wish there were endless resources to clean everything up,” said Jim Kuipers, a consulting engineer who has worked on mine cleanups for decades. “The EPA’s charge is to protect human health and the environment. It’s not to restore to background or entirely pure conditions.”

Regulators have long supported easements as a warning flag for future generations. Reuters found some dating back as far as 1991.

But that was never their intended purpose, scholars say. “Plunking a conservation easement on a property in lieu of cleaning it up is a perversion of the use of a conservation easement,” said Nancy McLaughlin, a law professor at the University of Utah whose work focuses on the legal agreements.

Yet in recent years, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the regulatory body responsible for monitoring and approving cleanups of Superfund sites, has been encouraging companies to use easements to save time and reduce costs. The agency notes additional benefits: Preserving land can boost a company’s image as a friend of the environment, and some can claim tax deductions for donating their polluted land.

Easements can “provide win-win-win opportunities for everyone and in many cases, also vulnerable species,” the EPA told Reuters in a statement. The deals also can help companies “repair their relationship with the community.”

The agency held a webinar in January 2020 called “The Brilliant and Profitable Role of Conservation Easements in Superfund Site Redevelopment.”

“Never underestimate the value of a great story,” Bill Denman, then EPA acting national program manager for Superfund redevelopment, told participants. “The environment wins, the community wins, the developer wins.”

Denman has played matchmaker, looking to connect companies with land trusts willing to take easements on contaminated land. One ally is Kat West, a former EPA lawyer turned consultant who has called herself the “EPA whisperer.”

West was a featured speaker at the January 2020 webinar. She contacted EPA regulators that month via email, saying she had spoken with NALT – the land trust that holds the easement on Boeing’s Santa Susana property – about doing more work on contaminated sites. NALT was looking for new partners, she said.

“Steve Carter is the President and said we can send people directly to him,” West wrote.

West arranged a call with Carter and the EPA’s Denman. Soon, Denman provided Carter a new opportunity. In a February 2020 email, Denman introduced the NALT leader to a cleanup specialist from the multinational chemical company BASF to discuss a conservation easement on contaminated BASF land. The EPA told Reuters the conversation was meant to explore placing a conservation easement on the land to protect a bird habitat that had been created during a cleanup nine years earlier.

The EPA said the conservation idea never came to fruition. A BASF spokesperson said he was unaware of any ongoing discussions with NALT. West declined to comment.

Asked about the agency’s promotion of conservation easements, the EPA described the deals as tools to ensure the future safety of a site, not influencers of its cleanup decisions. The EPA said it encourages adding easements after a cleanup method is chosen, not before.

An opaque system

Conservation easements gained prominence after the U.S. Congress in 1980 created permanent tax breaks for them, to preserve “natural resources and cultural heritage.”

It is impossible to know how many companies have placed conservation easements on contaminated land. Also unknowable is whether companies have sought tax breaks for such easements in the name of land conservation. That’s because neither corporations nor nonprofits are required to disclose detailed information about the easements. The EPA and other regulators say they don’t keep count or any central record of them. Tax deductions and land appraisals are private, and the United States keeps no comprehensive records of property conservation.

Reuters identified most of the 40 easements on contaminated land by searching for mentions in environmental regulatory documents and by reviewing land records in hundreds of U.S. counties, where the easements are recorded along with property deeds. Beyond Boeing, major multinationals that have granted easements on polluted land directly or via subsidiaries include oil companies Chevron, BP, ExxonMobil and Citgo Petroleum, chemicals giant DuPont, aerospace contractor Lockheed Martin and drug maker AstraZeneca.

“Plunking a conservation easement on a property in lieu of cleaning it up is a perversion of the use of a conservation easement.”

Boeing and Chevron were among a handful of companies that said they did not seek tax deductions for their conservation easements. Citgo Petroleum confirmed it took a tax deduction but declined to disclose the amount. The others either declined to comment, didn’t respond to inquiries or said they didn’t know if they took a deduction. Reuters found 13 companies with easement contracts that refer to the section of the Internal Revenue Service code that allows for conservation-easement tax deductions, leaving the door open to claim them.

Even without claiming tax breaks, companies can realize significant financial savings by leveraging the easements in cleanup negotiations with regulators.

Companies save money because in choosing a cleanup plan, regulators consider how people might use the property in the future and what health risks the contaminants pose. The most expensive cleanups restore property to a pristine condition or make it safe enough for people to live there, drink the groundwater and eat food grown in home gardens. Less cleanup is required if the land is to be used for hiking or other recreation. Even less is necessary if a conservation easement allows little to no use of the property.

The savings can easily total tens of millions of dollars, said engineer Kuipers, who has consulted on dozens of cleanups and testified in court cases as an expert on cost estimates. For the largest and most contaminated sites, like Boeing’s, he said, companies could save hundreds of millions of dollars.

EPA records show Chevron saved an estimated $45 million when the EPA approved a less costly cleanup for a Questa, New Mexico, site where Chevron once mined molybdenum, a metal used mainly in the construction and energy sectors. The agency cited a 2009 conservation easement as a reason to allow the company to make part of the site clean enough for industrial use rather than requiring it to make the land safe for housing.

The choice left 25 times more cancer-causing polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in the ground than the most stringent cleanup would have allowed, EPA records show. The records also show that molybdenum, which had been found at levels 75 times higher than is safe for housing, was not required to be cleaned up at all in that section. Chevron provides bottled water to employees of a local fishery because the metal – harmful to people and wildlife in high doses – has been found in tap water there, according to a 2018 state and federal report about the site. A fishery employee confirmed that the company is still providing water today.

In an emailed response to questions, Chevron said the conservation easement supports the cleanup goals for the property. It said that the land is too steep for home construction and that the company is doing everything the EPA requires in its cleanup.

Boeing declined to answer questions about how much it stands to save if California allows it to scale back the cleanup at Santa Susana. State regulators said they have not yet estimated the costs of the various scenarios. “Based on similar cleanups, we expect the costs of cleaning up the Boeing areas of responsibility to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars,” the regulators said.

A Reuters analysis of the state’s various cleanup standards shows Boeing’s cleanup could allow some chemicals to remain at levels tens, hundreds, and even thousands of times higher than previously promised.

Officials from the DTSC objected to the news agency’s focus on the amount of pollution the cleanup would leave behind. What matters, they said, are the health standards driving the cleanup requirements. Those standards focus on minimizing the risk of cancer or other health issues.

State officials said they still intend to require Boeing to make the land safe enough to live on, even though the law requires them to consider other scenarios, some of which require less cleanup.

“DTSC has fought fervently for a clear path toward this high standard and will continue to do so until the cleanup is complete,” they said in an emailed response.

Yet at Boeing’s behest, the state has changed the way it calculates safety standards at Santa Susana.

A Boeing contractor urged DTSC officials to reexamine the formula that determines which parts of Santa Susana need to be cleaned up, state emails show. DTSC officials said they agreed because their previous calculations did not reflect the “best science.” Under the state’s revised formula, even the strictest cleanup DTSC is considering – one that allows homes on the property – would leave far more pollution behind.

Corporations and their partners who support the use of conservation easements say that even if some contaminants remain, the open land still provides viable wildlife habitat and green space for people to enjoy. If the land were fully cleaned up, some argue, those benefits would be lost because companies would sell the land to developers to recoup some of their cleanup costs.

If remaining contamination is properly managed, cleanup specialists said, sites can be used safely as parks, soccer fields, parking lots and more. Easements and other land-use restrictions can help conserve land worth preserving and protect people from the hazards that remain.

Some environmental scientists say the benefits to wildlife and the environment are often overstated.

Take Santa Susana. Boeing has said that the land preservation plan has “secured Santa Susana’s bright future as open space habitat.” The site is home to endangered plants and more than 150 types of animals.

Some of the cleanup options the state is considering would leave wildlife vulnerable to cancers and reproductive issues for decades, if not centuries, to come, said Frank von Hippel, a professor of environmental health sciences at the University of Arizona who reviewed the primary Santa Susana cleanup scenarios. Studies have linked many of the site’s contaminants to animal tumors, cancers, and reproductive and immune dysfunction.

“If the property is not safe for people, then it certainly is not safe for much of the wildlife,” von Hippel said.

State regulators said they would use Boeing’s ecological risk assessments in evaluating the impacts on wildlife.

“The assertion that the cleanup will ‘leave wildlife vulnerable’ is incorrect,” the regulators said in their response.

The use of conservation easements as protection for people isn’t foolproof, either. The limits recorded in conservation easements, deed restrictions and other controls linked to property records can get lost with the passage of time. And history shows that can have devastating health consequences.

It was this very kind of public health disaster that spurred Congress to create the Superfund program in 1980 to require cleanup of the nation’s most polluted lands. Congress was responding to a national outcry over children and adults sickened by pollution in the Love Canal neighborhood of Niagara Falls, New York.

The owner of a former chemical plant had sold to the Niagara Falls Board of Education – for a cost of $1 – land that the company had used as a dumping ground for more than 21,000 tons of toxic waste. Attached to the 1953 sale documents – and publicly filed at the Niagara County clerk’s office – was a warning that the land contained dangerous chemicals and that the buyers assumed all liability, including risk of death. Though different from a conservation easement, the notice had the same intent: to warn people about the property’s limitations.

Just a year later, the Board of Education, needing classrooms for a growing community, built an elementary school on the property. For more than 20 years, children splashed in contaminated puddles and played over leaking waste drums buried just beneath the surface. Several children required medical treatment for chemical burns on their faces.

After chemicals seeped into neighboring homes, the state declared a public health emergency in 1978. Pregnant women and children under age 2 were told to evacuate. The school was closed, at least 80 chemicals were identified at the site, and residents of the Love Canal neighborhood were instructed to stay out of their basements. More than 700 homes would eventually be razed.

Reuters found other examples of failed protections.

They included an abandoned battery recycling plant in Hamburg, Pennsylvania, where the EPA found chickens and cows grazing on contaminated land and drinking lead-contaminated water in 2012 in violation of a conservation easement. Lead contamination can transfer from cows and chickens to people who consume their dairy products. Reuters was unable to determine whether that occurred here.

In Newark, New Jersey, Ronson Metals Corp closed a decades-old factory that had made cigarette lighters. The company, with state permission, left hazardous chemicals – including trichloroethylene, which can cause neurological damage and has been linked to cancer – in the soil, covering the site with clay and crushed stone. It filed a deed restriction in 2002, limiting the land’s use to non-residential purposes such as parking. Despite this, developers built 19 homes and five businesses on the land in the 2000s. After the state learned of the situation in 2012, it installed pumps to vent toxic fumes from residents’ basements.

Conservation easements, in theory, carry more protection than the simple notice filed in the case of Love Canal. They require some entity – such as a government agency or a land trust – to accept responsibility for enforcement.

“Put quite simply, our goal is to leave places better than we found them.”

The Land Trust Alliance, the primary association of land trusts, publishes best practices for land trusts overseeing conservation easements. They call for visiting the land at least once every five years. In intervening years, annual checks can be done from the air. In the event a land trust disbands, it should take “reasonable steps” to transfer conservation easements to other stewards.

NALT, the land trust that accepted Boeing’s controversial easement, left the voluntary alliance because it disagreed with a 2019 policy change requiring member land trusts to review donors’ tax appraisals, said Carter, NALT’s president. NALT believed that policy conflicted with IRS guidance, he said.

NALT’s holdings of more than 500 easements include others that have stirred controversy, including one on property owned by former President Donald Trump. That property is the subject of a tax fraud investigation by the New York attorney general. Trump denies wrongdoing and calls the probe a politically motivated witch hunt.

Since 2006, at least nine IRS disputes over NALT easements have ended up in U.S. Tax Court. The cases include some on golf courses with conditions that the IRS says run counter to conservation, such as strong chemicals used to maintain the greens and a border collie trained to chase away wildlife. The IRS also opened an audit of an investment group’s 2018 tax return that included a $220 million deduction facilitated by NALT. The deduction relied on a practice lawmakers have labeled an “abusive tax shelter” that uses overinflated land valuations. Asked about the status of the case, the IRS said it could not comment on “pending litigation.” NALT declined to comment.

Carter said the trust does not shy away from “messy” projects that fit its conservation mission.

NALT and Boeing declined to disclose the full terms of their deal. Carter said Boeing paid NALT a “pretty hefty” sum to monitor the Santa Susana site in perpetuity. Neither he nor Boeing would reveal the amount.

Asked what the monitoring would entail, Carter said NALT intends to visit the property at least once a year and will use drones and satellite imagery to help enforce the easement. Carter emphasized that NALT is not responsible for monitoring any remaining pollution and assumed no liability for the contamination.

Since granting the easement to NALT, Boeing has been promoting the deal on its website and in company reports as an example of its commitment to environmental stewardship.

In 2021, at a ceremony sponsored by Boeing, the Wildlife Habitat Council gave the company an award for its efforts to preserve the Santa Susana site. The nonprofit council, created by industry to promote corporate conservation, also listed Boeing as the sponsor of a 2017 white paper on corporate conservation, in which the company’s director of environment, health and safety wrote: “In our pursuit of global environmental leadership, we champion the value of going above and beyond compliance. Our robust remediation and restoration program exemplifies this approach. Put quite simply, our goal is to leave places better than we found them.”

Margaret O'Gorman, president of the Wildlife Habitat Council, declined to comment on the dispute over the Santa Susana cleanup, but called the site “an incredible asset for nature as one of the last open spaces in the Simi Valley.” A spokesman for the council said its awards are based on scores determined by third-party reviewers.

Melissa Bumstead has been speaking out against such claims since learning about the Santa Susana pollution seven years ago.

The mother of two says she still regrets moving her family in 2012 to West Hills, less than five miles southeast of the Boeing site. Two years after they settled there, her daughter, Grace, was diagnosed with a rare form of leukemia at age 4.

Grace has spent much of her childhood in hospitals. With a weakened immune system, playgrounds, dance classes and even eating fresh strawberries proved too dangerous for her to enjoy. Two girls she befriended in treatment have since died.

After a relapse and bone marrow transplant in 2017, Grace, now 12, is in remission but must take growth hormone shots daily until she’s 16 to counter side effects of treatments she’s endured.

“I struggle with this now even though I know it’s not my fault,” Bumstead said. Grace’s cancer is considered “one in a million,” but there has been at least one other child diagnosed with the same rare cancer less than five miles from Santa Susana since Grace got sick, Bumstead said.

In 2005, Boeing paid $30 million to settle neighbors’ claims that contamination from Santa Susana caused cancers and other illnesses, according to a plaintiff in the case. Boeing declined to comment on the settlement.

The 1959 nuclear reactor accident at the site may have caused hundreds, if not thousands, of cancer cases in neighboring communities, an advisory panel of scientists and other stakeholders concluded in a 2006 government-commissioned report.

A separate 2007 government-funded study found the area had an unusually high rate of thyroid cancers, and noted evidence that thyroid-disrupting contaminants from the lab had leaked into off-site groundwater. The scientists said there were too few cases to draw any conclusions about childhood cancers.

No government-sponsored research has been done since 2007, but activists say they have documented at least 81 children with cancer within 20 miles of the Boeing site. The cases include leukemia, rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma and aggressive and fatal brain cancers.

In response to questions, Boeing sent Reuters links to studies, reports, memos and a professor's slideshow that had mixed conclusions. Some did not find unusual cancer rates, while others found elevated rates only in some types of cancers.

Bumstead, who founded Parents Against Santa Susana Field Lab in 2017, said she sees Boeing’s conservation easement as the latest in a long line of greenwashing tactics to avoid cleanup. Though none of the cleanup scenarios the state is considering would require a complete cleanup of the site, her grassroots group is determined to keep pressing for that outcome.

Jen Connell joined Bumstead’s efforts and began tracking brain cancers in the area after her husband, Mike, was diagnosed in September 2020 at age 48 with glioblastoma, a rare and aggressive brain cancer linked to radiation exposure. Activists have documented at least 20 cases of the cancer within 20 miles of the former field lab. Half were diagnosed after the 2018 Woolsey fire that started at Santa Susana. Reuters reviewed fundraising posts, statements from relatives, and obituaries for some of the cases.

The couple was married for 20 years with two teenage sons. Mike lived all but two years of his life less than five miles downhill from the Santa Susana Field Lab. The other two were spent living near another toxic waste site.

Mike believed the 2018 wildfire stirred up radiation that caused his cancer. In his last Facebook post, five months before his death, he reflected on living in the shadow of Santa Susana and recalled playing near the field lab as a kid.

“We used to hear the rocket test motors daily,” he said. “Those Rocketdyne hills have always been a hot spot over the years and now … the 2018 fires have spread all this existing mess across Simi Valley.”

He passed away in his wife’s arms on April 6th, after 19 months and three surgeries fighting cancer.",How Boeing created a nature preserve that may also preserve pollution

The air carrier ordered 100 new Dreamliners with options to add 100 more in the future, as well as ordering up to 100 Boeing 737 Max aircraft.

“With this investment in its future fleet, the 737 Max and 787 will help United accelerate its fleet modernization and global growth strategy,” said Stan Deal, president and CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes.

Flying Green

Part of the fleet modernization includes the pursuit of reducing the air carrier’s carbon emissions

United intends to replace its older Boeing 767s and 777s with about 100 of the new widebody aircraft, with all 767 aircraft removed from its fleet by 2030. Culling the older aircraft is projected to decrease per-seat carbon emissions by 25 percent, the airline said.

United has set the goal of reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 100 percent by 2050, without relying on traditional carbon offsets. It’s not alone in setting ambitious environmental goals. Earlier this year, Boeing said it intends for its commercial airplane fleet to be certified to fly on 100 percent SAF by 2030.

Boeing has also worked to reduce the noise footprint for the 787, reducing the sound of the jet by as much as 60 percent over that of the jets it is replacing.

The manufacturer also noted the 737 Max is designed for improved fuel efficiency in the single-aisle market, as the 737 Max reduces fuel use and CO2 emissions by 20 percent compared to the airplanes it replaces, depending on the configuration.

Looking Ahead: More Pilots

The expansion of United’s fleet means, however, it will need to hire more pilots. The airline reports hiring 2,400 pilots in 2022, with plans to add more than 2,500 pilots in 2023 with an ultimate goal of hiring 10,000 new pilots by the end of the decade. In order to do this, United opened the United Aviate Academy, which company officials predict will train some 5,000 new pilots by 2030.

“This order solves for our current widebody replacement needs in a more fuel-efficient and cost-efficient way, while also giving our customers a best-in-class experience,” said Gerry Laderman, United’s EVP and chief financial officer. “And if the future of long-haul flying is as bright as we think it will be, United is able to capitalize on those opportunities by exercising these new widebody options—I look forward to the incremental margin and earnings these aircraft will generate.”",United’s Big Boeing Purchase Set to Advance Its Ambitious Climate Goals

From world-recognized companies to small manufacturers, it seems every organization is trying its hand at making aerospace a cleaner, greener industry. Like many other companies, Boeing has committed to the widely agreed-upon goal of net zero emission by 2050 and unveiled the Cascade data modeling tool, which outlines the most effective scenarios for reaching this goal.

“We are embarked as pioneers on a new science and industry…Our job is to keep everlastingly at research and experiment, to adapt our laboratories to production as soon as practicable.” - Boeing founder Bill Boeing in 1929.

Boeing chief sustainability officer Chris Raymond shared this quote at the beginning of Boeing's media briefing on Monday as a source of inspiration. The earth faces a climate crisis as increasing emissions have caused a significant rise in global temperatures over the past century and many industries have begun to step up to the challenge of reducing emissions. Driving and flying less isn’t an option in today’s mobile, globalized world. Studies cited during Boeing’s briefing suggest that by 2050, 70 percent of the world’s population will live in big cities, with constant movement within and between metropoles. As the energy industry looks into infrastructure and power sources that can support such a society sustainably, the same is being done with air travel. Currently, aviation accounts for 2.6 percent of global emissions, and 12 percent of transportation-related emissions. While that poses a challenge, it also presents an opportunity to pioneer a new industry, as Boeing believes, one of sustainable aviation.

Sustainable aviation, Raymond explained, must go beyond the work already done in fuel efficiency and must enter an era of sustainable product life cycles. This is where Boeing's Cascade data modeling tool comes into play. ""There are multiple ways to a future where aviation has zero climate impact,"" he said. ""We created Cascade on a foundation of credible data and analytical models to allow users to explore various pathways to net-zero. We think this model will help our industry visualize, for the first time, the real climate impact of each solution, from beginning to end, and to inform the most probable and effective strategies.""

Boeing created Cascade to depict and consider the different paths to decarbonization and their potential ability to reduce emissions. The platform considers four strategies: airplane fleet renewal; renewable energy sources such as sustainable fuel, hydrogen, and electric propulsion; operational efficiency improvements; and advanced technologies. The model also assesses the lifecycle impacts of renewable energy by accounting for the emissions required to produce, distribute, and use alternative energies like sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The plan is to use the tool with airline operators, industry partners, and policymakers to determine when, where, and how different fuel sources intersect with new aircraft design. “Product development tells you what you can do—product strategy tells you what you should do,"" said Mike Sinnett, Boeing v-p and general manager of product development. ""Cascade is a tool to tell us what we should do."" Cascade is about to undergo beta testing, after which it will be made available to the industry.

SAF plays an increasingly crucial role in sustainable aviation, asserts Boeing. ""We have to take a holistic view to decarbonization,"" said Raymond. ""And when we do that, it is clear that SAF is a necessary lever. We know it will take a 'SAF and' approach and not a 'SAF or' approach to achieving net-zero by 2050. It’s SAF and whatever else we can do.”

As part of that stance, Boeing has continued to explore the safety and viability of alternative fuels. Since the mid-2000s, the company has conducted demonstrations using hydrogen fuel cells and combustion engines. Last year, they successfully tested a cryotank designed to hold 16,000 gallons of liquid hydrogen—equivalent to the fuel carried in a regional jet.

Beyond SAF, Boeing has invested in an electric-powered aircraft through its joint venture, Wisk, which is working to bring an all-electric, autonomous air taxi to market.

Informed by its continued evaluation and testing of alternative propulsion sources, Boeing also shared its “Future Flight Concepts,” depictions of how aircraft need to change and evolve for the alternatively powered pathways that the industry is headed towards.

“Is this too ambitious of a goal for the industry to get to net zero by 2050?” asked Brian Yutko, Boeing chief engineer and v-p of sustainability and future mobility. “Yes, it’s ambitious. There will be a generation of engineers whose life goals are to accomplish what we’ve talked about here. To make that a reality, we believe it is best to learn and share our findings broadly, based on a foundation of data, scientific research, and collaboration as we work together to decarbonize aviation.""

A question remains for large aerospace and defense companies. Is the defense sector moving forward on the same path of sustainability, at the same pace, or is there a risk of falling behind? Boeing sees the two sides of the industry—commercial and military—as maintaining a symbiotic relationship, as each sector learns from the other, but only time will tell if that results in beneficial sustainability results for both sectors.

As for commercial aviation, there are countless questions and even more tests to run, but the industry seems to have united as pioneers for a cleaner future. As Raymond reminded the room: “What Bill Boeing said about pioneers in 1929 is relevant to sustainable aerospace today.”",Boeing Data Modeling Tool To Improve Sustainability Efforts

Although Airbus also advocates for the increased availability of SAF, the European company sees a more prominent role for hydrogen in the nearer term and plans to introduce a hydrogen-powered narrowbody airliner by 2035.

The extent to which the U.S. company’s view on hydrogen contrasts with that of Airbus went on display during a series of media briefings in Seattle in mid-June, as Boeing chief sustainability officer Chris Raymond called for the need to understand the “realities” and relative benefits of various alternative fuel types, including hydrogen and electric.

Reflecting on his company’s considerable experience with fuel cells and cryogenic hydrogen production over the past decade and a half, Raymond didn’t reject those avenues’ potential but cautioned that their large-scale application will require far more development time than some would suggest. He cited Boeing’s own studies on hydrogen power—including the world’s first piloted hydrogen fuel cell-powered aircraft in 2008 and an airplane powered by liquid-hydrogen combustion engine in 2012—as if to underscore the company’s knowledge of its limitations and challenges.

Raymond also cited early lessons learned from studies Boeing and NASA recently completed on a 37,000-gallon carbon-fiber hydrogen fuel tank. “If you convert that to equivalent energy for jet fuel, it's about 3,700 gallons of jet fuel, which is about what powers a regional jet, but the cross-section of [the tank] is about the size of a regional jet,” he explained, highlighting the scale challenges liquid hydrogen presents for application on an aircraft.

“And by the way, the white stuff that you see on there is called frost,” he added, referring to a photograph in his Powerpoint presentation. “So how are we going to deal with that at 30,000 feet? And how are we going to deal with the water that we create with hydrogen fuel cells at 30,000 feet, especially contrails, which are all coming into our vocabulary now as a component of carbon emission? We have to understand how to deal with contrail formation on a hydrogen fuel cell airplane. And we're studying that.”

Raymond also cited the lifecycle challenges associated with hydrogen production, which with the technology now available generates its own greenhouse gasses. Large-scale production of so-called green hydrogen with techniques such as electrolysis and steam methane reforming will take many years and involve an evolutionary, rather than revolutionary, process.

“A lot of it is what you believe about how fast the grids are going to change to renewable electricity,” said Raymond. “I don't believe we're going to just sort of get to this Nirvana state eventually. I think there'll be a migration over the years. And I actually think as we start to introduce things like industrial carbon capture, you can make some of the fuel pathways cleaner…and people are starting to do that now.”

More immediately and even for the near future, though, Boeing has turned its focus to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) as the most promising avenue for reducing greenhouse gasses, particularly given the volume of fuel burned on long-distance flights. Raymond noted that 50 percent of all flights don’t exceed 1,000 kilometers but they account for only 15 percent of all the fuel used. Meanwhile, roughly 10 percent of all flights extend beyond 2,800 kilometers but they account for half of all the fuel burned. Given that even Airbus acknowledges that hydrogen-powered widebodies won’t become feasible for several years after the first narrowbody propelled by hydrogen reaches the market, the role of SAF as a primary emissions reduction measure will extend far beyond 2035, argues Boeing.

Pledging to ensure all its commercial airplanes can fly on and gain certification to use 100 percent sustainable aviation fuels by 2030, Boeing points to its partnerships with airlines, industry, governments, and research institutions to expand limited SAF supplies and reduce the fuels' cost as evidence of its environmental credentials. The airframer worked with airlines, engine manufacturers, and others to conduct biofuel test flights starting in 2008 and gain approval for sustainable fuels in 2011. In 2018, the Boeing ecoDemonstrator flight-test program made the world's first commercial airplane flight using 100 percent sustainable fuels with a 777 Freighter in collaboration with FedEx Express. Its most recent ecoDemonstrator, a former Singapore Airlines 777-200ER unveiled on June 16, will also test the effects of SAF on emissions reduction along with about another 30 sustainability and safety-related technologies.

Although he didn’t dismiss the potential for hydrogen to serve as one avenue for reaching the industry’s net-zero emissions goals, Raymond clearly sees SAF as the most important way forward, at least for now.

“We have put a lot of our voice on sustainable aviation fuel as one of the forms of that renewable energy,” he said. “There's a lot of room to run in sustainable aviation fuel. There's room to scale up the production of it. And there's also room to scale up the innovation around it. And the fuels we all have in our heads as sustainable aviation fuels today are going to change. There are going to be new feedstocks. We're going to introduce carbon capture into the process. Hydrogen's going to get greener as a component of the process.”",Boeing Preaches Pragmatism in Setting Sustainability Priorities

Airbus Ventures led the round and was joined by AEI HorizonX–a joint venture between Boeing and leading private equity firm AE Industrial Partners–as well as GPVC, Stellar Ventures, Industrious Ventures and others.

A Solestial announcement says the new funding will be used to ramp up production and customer engagement as the company expands ground and flight testing. It will also fund research and development and sales and marketing activities.

Solestial’s core technology, which it has been working on for a decade as an Arizona State University spinout, is an “ultra-thin” silicon solar cell that can self-cure radiation damage at normal operating temperatures in space, the company says. It is packaged in a “flexible, lightweight panel designed to achieve minimum degradation for up to 10 years in LEO.” What is more, the panels can be mass-produced using automation, resulting in 90% lower costs than incumbent technologies and “virtually unlimited” manufacturing capacity.

“From the start of our diligence process, we were instantly impressed by Solestial’s solar cell technology, and we’re proud to be leading this impressive syndicate on a mission to help deliver advanced, lightweight, cost-effective solutions that power the new space economy,” says Mat Costes, partner at Airbus Ventures.

Boeing Research & Technology chief technology officer, vice president and general manager Todd Citron speaks during a news conference to discuss the agency’s Sustainable Flight Demonstrator project ‘to develop technology and designs for a new generation of lower-emission single-aisle airliners’ at the James Webb Auditorium of NASA Headquarters on Jan. 18, 2023, in Washington, DC. AFP

NASA, whose purview also includes aeronautical research, will invest $425 million over seven years in the “Sustainable Flight Demonstrator” project, while Boeing and its partners will spend an estimated $725 million.

The goal is to produce future commercial airliners that are “more fuel efficient, with benefits to the environment, the commercial aviation industry, and to passengers worldwide,” NASA chief Bill Nelson said.

“If we are successful, we may see these technologies in planes that the public takes to the skies in the 2030s,” Nelson said in a statement on Wednesday.

The agreement calls for NASA and Boeing to build, test, and fly a full-scale single-aisle demonstrator aircraft.

“The technologies demonstrated and tested as part of the SFD program will inform future designs and could lead to breakthrough aerodynamics and fuel efficiency gains,” Boeing said.

Boeing chief engineer Greg Hyslop said it “has the potential to make a major contribution toward a sustainable future.”

Engineers will be seeking to design an aircraft with fuel consumption and emissions reductions of up to 30 percent relative to today’s most efficient single-aisle aircraft, NASA said.

The agency plans to complete SFD testing by the late 2020s so the technologies and design can be applied to the next generation of single-aisle aircraft.

Single-aisle aircraft are the most common in airline fleets and account for nearly half of the worldwide aviation emissions, NASA said.

Boeing and NASA plan to flight-test an innovative wing known as the transonic truss-braced wing that creates less drag and results in the burning of less fuel.

The extra-long, thin wings are mounted on top of the fuselage and stabilized by diagonal struts.

NASA and Boeing said the development of the next-generation plane could help meet the White House and industry’s objective of net-zero carbon emissions from aviation by 2050.

The initiative is a part of a newly expanded cooperation agreement with Meti. In 2019, the two entities signed an agreement to strengthen innovative aircraft technologies, including advanced batteries, motors and controllers.

Greg Hyslop, Boeing’s chief engineer, said in the statement: “Working with terrific partners like METI, the new centre will expand upon Boeing-wide initiatives in sustainable fuels and electrification and explore the intersection of digitisation, automation and high-performance aerospace composites for greater sustainability in our future products and production systems.”

The new facility will be located in Nagoya, where many of Boeing’s industrial partners and suppliers are based. It will expand the company’s R&D footprint in Asia, which currently includes facilities in Australia, China and South Korea. The company currently has 11 R&D centres globally.

Additionally, Boeing said that it has become a partner in Act For Sky, a voluntary organisation founded by 16 Japanese companies in March 2022, which works to commercialise and expand the use of SAF in Japan.

SAF is a cleaner alternative to conventional fossil jet fuel produced with sustainable feedstocks including cooking oil and solid waste from homes and businesses. SAF can reduce aeroplane carbon emissions by up to 80%, according to the International Air Transport Association, and has attracted significant recent investments this year.

In June, Australian flagship air carrier Qantas and Boeing’s European rival Airbus announced plans to partner and invest up to $200m to fast track the establishment of a SAF industry in Australia.

Meanwhile, Boeing has signed sustainability agreements with All Nippon Airways (ANA) and Japan Airlines (JAL), which both use Boeing aircrafts as part of their fleets. The companies will work together on research into advanced sustainable technologies, including electric, hybrid, hydrogen and other propulsion systems.

Boeing has previously collaborated with the two Japanese airlines on SAF-powered flights. In February 2021, JAL operated a commercial flight using jet fuel blended with SAF between Fukuoka and Tokyo Haneda airports.

JAL and ANA are both members of the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Users Group, which includes 25 member airlines as well as Boeing and Airbus. Boeing has committed that all its commercial aircrafts will be compatible and capable of flying with 100% SAF by 2030.",Boeing to establish R&D centre in Japan for sustainability and electrification

The wings for the final 747-8 freighter, line number LN 1574, were loaded on the line almost 54 years after the final body join of the first aircraft in the summer of 1968 and comes 54 years and 8 months after the initial wing skin/stringer riveting machine began work on the first units at Everett in September 1967.

All four of the final aircraft are due for delivery to cargo carrier Atlas Air by the end of 2022, Boeing says. The first of the group, which were ordered by Atlas in January 2021, is LN 1571, which made its first flight on April 22 and is expected to deliver soon having made its fourth shake-down flight on May 17.

The second aircraft, LN1572, is undergoing final body join on the production line in Everett’s Building 40-22. The wing set for LN1573 is meanwhile being prepared for mating with the center fuselage section prior to transfer to the final body join position. Systems installation for the forward and aft fuselage sections of the second-to-last 747-8 is meanwhile underway in the adjacent build-up area on the north-west side of 40-22.

Boeing confirmed in 2020 it would terminate production of the 747 in 2022. Previously, the company had hoped to extend deliveries into 2023 but was forced to bring the production date cut off forward after the backlog shrank following order losses after financial problems at the Volga-Dnepr Group in Russia.

With the end of 747 production Boeing is preparing to bolster spares provisioning for the in-service fleet through Boeing Global Services, as well as clearing out space in 40-22 and the adjacent wing build-up area in 40-21. Following the consolidation of the 767/KC-46A and 747 line functions in 2016, and the transition of the 787 to Charleston, South Carolina, in 2021, the clearance of the 747 line will open up even more spare capacity in Everett. Boeing says no decisions have yet been taken on what to do with the space.

To-date Boeing has produced 1,569 747s of which the bulk—694—were 747-400s. The last variant of this model, a -400F, was delivered in December 2009.

The futures were trading mixed, as we kicked off March trading with all the major indexes finishing the day down, with the exception of the Dow Jones industrials, which scratched out a tiny gain. While the market started higher early in the session after positive purchasing managers data out of China, stocks turned negative fast as once again interest rates continue to press higher. Rising interest rates were cited as a big headwind, as was the likelihood that earnings estimates will continue to deteriorate as the year moves along. In addition, geopolitical tensions around the world are ramping up as the Russia-Ukraine war spills into its second year.

The aforementioned Treasury yields climbed across all maturities Wednesday. The 10-year note pushed back to the 4% level for the first time since November of 2022. Higher rates are also pressuring home buyers again as applications for mortgages plunged last week and are down 44% year over year.

Boeing launched the ecoDemonstrator programme in 2012 to improve efficiency, minimise the environmental footprint and enhance safety in aviation. Over a decade, the ecoDemonstrator programme has evaluated 230 technologies, including many that have reduced fuel use, emissions and noise, and greater use of sustainable materials. According to Boeing, the continuous testing resulted in a much better understanding of reducing noise emissions from commercial jetliners.

Rae Lutters, EcoDemonstrator Programme Manager, Boeing, said, “Since 2012, we’ve tested more than 200 technologies, and we have found that a third of those technologies have made it into our products and services, and those technologies aid in the reduction of noise, reduction of fuel, cleaner emissions, the safety of the passengers and environmental impacts. Our ecoDemonstrator motto is: Innovate, collaborate and accelerate, and we’ve held to that motto since we started in 2012.”

The ecoDemonstrator programme has delivered several technologies that have transitioned into commercial use on Boeing jetliners. These include the aerodynamically efficient winglets on the 737 MAX, iPad apps that provide real-time weather and other information to pilots, enabling them to improve fuel efficiency and reduce emissions, custom approach path information to lower community noise and flight deck touch-screen displays and a camera system on the 777X that have enhanced flight safety by helping pilots avoid ground obstacles.

Since 2012, the ecoDemonstrator programme has used nine different aircraft types in the B737-800, 737-9 MAX, B787-8 and 787-10, B757, Embraer E170, B777-200, B777 Freighter and the 777-200ER (Extended Range).

Testing Technologies

The 2022 ecoDemonstrator programme commenced in June with Boeing opting to use a company-owned B777-200ER widebody jetliner. Boeing is testing 30 new technologies to improve sustainability and safety for the aerospace industry over six months of flight and ground tests. The 2022 ecoDemonstrator will fly on the highest approved blend of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) available for all flight tests. Boeing will use a 30/70 blend of SAF and conventional jet fuel throughout the test period on the 777-200ER test aircraft.

In 2021, Boeing launched a multi-year partnership with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to collect and analyse data on SAF emissions. Boeing and NASA have been performing ground testing on engine particles and trace gas emissions with various blends of SAF. This was conducted alongside a demonstration flight with 100% SAF in one engine. The testing took place in October 2021 at Boeing Field in Seattle on that year’s ecoDemonstrator aircraft, an Alaska Airlines 737-MAX 9 powered by CFM International LEAP-1B engines.

The project's goals were to quantify these engine emissions while burning 100% SAF for the first time and compare the results to those obtained for conventional, petroleum-based Jet A fuel and blends of the SAF with Jet A. The four investigated jet fuels were: 100 % SAF, 50% SAF – 50% Jet A Blend, 30% SAF – 70% Jet A Blend and 100% conventional, petroleum-based Jet A Fuel. Earlier in the ecoDemonstrator programme in 2018, Boeing, in partnership with FedEx Express, conducted the world’s first commercial airliner test flight flown on 100% SAF in both engines.

Among the other technologies being tested this year include SMART vortex generators and small vertical vanes installed on the wing, improving aerodynamic efficiency during take-off and landing. Boeing is collaborating with NASA to test these vortex generators. While these are commonplace in aviation, Boeing and NASA continue their work on SMART vortex generators, which use shape memory alloys developed in collaboration with the latter. These SMART vortex generators can retract into the wing during cruise, improving fuel efficiency and reducing carbon emissions.

Boeing will also trial additively manufactured airplane and engine parts which will be lighter and less complex to manufacture, thus helping reduce fuel use and manufacturing waste. The use of additive manufactured parts on commercial jetliners will have dramatic benefits in the future. Boeing is now testing an additively manufactured Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) exhaust duct support panel and an engine bracket, which will provide significant weight savings and be easier to manufacture. Boeing’s Additive Manufacturing Innovation Center developed the APU exhaust duct support panel and engine bracket.

The ecoDemonstrator pilots also test the next-generation head-worn Head-Up Display (HUD) and an enhanced vision system (EVS) camera. The SkyLens HUD is a transparent screen that places key information directly within a pilot’s line of sight and is being tested by Boeing in partnership with Universal Avionics. The future use of such an enhanced vision system will allow pilots to see in low-visibility conditions, thereby enhancing safety by improving situational awareness. This newly enhanced vision system is also expected to be significantly lighter than existing technologies in this domain.

Boeing has committed to eliminating the use of Halon 1301 (the standard agent for extinguishing airplane fires) across all its commercial airplane models. Due to its ozone-depleting properties, international environmental and aviation regulations have already imposed cut-off dates for using Halon 1301. As a result, the airframer is testing the discharge performance of a new fire suppression agent for the airplane’s cargo compartment in flight, which is being done in partnership with Meggit. The programme is a continuation of the 2021 ecoDemonstrator; also being tested is a new air chiller that uses an environmentally-preferred refrigerant, done in partnership with Collins Aerospace. Such environment-friendly refrigerants could find future use in airplane galleys which contain refrigerators to keep food and beverages cold in flight.

The 2022 ecoDemonstrator programme also tests a water conservation system that uses wastewater from handwashing to flush the lavatories. Boeing is undertaking this work in partnership with Diehl Aviation, which could result in potential weight savings per flight of 181 kg.

Building On Progress

Boeing’s 2021 ecoDemonstrator Programme saw it partner with Alaska Airlines to use its modified 737-9 aircraft. The five-month programme was completed in December 2021 and included participation from Cobham, Inmarsat, Hanwha and AvionX. The 2021 ecoDemonstrator programme was used to flight test about 20 technologies. Following the completion of testing, Boeing was to reconfigure the aircraft for passenger service and deliver the aircraft to the Alaskan carrier by the middle of this year.

The primary focus was testing advanced technologies to reduce aircraft emissions and noise. A new engine nacelle design was evaluated during flight testing, in which the 737-9 demonstrator aircraft’s right engine nacelle was modified with advanced acoustic liners and other treatments made to the thrust reverser. The new engine nacelle was tested with the dual objective of reducing noise emissions from current-generation engines and from next-generation ultra-high bypass engines with compact nacelles. Next-generation ultra-high bypass engines will be shorter and have larger diameter fans than present engines. The testing undertaken in 2021 was meant to generate data to guide the designs for next-generation models.

Boeing also tested a cabin sidewall panel made from recycled carbon composite material left over from the manufacture of wings for its new 777X widebody jetliner. The cabin sidewall panel was subjected to acoustic testing to ensure that it met Boeing’s performance requirements, including noise and weight reduction. The use of carbon fibre material left over from the composite airplane manufacturing process would help reduce waste going to landfills from future airplane designs.

The company reported 29 total 737 MAX deliveries for May. Aviation Week Fleet Discovery figures show seven were built in 2019, while the rest rolled out in either 2021 or 2022, or after the model’s 21-month delivery pause ended in December 2020. Counting last month’s activity, Boeing has delivered 250 737 MAXs from the batch of about 460 pre-December 2020 roll-outs that had built up during the pause.

Boeing has been eyeing the end of 2023 as a notional target for clearing out the stored inventory. That requires delivering 35-40 aircraft per month, including about 11 from storage plus a total equivalent to its monthly production rate, which currently sits somewhere between 25 and 30.

The company has not surpassed 40 737 MAX deliveries in any single month since the December 2020 restart and has topped 30 deliveries just three times. Total deliveries in 2022 so far number 138—an average of about 28 per month. Deliveries from inventory have fallen from 16 in March to 11 in April and then into single digits in May.

Other May activity included a sale-leaseback transaction that saw India’s Akasa Air cancel five 737 MAX orders and Bain Capital Griffin book them as new orders. Norwegian also canceled four 787-9s. The majority of Boeing’s 23 gross orders for the month came from Lufthansa Group, which committed to 16 widebodies: seven 787-9s, two 777Fs and seven 777-8Fs. Rounding out the orders, American Airlines purchased one 737 MAX and Eva Air one 777F.

But for policymakers whose decisions shape the economy, this is a serious and practical question. It’s one that arises the most sharply in prosperous, progressive urban areas where ambitious climate goals collide with an ever-growing demand for freight transport and economic activity of all kinds. For example, here in King County, where just such a conflict has been brewing around the airport.

I’m not talking about the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, which is its own can of climate worms. I’m talking about the King County International Airport, also known as Boeing Field.

This publicly owned and operated airport extends from the southern end of Georgetown in South Seattle down into the northern tip of Tukwila, with Interstate 5 to the east and the Duwamish River to the west. Once a horse racetrack, then a dairy farm, Boeing Field was Seattle’s main passenger airport from 1928 through the 1940s, when the U.S. military commandeered it for wartime use and commercial traffic shifted to the new Sea-Tac airport. As King County’s website explains, the King County International Airport now “serves small commercial passenger airlines, cargo carriers, private aircraft owners, helicopters, corporate jets, and military and other aircraft,” as well as hosting various Boeing Co. operations.

KCIA also accounts for a chunk of the county’s greenhouse gas emissions. How big a chunk? King County’s 2017 emissions inventory estimates that commercial airports, namely Sea-Tac and KCIA, account for 10% of transportation emissions and 3.6% of total emissions. But there are a couple of problems with these numbers.

For one, the inventory accounts only for carbon dioxide emitted during takeoff and landing, which is estimated at 10% of the fuel dispensed on site. If every jurisdiction uses this formula, then the 90% of aviation emissions produced in transit will never be inventoried — no one’s responsibility, everyone’s problem.

Second, says Sarah Shifley, a volunteer with the aviation team of the climate action group 350 Seattle, aviation emissions have a warming impact three times greater than on-the-ground emissions, due to a combination of altitude, contrail formation and a potent cocktail of non-CO₂ compounds. Adjusting for this “radiative forcing factor” and including all tailpipe emissions from fuel pumped in King County, one arrives at a much higher number: Aviation emissions are responsible for over half of King County’s total climate impact. KCIA, Shifley estimates, probably accounts for a hefty 10%.

That makes the KCIA Master Plan Update, now underway, a big deal. King County is proposing to expand operations at the airport, increasing its footprint by acquiring new property, lengthening the runway, enlarging the fuel farm and constructing new airplane parking. King County’s nouveau riche need to store their private jets somewhere, after all. Cargo, charter and corporate jet traffic are all expected to notch up. The Master Plan Update forecasts that this expansion will mean a 30% increase in CO₂ emissions by 2035.

Needless to say, this will not help to achieve King County’s climate goals, which include slashing countywide sources of greenhouse gas emissions 50% by 2030 and 80% by 2050, compared with a 2007 baseline. (Back in 2008, King County aspired to a 25% reduction by 2020; the latest data, from 2017, show a decrease of less than 2%.)

But opposition to the proposed airport expansion goes beyond the climate crisis. Holly Krejci, a resident of Georgetown since 2003, says that increased air and noise pollution are high on the list of her neighbors’ concerns. Krejci serves on the Georgetown Community Council and on the Roundtable, a board that advises KCIA administrators and King County elected officials on matters related to the airport.

“In the Duwamish Valley we have a 13-year reduction in life expectancy compared to our neighbors in Laurelhurst,” she says, and eight years shorter than the Seattle average. That’s partly a result of dangerously high levels of fine particulates in the air, of which the airport is one cause among many. Children in Georgetown and South Park, across the Duwamish River from the airport, suffer high rates of hospitalization for asthma. A large majority of South Park residents are low-income people of color.

Concerns like these led to the formation of the KCIA Community Coalition late last year. The Georgetown Community Council and 350 Seattle are both members, as are a number of other groups, including the Duwamish River Cleanup Coalition, Duwamish Valley Safe Streets and the Beacon Hill Council — another neighborhood that bears the brunt of aviation pollution.

Especially frustrating to community members is KCIA’s habit of making decisions without consultation, or inviting review only after plans are already basically baked. The airport recently moved its helicopter training facilities over to the west side of the airfield, with no analysis of how that might affect the Georgetown neighborhood. Helicopters now fly right over people’s homes. The expansion proposed in the Master Plan Update would extend the airplane runway 300 feet north, closer to Georgetown.

The coalition’s chair, former state representative Velma Veloria, says the airport needs to better engage with the people affected by its operations. “These communities, Georgetown and South Park in particular, have been neglected and we want to make sure they are addressed,” she says.

KCIA “wants to be a world class airport,” says Krejci. “When do you ask the neighborhood that you’re in what being a world class airport is to us? How do we co-create that? How might we do it with, not at the expense of the neighbors? How do we do that together?”

Advocates already have one victory under their belt, successfully pressing the King County Council to include aviation emissions for the first time in a new climate plan approved last month. That commits the county to start tracking emissions from air traffic and to create a community task force to make recommendations. But it doesn’t immediately help with the KCIA Master Plan Update. That will soon be on the desk of King County Executive Dow Constantine, waiting for action.

The community coalition is urging Constantine to do two things immediately. First, excise from the plan any projects that would expand capacity, including lengthening the runway, enlarging the fuel farm, increasing the airport’s physical footprint and constructing new parking areas or hangars. Second, mandate a full environmental impact statement, including an environmental justice analysis, before sending the plan to the council for approval.

Asked for comment, Constantine’s office told me: “The Executive met recently with the KCIA Community Coalition and is considering their feedback on the Master Plan process.”

Not so long ago, the idea of halting an airport expansion over climate concerns might have seemed far-fetched. But times are changing. Earlier this year, the French government canceled a planned expansion of the country’s largest airport, citing climate change. The U.K. High Court quashed plans to turn Manston Airport into a global freight hub, and the U.K.’s Climate Change Committee recently recommended no net airport expansion.

The coalition’s second demand has a direct precedent in King County; back in 1998, former County Executive Ron Sims required a full environmental impact statement of that year’s KCIA Master Plan Update.

So, will Dow do it? On one side of the scale are, I’m sure, many, many reasons to move forward with the airport expansion as planned. On the other side is the unimaginably weighty reality that if people in positions of power don’t start making tough decisions like this real quick, we’re all screwed. I guess we’ll just wait and see.","Facing climate concerns, will King County stop Boeing Field expansion?"

“Perhaps conscious of the growing international pressure for aircraft manufacturers to reduce the environmental impact of their products, Boeing has smartly made sustainability a key feature in its upcoming Farnborough showcase.

“Boeing’s sustainable aviation showcase will focus on fuel-efficient aircraft, sustainable aviation fuel, and a modelling tool which will aid in the formulation of emission-reduction strategies in the aerospace sector. Whilst this tool is a novel development set to be unveiled at Farnborough, it will likely build on other sustainability tools developed by the company such as the Emissions Reporter, which was first used by Air Astana in 2021.

“The company has also announced that the 737 MAX 10 will make its international debut at the show. The 737 MAX 10 is one of the most fuel-efficient aircraft in its class. The incorporation of fuel-efficient aircraft, sustainable aviation fuels, and other green technologies into global commercial airline fleets are all tools which can help to bring down emissions in the near and medium term whilst other technologies such as hydrogen propulsion are brought to maturity.

“However, the 737 MAX 10 still faces hurdles before it can enter service, not least gaining Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification. The aircraft has reportedly been making progress with regulators, but the company and FAA have declined to offer a definite timeline.

“The issue is further complicated because if certification is not attained by December 27, 2022, a re-design may be necessary to comply with new legislation in the US regarding flight crew alerting systems. A re-design could then affect commonality across 737 MAX types, affecting training requirements for pilots, and so potentially decreasing the attractiveness of the aircraft in the eyes of operators.”

(AP) — Boeing will spend millions of dollars and decades cleaning up pollutants that have seeped into the soil and groundwater beneath one of their plants in Washington state, a state-mandated draft proposal said.

TCE, or Trichloroethylene, is one of many pollutants that have been found in groundwater near Boeing’s Everett, Washington, plant, the Daily Herald reported Sunday.

TCE is a solvent that is used to degrease metal parts and is a carcinogen to humans. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said in 2016 that TCE can also affect fetus development, irritate the respiratory system and cause light-headedness, drowsiness and headaches.

The National Cancer Institute considers TCE a “cancer-causing substance.”

Last year, the solvent was detected in groundwater near the plant at a concentration more than 1,000 times the state limit.

“Boeing is in the final stages of environmental cleanup at our Everett site, under a draft set of studies, plans and orders and other documents available for public comment from the Washington Department of Ecology,” the company said in a written statement. “We are committed to a comprehensive cleanup of the Powder Mill Gulch area of Everett and have made considerable progress in reducing groundwater contamination through a variety of interim action cleanup activities.”

The full cost of the cleanup is not publicly known. Boeing declined to say what the cleanup is expected to cost.

Several other contaminants have been discovered at the roughly 1,000-acre (405 hectares) Boeing site. The contaminants include fuels such as oil, gasoline, lead, hydraulic jet fluid, polychlorinated biphenyls and carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.

The chemicals came from a range of manufacturing operations, according to the cleanup documents.

Boeing “no longer uses TCE as a widespread cleaning solvent as it did in the past,” the department said. Small quantities of the chemical are still used in one of its labs, according to the Washington State Department of Ecology.

The most expensive and time-consuming part of the Everett cleanup plan involves a process known as bioremediation, in which Boeing will inject nutrients into the soil to help natural bacteria break down TCE. Boeing would invest heavily in improvements to an existing system that pumps out contaminated groundwater, treats it then releases it, according to the proposal.

The state-mandated draft proposal is 163 pages and public comment closes on April 19.

Jan 31 (Reuters) - Boeing Co (BA.N) said on Monday the ongoing tensions between the United States and Russia over Ukraine were creating an ""adverse climate"" for its business and threatening to disrupt its supply chain.

Boeing relies heavily on Russia's VSMPO-AVISMA (VSMO.MM) for the supply of titanium, a lightweight metal that is used widely in planemaking.

Russia has massed tens of thousands of troops near Ukraine's border as it presses demands for a new security arrangement in Europe, prompting U.S. and European officials to threaten a barrage of sanctions if it invades.

The planemaker said it would monitor and evaluate for any sanctions or restrictions that might be imposed by the U.S. government and any responses from Russia that could directly affect company's supply chain, business partners or customers.

On Monday, U.S. President Joe Biden warned of ""swift and severe consequences"" from the United States and its allies if Moscow attacked Ukraine. read more

Western aerospace companies have shored up their stocks of titanium and are scrambling to bolster supply chains in case the metal is thrust into a potential trade war between Russia and the West. read more

Boeing Chief Executive David Calhoun said last week that the company is ""protected for quite a while, but not forever.""

Separately, the Chicago-based company said it was expecting negative operating cash flows in future quarters until deliveries start returning to historical levels.

The company also flagged that it might have to consider getting additional funding, if the pace and scope of the recovery worsened.

United States plane maker Boeing Co has backed fuel efficiency standards for new aircraft – the first of their kind – finalised by the Trump administration in its waning days that a dozen states have challenged as too lenient, and that President Joe Biden’s administration is reviewing.

The company asked a US appeals court in Washington, DC, for approval to intervene on behalf of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which is being sued over its decision to finalise the first-ever standards regulating greenhouse gas emissions from aeroplanes. The plaintiffs, 12 states, the District of Columbia and three environmental groups, want tougher emissions rules.

The states said late last year that the EPA rule lags “existing technology by more than 10 years and would result in no [greenhouse gas] reductions at all compared to business-as-usual”.

Commercial planes have been the largest source of transportation greenhouse gas emissions not subject to rules. In 2016, the United Nations’s International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) agreed on global aircraft emissions standards aimed at makers of small and large planes, including Airbus SE and Boeing Co, which both endorsed the rules.

Boeing noted the ICAO emissions standards effort began under former President Barack Obama’s administration, in which Biden was vice president.

‘Do-nothing rule’

The planemaker argued that it is “essential” that rules “be reasonably achievable, given the billions of dollars it costs to design, build, and certify new airplanes”.

“Attempts to overturn regulation directly aligned with successful cooperative international efforts to combat climate change, supported by more than 190 countries, will only discourage future international agreements,” Boeing said in a statement.

The EPA declined to comment to the Reuters news agency on Boeing’s filing.

In January, the Trump EPA said it did not expect the rule to result in emissions reductions and did not project it would “cause manufacturers to make technical improvements to their airplanes that would not have occurred” otherwise.

The Environmental Defense Fund has said the EPA’s “do-nothing rule is totally inadequate in light of the climate crisis.”

The new rules apply to new-type designs as of January 2020 and to aircraft already in production or those with amended type certificates starting in 2028.

Planes covered by the rule account for 10 percent of US transportation greenhouse gas emissions and 3 percent of total US emissions.

Separately, industry group the Aerospace Industries Association (AIA) in a letter released on Tuesday urged the Biden administration “to continue to prioritize multilateral solutions” on aircraft emissions.

The AIA also urged the Federal Aviation Administration to develop regulations to allow US manufacturers to certify aircraft to the global carbon dioxide standard. “Our industry is ready to work with the Biden Administration to improve the sustainability of air travel,” the AIA wrote.",Boeing backs Trump plane emission rule seen by US states as weak

The new agreement will focus on enhancing the efficiency of navigation and flight operations, airframe technologies and sustainable practices to reduce Etihad's fuel use and emissions. In addition, company leaders said their partnership provides an opportunity to validate concepts that could be scaled up to benefit the broader aviation industry.

""Sustainability is a core principle at Etihad, and we believe our continued collaboration with Boeing will drive further innovation in this critical area for the airline and our industry,"" said Tony Douglas, group chief executive of Etihad Aviation Group. ""With the highly efficient 787 Dreamliner in our fleet, Etihad has considerably reduced its overall carbon emissions, and our expanded sustainability alliance with Boeing will drive further innovations.""

Etihad is the largest 787 operator in the Middle East, benefiting from the Dreamliner family's superior efficiency. The agreement also includes collaboration to develop tools for flight planning, arrival and departure procedures, en-route flight optimization and community noise reduction.

""Partnership is critically important to decarbonize our industry, and we are honored to work side-by-side with Etihad to advance sustainable aviation,"" said Stan Deal, Boeing Commercial Airplanes president and chief executive officer. ""Our flight test programs and other joint efforts have clearly demonstrated the value of collaboration by our companies and our industry.""

To support this drive for operational efficiency, Boeing will provide multiple services for the Etihad's 787 fleet including charting and Electronic Flight Bag navigational tools that provide pilots with real-time advisories to adjust course, altitude and speed to optimize fuel use and routing. Also, the two companies will collaborate on ways to reduce emissions at Etihad's facilities, further the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and increase sustainable financing.

In 2020, as part of the Boeing ecoDemonstrator program, an Etihad 787-10 tested new technologies to reduce in-flight noise and emissions. In partnership with NASA, the program conducted the most comprehensive aero-acoustic research ever on a commercial airplane.

Boeing also partners with Etihad to test sustainable practices on the Abu Dhabi airline's commercial flights. Last month, Etihad operated its most sustainable flight ever with a 787-10, utilizing learnings and efficiencies developed over the past two years to reduce carbon emissions in absolute terms compared to previous flights. Boeing provided navigation and flight tools to help avoid weather and turbulence, and worked with other industry partners to optimize the departure, arrival and taxi to reduce fuel use throughout the flight.

As a leading global aerospace company, Boeing develops, manufactures and services commercial airplanes, defense products and space systems for customers in more than 150 countries. The company leverages the talents of a global supplier base to advance economic opportunity, sustainability and community impact. Boeing's diverse team is committed to innovating for the future and living the company's core values of safety, quality and integrity. Learn more at www.boeing.com.

Boeing to boost space station power supply with new solar arrays



January 11, 2021 — The International Space Station (ISS) will soon be getting a power boost.



The space station, which has drawn the majority of its electricity from eight large solar panels for the past 15 years, will be augmented with six new solar arrays beginning later this year. The new addition will provide a 20 to 30 percent increase in power, enabling the complex's growing research capabilities and commercial opportunities.



""These arrays ... will ensure that ISS remains an incubator and business model in the commercial space ecosystem for the coming decades,"" John Mulholland, ISS vice president and program manager for Boeing, said in a statement. Boeing will provide the new panels under a $103 million modification to its International Space Station sustainment contract with NASA.



The station's original set of solar arrays wings have been continuously operating since they were deployed by space shuttle crews in December 2000, September 2006, June 2007 and March 2009. The first pair of solar arrays has now provided power for more than two decades — five years more than they were designed to support — as more modules were added, the space station's crew grew in number and activities aboard the orbiting laboratory increased.



The current arrays, though they continue to function well, are showing signs of degradation. The new arrays, which will be positioned in front of six of the current panels, are smaller than the existing solar arrays but are more capable, resulting in an overall increase in performance.



""The XTJ Prime space solar cells are much more efficient than any of their predecessors,"" said Tony Mueller, president of Spectrolab, the Boeing subsidiary that produced both the original and new solar cells for the station. The XTJ Prime solar cells are also the same that will power Boeing's Starliner spacecraft in flight and while docked to the ISS.



The new 63-foot-by-20-foot (19-meter-by-6-meter) arrays will shade slightly over half of the length of the existing arrays and will be connected to the same power system to augment the existing supply.



The eight current arrays are currently capable of generating up to 160 kilowatts of power during orbital daytime, about half of which is stored in batteries for use while the station is in Earth's shadow. Each new array will produce more than 20 kilowatts of electricity, totaling 120 kilowatts (120,000 watts) of augmented power during orbital daytime.



The remaining uncovered area of the original solar arrays will continue to generate approximately 95 kilowatts of power for a combined total of up to 215 kilowatts (215,000 watts) of electricity available to support station operations at completion.



The solar arrays will be delivered to the station in pairs in the unpressurized trunks of SpaceX Dragon cargo spacecraft during three resupply missions beginning as soon as May 2021, several months before the second pair of original arrays reach their 15th year of use on orbit. The installation of each new solar array will require two spacewalks: one to prepare the worksite with a modification kit and another to install the panel.



Deployable Space Systems of Santa Barbara, California, is producing the new solar arrays' structure, including the canister and frame that will unfurl to hold the solar array blankets in place.



Deployable Space Systems also built the canister, frame and solar array blanket for a prototype of the XTJ Prime arrays that was successfully tested three and a half years ago aboard the ISS. The Roll-Out Solar Array (ROSA) experiment demonstrated the mechanical capabilities for the arrays' deployment in June 2017.



The new and original arrays together will provide the needed electricity for NASA to use the space station as a springboard for its Artemis missions to the moon, while opening the space station for business and commercial activities, including private astronauts missions.



""Access to this unique lab will continue to pay off as researchers study the challenges of future deep space exploration and make discoveries that improve life on Earth,"" said Mulholland. ""When it comes to game-changing research and technological development, the space station is currently hitting its full stride.""

In addition, the airframer remains downbeat on the prospects for hydrogen, and also offers a cautious view on the prospects for new engine designs such as open rotor architectures.

Boeing’s newly appointed chief sustainability officer Chris Raymond – speaking during a recent visit to Singapore where he was accompanied by Mike Sinnett, vice-president and general manager of product development for Boeing Commercial Airplanes – said that multiple solutions would be required to drive the decarbonisation of aviation.

“When you talk about sustainable aerospace, what is it going to take to get the industry to net-zero [emissions]?” asks Raymond. “Our view is that it is going to take a portfolio of things.”

In the shorter term, fleet renewal with more fuel-efficient aircraft will play a role. Raymond notes that in a normal year 2-3% of the fleet are replaced by more efficient aircraft but industry shocks tend to raise this number to 5%.

“We’ll probably see a greater amount of deliveries over the next few years go toward a replacement of some of these older airplanes that will get retired,” he says. “And that fleet renewal has a big impact on fuel efficiency and carbon emissions. The best thing the world can do as we recover from the coronavirus pandemic is to see that fleet renewal occur.”

More efficiencies can also be squeezed from operations. He notes that airlines have diligently searched for fuel savings in areas such as single engine taxiing or reduced use of auxiliary power units. Aircraft weight has also been cut aggressively, whether through the installation of lighter seats, the removal of footrests, or loading less water on certain routes.

Future fuel and propulsion technologies will offer a route to lower-carbon future, but Sinnett contends that the industry will trend toward solutions that offer the most efficient energy usage. On this basis, he is sceptical about the feasibility of hydrogen.

In the last year, hydrogen has enjoyed significant publicity touting its potential as a future aircraft fuel, not least its championing by rival Airbus.

Sinnett, however, lists a number of issues. He says that getting the hydrogen to an aircraft can be carbon intensive. And not all hydrogen has a low carbon footprint: for example, while so-called ‘green’ hydrogen is produced via renewable energy, ‘blue’ hydrogen processed from methane has carbon dioxide as a biproduct.

“We believe that the lowest energy demand solution will win in the long run… hydrogen, for example, takes about four times the volume to get the same amount of energy as sustainable jet fuel,” says Sinnett.

“If you’re going to put something up to cruise altitude a couple times a day, then you really want to optimise the weight and the volume efficiency of whatever energy source that you have.”

While Boeing continues to research hydrogen as a fuel source, this technology could take some years to mature. Moreover, such a fundamental change will present major certification challenges.

“We’re not pooh-poohing it, and we’re doing our hydrogen homework,” says Sinnett. “We’ve done a lot of work on hydrogen, but we don’t want to artificially create an expectation that this is the answer when we’re not convinced that it is.”

Boeing sees more immediate potential in SAF. In January, the company stated that by 2030 it will deliver aircraft capable of burning 100% SAF, while it continues to study other carbon-reducing technologies for the longer term.

Currently, airlines can only burn SAF that has been blended with fossil-based fuel, to a maximum of 50%. However, engine manufacturers are working to certificate their powerplants for 100% biofuel use.

Raymond and Sinnett note that while an aircraft today could fly on 100% SAF for its entire lifetime, it cannot feasibily swap between biofuel and Jet A. Or rather, it can make that switch, but only once, as the properties of the different fuel types vary too much, potentially damaging seals and pumps within the fuel system.

In future, airliners will need to switch back and forth between SAF and Jet A, and be able to use various mixes of the two, they point out.

“It really comes down to finding a way to replace some of the materials that absorb aromatics out of the fuel,” says Raymond. “We’re already working with some of the suppliers of those materials to try to figure out what we need.”

Aromatics are compounds found in fuels derived from crude oil, but not present in biofuel.

Sinnett adds that another challenge with SAF, and blends, is the impact on the fuel’s freezing point. Moreover, the density of SAF and Jet A differ: while 1kg (2.2lb) of SAF has better energy density than the same quantity of Jet A, the SAF takes up a greater volume.

“If you need a full tank of fuel to do a mission, you’re not going to get as much energy with sustainable fuel as you would with Jet A, because now you’re talking volume, not mass,” says Sinnett. “And so from a mass perspective, it’s got more energy per kilogram. From a volumetric perspective, it’s got less energy per gallon.”

This volume versus mass dynamic will impact fuel sensing systems, flight management, and flight planning, he says.

CFM International, Boeing’s long-time supplier of narrowbody engines, recently unveiled a new demonstrator programme, RISE, which uses an open rotor architecture and promises a fuel-burn reduction of 20% over current-generation turbofans.

Sinnett says the concept is ”certainly worth studying,” as “specific fuel consumption looks really good on open rotor.”

Nonetheless, he has some reservations about the architecture. An open rotor can be twice the size of conventional turbofan, he says, which generates significantly more airflow across the top of the wing, changing the aerodynamic performance of the structure.

“You may install [an open rotor] on a test stand without a wing behind it, and get one level of performance, but when you put it on an airplane with the wing behind it, now there’s interference between the two, you’ll get a different level of performance,” he says.

Moreover, the fuselage of aircraft powered by an open rotor will require extra protection against fan blade loss, adding weight. Finally, a heavier engine will also require a heavier pylon.

“There’s a lot of those things that by the time we integrate [open rotor] into the airplane, some of its [efficiency] goes away. But I think ultimately it’s still very interesting.”

CFM has said that the RISE demonstrator will be no larger than current narrowbody engines and has solved the weight and noise issues of previous generations of open rotor designs.

Sinnett stresses that engines are just one element of improving an aircraft’s fuel efficiency, noting that structural dynamics, advanced materials, and flight controls also have a significant impact.

Boeing is taking sustainability seriously: the appointment of company veteran Raymond to the newly created post – reporting directly to chief executive Dave Calhoun – is a sign of that commitment.

Internally, Boeing is also working on ways to make its operation greener. Raymond believes it has already laid the foundations for a more sustainable design and development process on future aircraft, highlighted by efforts on the T-7A advanced jet trainer and Boeing Australia’s Airpower Teaming System unmanned air vehicle.

“Both of those airplanes were designed and built differently: much more digital, far less physical assets were built and destroyed. And so just a lot less waste in the process.”

Quite apart from reducing carbon emissions, Raymond says that a focus on sustainability will be key to the sector’s ability to attract younger people to join the industry as it is a key consideration for that demographic.

He is in the process of building a senior team focused on sustainability, with members stationed both in the USA and internationally. Further, the company is putting the final touches on a new and updated sustainability report. This will present a clearer picture of the company’s sustainability initiatives, including information that has not previously been released publicly.

Raymond says that reducing fuel burn has always been a hallmark of aviation, but in an age marked by concerns about the environment, it is increasingly crucial for the industry to highlight its efforts to become greener.",Boeing sees SAF as short-term solution as sustainability drive gathers pace

Due to the ongoing conflict, the U.S. and Europe are threatening economic sanctions on Russia – sanctions that will disrupt Boeing’s supply chain for titanium and therefore, their ability to produce aircraft. Despite the economic consequences of sanctions, the U.S. government aims to prevent violence in Ukraine and they value a peaceful solution over a potential war.

Since December 2021, Russia has demanded a new security arrangement in Europe, one that would allow them to expand their sphere of influence. For example, Russia is asking that Ukraine never be admitted to NATO. The U.S. and Europe are refusing to give in to the demands; in response Russia lined up 100,000 troops at the Ukrainian border. Despite Russia denying any plan to invade, troops are a show of force and foreshadow future military conflict, which the U.S. is trying to prevent.

The White House released a statement by President Biden on Monday January 31st, emphasizing his desire to prevent military conflict in Eastern Europe. “If Russia is sincere about addressing our respective security concerns through dialogue, the United States and our Allies and partners will continue to engage in good faith,” Biden said. “If instead Russia chooses to walk away from diplomacy and attack Ukraine, Russia will bear the responsibility, and it will face swift and severe consequences.”

Biden prefers a diplomatic approach with open dialogue, rather than military action. In hopes of encouraging Russia to pull away their troops, the U.S. is threatening economic sanctions, a nonviolent act. However, Biden’s focus on a peaceful solution may hurt U.S. companies and global supply chains. Boeing is especially concerned about their 25-year-long partnership with VSMPO-AVISMA, a Russian company that supplies U.S. aircraft producers with titanium. Since Boeing is a global aerospace company, if their production is slowed due to supply chain troubles, the globe will feel the effects. Further, Boeing is not the only U.S. company that relies on Russian companies for aircraft supplies; the entire U.S. aircraft industry will be affected negatively if these economic sanctions are put in place.

Luckily, these companies are not yet in complete disaster mode. In 2014, the U.S. sanctioned Russia for annexing Crimea from Ukraine, which disrupted access to metals needed for aircraft. The aircraft industry realized the consequences of relying on one Russian company for supplies, and have since diversified their sourcing. The pandemic also decreased the rates at which aircraft were made, giving companies an opportunity to stockpile titanium supplies. According to Reuters, on Wednesday January 26th, Boeing Chief Executive David Calhoun said that the company is “protected for quite a while, but not forever.”

Until Wednesday February 2nd, there was no military action on behalf of the U.S. or Europe – they maintained a peaceful approach. In the weeks Russian troops were at the border, French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson made diplomatic efforts to arrive at a resolution. Unfortunately, Russia did not budge. According to the New York Times, on Wednesday the U.S. deployed troops to the border in case Russia invades Ukraine. John F. Kirby, the U.S. Pentagon Press Secretary, commented on the deployment, emphasizing its defensive nature with the goal of protecting NATO allies, and reassuring it is not an offensive move.

As tension builds, aircraft companies are growing concerned about their business models. The choice between economy and peace in this situation is tough, something the U.S. is grappling with. If the U.S. sanctions Russia, the supply chain for titanium and other metals will be interrupted, creating a challenging business climate for the aircraft industry. However, the U.S. is thinking long-term towards the prevention of a violent escalation in Ukraine – therefore they are focusing on arriving at a peaceful, non-military solution.",Boeing Says Ukraine Tensions And Potential Economic Sanctions Create An ‘Adverse Climate’ For The Aircraft Industry

Does Boeing’s Next ecoDemonstrator Alter The Aviation Sustainability Picture?

Boeing revealed its latest ecoDemonstrator aircraft on Thursday, June 3. In a briefing with reporters, the American manufacturing behemoth outlined a number of new projects that it plans to test with the aircraft.

Boeing will retrofit an Alaska Airlines Boeing 737-9 with a number of new technologies in order to test how each project performs in the real world on regularly scheduled flights. The aircraft will also help Boeing collect environmental data from airports around the United States to share with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), with whom Boeing is partnering to alter climate modeling and long-term forecasting data.

This new ecoDemonstrator will feature a number of climate-focused tests to study ways for Boeing to make aircraft more efficient. For example, Boeing will study whether it can use recycled carbon fibers recovered from its composite airframe manufacturing in-cabin sidewall panels to make the sidewall, and therefore the aircraft, lighter, making the aircraft more efficient by reducing weight. The planemaker is also conducting ground tests on a new compound called CF3I to replace the Halon 1301 compound, which extinguishes engine fires but has also been found to be incredibly damaging to the ozone.

Boeing will also use the ecoDemonstrator to conduct a number of non-environmental tests to improve overall aircraft comfort and safety. The manufacturer is testing new modified fuel vents that shoot air straight down, creating what Boeing calls “a curtain of air between seat rows” to “further prevent airborne particles from traveling throughout the cabin.” The 737’s right engine will feature a more efficient nacelle to make the engine itself quieter, making the flight more comfortable for passengers and potentially increasing the number of noise-restricted airports Boeing can fly its aircraft into.

Possibly most importantly, though, Boeing says all of its ecoDemonstrator flights will be operated by a blend of traditional and sustainable fuels. All flights will contain roughly 30% of the sustainable jet fuel, which Boeing claims reduces CO2 emissions by 75% throughout the fuel’s life cycle.

Boeing’s Moves Toward Efficiency

Boeing has long been searching for ways to make its aircraft more efficient, making them easier for airlines to operate by reducing costs of fuel. As airlines, governments and intergovernmental agencies alike have increased pressure on airlines and manufacturers to reduce emissions to combat climate change, manufacturers like Boeing have been at the center of the debate on how exactly to reach the International Civil Aviation Organization’s goal of slashing aviation’s emissions by 50% by 2050.

In aviation, making fundamental changes to how airlines do business is never an easy task. Carriers are always weary to accept changes that have not been heavily tested and have not had any track record of success. This goes for just about anything – buying planes from new manufacturers, getting into new markets and overcoming massive market challenges are always risky tasks.

Planemakers like Boeing, therefore, have a big role to play in moving the aviation industry closer to carbon neutrality. This ecoDemonstrator program, which, over 8 planes and 10 years, has tested 195 different projects, is an integral first step in bringing new sustainability measures to market. Not only is Boeing helping collect information for organizations like NOAA, it is also proving to airlines – which have operated six of the eight ecoDemonstrators Boeing has used since 2012 – that its new ideas can work in normal operations.

Boeing also has the advantage of relying on airframes that airlines are already familiar with. From an economic and PR standpoint, it is a much safer bet to, for example, fly a 737 or a 787 Dreamliner modified to be more efficient and running on sustainable fuels than it is to take bets on entirely new concepts with no precursors.

Where Boeing Falls Behind

Yet Boeing’s tests have also been criticized for being notably muted. While it has been able to test a number of different projects and technologies, Boeing has only had eight major ecoDemonstrators including the one announced this week, which means that its technologies, while proven in regular operations, have not proven the longevity airlines often demand before making significant changes to their operations.

Boeing has also only committed to making its planes capable of operating on sustainable fuels by 2030. While these fuels do release fewer greenhouse gasses than their traditional counterparts, they do still release some gasses, and its remarkably inefficient production creates a lot of waste relative to the amount of fuel created.

Meanwhile, Airbus is well ahead of Boeing in creating new zero-emission aircraft. The manufacturer revealed last year its plans to produce three new zero-emission aircraft powered by hydrogen to be released by 2035. While these planes similarly do not have the track record that other planes which have been around for a while – notably which Boeing will modify – they are produced by a well-respected planemaker with a relatively superb safety record, so it is very likely that airlines, especially those close to Airbus, will be willing to take these aircraft for government incentives or to use as marketing tactics for climate-focused fliers.

Boeing is even a bit behind unproven manufacturers. When United Airlines announced its order for new Overture planes produced by Boom Supersonic, it committed to flying the aircraft entirely with sustainable aviation fuels. Deliveries for those planes are set to launch in 2029, years before Boeing is planning on having all of its planes ready to accept the fuels.

It is important to make the distinction that United has for some time been a leader in aviation sustainability. It was the first major airline to commit to being fully carbon neutral – before the ICAO 50% reduction deadline no less – and has lead competitors like FedEx down similar paths.

It still does feel, though, that Boeing is falling behind its competitors. While this new ecoDemonstrator will be running tests for nearly six months – it starts its flights at the end of June and won’t stop until December – Boeing has yet to make any big moves to rival those of Airbus or even the Boom Supersonic/United combo.

The tests Boeing is running this time around don’t hint at any big changes to come, either. While Boeing is rumored to be working on new highly efficient aircraft like the “767-X” and “757 PLUS,” they have not committed to any more substantial long-term goals.",Does Boeing's Next ecoDemonstrator Alter The Aviation Sustainability Picture? – AirlineGeeks.com

SpiceJet, Boeing and CSIR-Indian Institute of Petroleum (IIP) today announced that they are working together to explore opportunities for the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) in the Indian aviation industry, as part of the organizations' commitment to help reduce carbon emissions, contributing to the Indian Government's environmental goals.

The companies will work together to leverage SAF supply from CSIR-IIP and its production partners and licensees to help SpiceJet decarbonize its fleet. SAF can reduce CO2 emissions by as much as 65% over the fuel's life cycle with the potential to reach 100% in the future. It is recognized as offering the most immediate and greatest potential to decarbonize aviation over the next 20 to 30 years.

On August 27, 2018, in its endeavor to go green, SpiceJet operated India's first-ever BioJet Fuel powered flight. The airline successfully undertook the flight on the Dehradun-Delhi route using its Q400 aircraft. SpiceJet was the first Indian airline to explore aerial operations powered by BioJet fuel.

Ajay Singh, Chairman and Managing Director, SpiceJet said, ""We are at the forefront in leading initiatives that contribute to the reduction in carbon footprint, enabling the Indian aviation sector to be smarter, cleaner, and sustainable. This expanded work with Boeing, with whom we already share a strong partnership through the highly efficient 737 MAX, along with the Indian Institute of Petroleum, who are the frontrunners for developing SAF in India, is a step in the journey to ensure air travel is sustainable for future generations.""

""At Boeing, environmental sustainability is at the core of how we work and develop our products and solutions for our customers. We have been pioneers in making sustainable aviation fuels a reality. We believe that strategic partnerships within the Indian aerospace ecosystem are critical to decarbonizing our industry, aligned with the Indian Government's environmental goals. We are honored to work with SpiceJet to advance sustainable aviation, with whom we already have an enduring partnership, and extend gratitude to IIP for being the catalysts for enabling SAF in India, for India,"" said Salil Gupte, President, Boeing India.

""Our Institute is the first and currently the only organization in India that is developing a fully indigenous SAF in the country, for the country. We are delighted to partner with SpiceJet and Boeing to contribute to making the Indian skies cleaner and greener,"" said Dr. Anjan Ray, Director, CSIR-Indian Institute of Petroleum.

Made from several feedstocks, sustainable aviation fuel is certified for commercial use and can be blended with traditional jet fuel without modifications to airplanes, engines, or fueling infrastructure.

In 2021, Boeing committed to deliver its commercial airplanes capable and certified to fly on 100% SAF by 2030. This announcement builds on Boeing's long-term industry leadership and investment to develop SAF around the world, partnering with airlines, fuel companies, governments and research institutions to expand SAF supply and reduce its cost.

In a multi-day exercise that expanded upon a similar activity, RAAF operators worked with the digital twin to develop and test autonomous behaviours in operational scenarios and against threats provided by Defence.

“We are working closely with Boeing Australia on the integration of advanced payloads and operational requirements to ensure the Airpower Teaming System capability will be mission-ready to support air combat operations,” Air Vice-Marshal Robert Denney, RAAF Head of Air Force Capability, said. “The state-of-the-art digital twin concept is allowing us to evaluate and integrate smart human-machine teaming systems in our force structure.”

Testing included validation of the teaming aircraft integration and payloads as they operated alongside Defence crewed platforms, as well as the effectiveness of the distributed sensors across the Airpower Teaming System uncrewed team. The test scenario involved several aircraft operating in a threat environment, executing mission aims in co-ordination with crewed aircraft being operated by RAAF personnel, and builds on work to develop the crewed-uncrewed interface during earlier activities.

This work also contributes to the development of the Boeing Airpower Teaming System being offered to global customers.

“Our digital engineering expertise has enabled us to accelerate the Airpower Teaming System’s product lifecycle development of the aircraft design through to production,” Brad Thompson, Airpower Teaming System Chief Capability Architect, said. “Creating the digital environment has also enabled us to test the mission systems code in a realistic operational environment so we can rapidly iterate our crewed/uncrewed teaming concepts and payload implementation to meet the threat environment.”

“Taking a digital twin approach delivers an agile, cost effective test program to keep pace with the future battlespace, and we’re well along the path to drive towards initial operational capability.”

Progress on the Airpower Teaming System’s mission system and payload development has included ground-based hardware and software in-the-loop testing, followed by surrogate flight testing of the on-board systems to support verification of the digital models.

“We’re excited to test elements of payloads against appropriately spectrally representative targets in field trials,” Thompson said. “This enables us to rapidly roll in lessons learned into our digital environment to accelerate development towards an operational capability.”

A digital twin of the entire aircraft has been ‘flown’ thousands of times under different battlespace effects to test aircraft performance and maximise its deployment capability independently and in support of other aircraft.

The F-15EX recently completed a missile weapons test that involved medium-range air-to-air missiles – just what the Air Force is likely to use in a potential conflict with Russia or China. The war in Russia is showing that beyond-visual-range missile shots from fighters and bombers is a tactic that is becoming more common in 21st-century aerial warfare.

What’s New with the F-15EX

Here is more on some of the latest developments for the F-15EX. This month engineers and testers evaluated how well the F-15EX launched two AMRAAMs – the AIM-120D and AIM-120C3 medium-range air-to-air missiles. The analysts conducted a study at Eglin and Tyndall Air Force Bases in Florida to determine the airplane’s stand-off combat capability. The F-15EX can hold up to 12 AMRAAMs. The weapons evaluation team is excited about this test and is confident pilots will have the munitions they need to fight adversaries.

Put a Stake in the Enemy’s Heart

The engineers also tested the Eagle II’s ability to accomplish radar warning, electronic warfare, and jamming capabilities on board. The sensor system gives pilots a 360-degree picture of the battlespace to increase the level of situational awareness with better survivability. This will allow the airplane the ability to fire stand-off missiles but also go into the heart of contested airspace and fight its way in and out successfully. Not everyone believes combat will be smooth for the F-15EX, but we will get to that discussion from the critics in a moment.

How Many Eagle IIs Will the Air Force Order?

The Air Force plans to order 80 F-15EX fighters, although 19FortyFive has reported the program is having difficulties and may not meet that number or the entire program could even be canceled due to cost overruns. The fourth-generation airplane is a big improvement over the F-15 Eagle base model that first flew in 1976. The Air Force upgraded the original Eagle with the F-15C, which became operational in the 1980s, and later the F-15E Strike Eagle. Throughout its lifecycle, the F-15 has achieved at least 100 victories and no losses in combat.

Pilot-Friendly and Easier to Maintain

The idea is for the F-15EX to enhance the fleet of F-35 Lightning IIs. The F-15C and E pilots can switch over to the F-15EX without missing a beat. The F-15EX has a 28 percent larger payload than the earlier Eagle models. Maintenance will be easier since the majority of parts are the same. Training, hangars, maintenance facilities, and other infrastructure will not require any changes. Plus, the factory assembly lines will remain.

A Future Hypersonic Missile Truck

The F-15EX also has fly-by-wire controls and a better airframe to make the airplane more maneuverable and agile during high-G flight. Another interesting feature will be the F-15EX’s ability to launch hypersonic weapons. The F-15EX will also require less maintenance than other F-15 models. The software for the new airplane has been upgraded, and the ability to change mission parameters efficiently and quickly will be a key feature.

However, not all is rosy in the land of the F-15EX. John Venable, who is the Senior Research Fellow in Defense Policy at the Heritage Foundation, has been critical of the F-15EX program in the past because of its exorbitant costs.

“The Defense Department calculates the F-15EX at $110 million. But that does NOT include the cost for simulators, EPAWSS (Eagle Passive Active Warning and Survivability System), or the targeting and IRST (infrared search and track) pods required for combat. Adding in those costs brings the gross weapons systems cost for the F-15EX to $136.7 million—$38.5 million or 39 percent more than a fully loaded F-35A,” Venable wrote in a Heritage commentary in April.

That’s not all, Venable explained. “It shows the cost to fly an F-15E for a full year is $7.7 million, compared to only $7 million for an F-35A. With the additional requirement to maintain EPAWSS and the IRST pod, the F-15EX will very likely cost more, he wrote.

Venable believes the F-15EX is problematic because of the hidden costs. “In the wake of Putin’s invasion of Ukraine and a rising China, we need to field the best fighter anywhere in numbers that matter, and we need to do it now. The F-35A is much cheaper to buy and fly than the F-15EX—and if you are wondering which jet Air Force pilots prefer, just ask them. I did, and those who transitioned from the F-15E to F-35A—or any other fourth-generation fighter—would never go back. Neither should we.”

Could the Money Go Elsewhere?

The F-15EX is also taking money away from the Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) fighter that will be replacing the F-22 by 2030. Resources for the Air Force are of course scarce. The NGAD may cost several hundreds of millions of dollars each, so any savings from other programs can help the NGAD come to fruition, which will be a necessity to keep pace with stealth fifth- and sixth-generation fighter development from China and Russia.

But Will It Survive?

Aside from the cost, the other concern is the lack of stealthiness and its ability to survive in contested air space. The F-15EX would have to fly in attack mode with sufficient numbers and endure some attrition. It would also need to depend on electronic warfare aircraft to jam and spoof enemy air defense systems. More aircraft leads to higher costs and more personnel in harm’s way. Is the Air Force ready to deal with a fighter getting shot down and a pilot ejecting into the ocean somewhere in the Indo-Pacific?

It’s Not the Time for an “Expensive Target”

That’s why some are describing the F-15EX as an “expensive target.” My inclination on the matter is to give the airplane a chance and see how it performs in several future joint exercises as it did in Alaska for the Northern Edge training event in 2021. Without more evaluation, it is premature to cancel it at this time. But the Department of Defense should do some soul-searching on this airplane. Air Force planners should have given more accurate forecasts of future costs and thought harder about how survivable this fighter will be in a shooting conflict.

(""CEMEX"") announced today that the U.S. Department of Energy awarded US$3.2 million to Solar MEAD, a joint project headed by CEMEX, Sandia National Laboratories, and Synhelion, which aims to decarbonize cement production.

Solar MEAD aims to replace the use of fossil fuels with concentrated solar thermal (“CST”) energy in clinker production, the key component in cement. CEMEX and Synhelion have been collaborating to introduce CST in the cement production process, achieving the first successful laboratory-scale demonstrative pilot in 2022 by producing the first-ever solar clinker. Sandia Laboratories will contribute unique research facilities as part of the National Solar Thermal Test Facility, and subject matter expertise to help accelerate the adaptation of the technology to cement manufacturing.

Synhelion's breakthrough technology delivers high-temperature process heat beyond 1,500 degrees Celsius – sufficient heat to produce clinker without using fossil fuels.

""Cement produced with solar energy is an exciting technology with tremendous potential to reduce the carbon footprint of cement production,"" said Fernando A. González, CEO of CEMEX. ""Achieving our net zero carbon goal by 2050 will require relentless innovation such as this to discover and scale breakthrough technologies.""

""Few renewable technologies are capable of generating heat at the temperatures needed to process raw cement feedstock,"" said Nathan Schroeder, Sandia researcher and principal investigator for the Solar MEAD project. ""This project will advance our understanding of how to use concentrating solar technology to gather and deliver the heat to existing cement production facilities and will have crosscutting relevance to other ore processing industries such as refractory, ceramics, and battery production.""

Gianluca Ambrosetti, CEO and Co-Founder of Synhelion, added: ""The project offers us the opportunity to use our sustainable technology to support the decarbonization of energy-intensive cement clinker production. This solution can have a huge impact on the industry and will help to pave the way towards net-zero. We are proud of contributing to this goal.""

The project will investigate methods to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, lower process temperatures, and increase the efficiency of clinker formation using solar energy. The team will assess the conditions to maximize heat transfer to the raw cement mix.

Successful adoption of this technology in cement manufacturing will not only allow for 100% replacement of fossil fuels but also result in a more efficient and lower-cost carbon capture process when compared to the current state-of-the-art technologies.

Clinker is produced by fusing limestone, clay, and other materials in a rotary kiln at temperatures nearing 1,500°C. Fossil fuels are typically used to heat the kiln and are responsible for approximately 40% of the direct CO 2 emissions of the process. Replacing fossil fuels entirely with solar energy is a game-changer in the industry's efforts to achieve carbon neutrality.

(“CEMEX”) announced today the launch of Regenera, a business that provides circularity solutions, including reception, management, recycling, and coprocessing of waste. Regenera leverages CEMEX’s global footprint and the ability of its production processes to use non-recyclable refuse and industrial byproducts as more sustainable substitutes for fossil fuels and natural raw materials.

Regenera aims to serve a diverse client base which includes industrial, manufacturing, and waste collection companies, NGOs, and governments. Regenera provides sustainable solutions for three major waste streams: municipal and industrial, construction, demolition, and excavation (CDEW), and industrial byproducts. Regenera is present in CEMEX’s four regions: Mexico, the US, Europe the Middle East and Asia, and South-Central America and the Caribbean.

“The building materials industry can be a major contributor to a more circular society, and its role in sustainably disposing of waste and byproducts is key to a greener economy,” said Fernando A. González, CEO of CEMEX. “CEMEX has over 20 years of experience managing and utilizing alternative fuels and raw materials, Regenera is the natural evolution of this experience and an important avenue for revenue generation through sustainable businesses.”

Regenera is actively working on several major projects and partnerships throughout the world:

In Mexico, Renegera, formerly known as Pro Ambiente, has a long track record of helping public and private partners manage several waste streams, processing almost two million tons per year. Regenera is working with the government of Mexico City on its “Zero Waste Plan”, turning the city’s refuse into fuels, thereby reducing the amount sent to landfills. In Queretero, Regenera processes over 80% of the urban solid waste generated in the city.

In Colombia, Regenera has signed an agreement to work with Tetrapak, a leading global food processing and packaging solutions company. Regenera will receive and separate multilayer cartons at its facility and returns those that can be reused or recycled to Tetrapak. Additionally, through its recently launched Circularity Center located in Bogotá, Regenera collected over 1.5 million cubic meters of CDEW for the generation of recycled aggregates.

In France, Regenera operates a multiservice dock located in an industrial harbor in Paris offering a wide range of circular economy services to the construction industry. The company receives a variety of materials, including construction debris, excavated material and inert soil, which it sorts, processes, and transforms into recycled aggregates or organic material used to restore quarries.

In Egypt, Regenera has signed a three-year agreement with the NGO Very Nile to support waste removal efforts from the Nile River. The recovered non-recyclable materials will be used to substitute fossil fuels at CEMEX’s Assiut cement plant.

Regenera is part of CEMEX’s growing Urbanization Solutions business. Urbanization Solutions have been a highlight of CEMEX’s recent performance. In its third quarter 2022 report, the CEMEX announced double-digit growth in both sales and EBITDA for this business.

CEMEX and partners iconsys and University of Warwick have been awarded funding from the Department of Transport for the development of a shore power system to eliminate the operation of on-board diesel engines while its ships are discharging marine aggregates.

CEMEX

CEMEX’s participation demonstrates its commitment to fostering partnerships with forward-thinking organisations as part of its efforts to achieve true carbon neutrality, in line with the Future in Action program, the company said in the release.

The project will investigate the feasibility of developing a shore power energy delivery system incorporating battery energy storage, capable of meeting the electrical load requirements of self-discharging commercial cargo vessels; utilising energy derived from carbon free sources.

The study will focus on a solution for the CEMEX Go Innovation, which is already the industry’s most modern and efficient aggregates dredger.

Laurence Dagley, Operational Excellence and Business Development Director for CEMEX West Europe materials commented: “Our commitment to sustainability means we are examining every aspect of our operation to cut emissions, including in our marine business. We are very proud to have received this funding from the UK Government for the project, which will also explore the whole-ship energy efficiency, design, and integration to identify areas where systems can be improved, replaced, or removed to reduce the energy requirements. Additionally, this project could help our vessels meet potential forthcoming ’emissions at berth’ regulation while contributing to the UK Government’s Clean Maritime objectives.”

Phil Alston, commercial director at iconsys said: “We’re delighted to have been awarded funding for this project and to be working alongside CEMEX and University of Warwick to further develop shore power technology. It helps to further validate iConvert™ as a world-leading product for shore power.”

Andrew McGordon, Reader at WMG, University of Warwick, commented “We’re excited to have been awarded funding for this project, alongside iconsys and CEMEX, to further develop our innovative marine systems energy modelling work to help identify energy reductions, emission and cost benefits in the sector.”

The Department of Transport has agreed this funding as part of the clean maritime demonstration competition (CMDC), which will help innovative companies and scientists make emission-free maritime a reality.",CEMEX committed to sustainability

(“CEMEX”) announced today that it is reaffirming its commitment to the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly those focused on climate action; sustainable cities and communities; responsible consumption and production; and industry, innovation, and infrastructure.

CEMEX’s CEO, Fernando A. González, participated in a CEO roundtable hosted by UN Secretary-General António Guterres at the UN’s New York City headquarters on Monday, Sept. 19. The roundtable included 11 CEOs representing companies from around the globe and focused on proposals for strengthening the private sector’s commitment to the SDGs.

“CEMEX’s core purpose is to build a better, more sustainable, future,” said Fernando A. González. “We recently agreed to strengthen our partnership with the UN on topics aligned with our strategy and areas of expertise including sustainable finance, supply chain, diversity and inclusion, and a just transition to a carbon neutral economy. Moreover, through our flagship decarbonization program, Future in Action, we seek to lead the way in climate action for the building materials industry.”

In 2022, for the second consecutive year, the world achieved little progress towards the SDG 2030 targets. The roundtable united leaders from companies that are strongly contributing to the UN Global Compact (UNGC) to discuss how to inspire ambitious and principled business leadership committed to achieving the SDGs. The UNGC is the world’s largest corporate sustainability initiative, and an ideal platform for the private sector to align its strategies and operations to the SDGs.

Recent contributions to the SDGs by CEMEX include the launch of Vertua, its lower-carbon and net-zero CO 2 family of products; agreements to clean beaches and waterways, including the Nile River, and use the recovered waste as an alternative fuel in its operations; a new concrete 3D printing construction solution with the potential to reduce housing costs; and the transition of several cement plants to renewable electricity.

CEMEX was also present at the SDG Investment Forum organized by the UNGC’s CFO Coalition. At the event, CEMEX’s CFO, Maher Al-Haffar, spoke about CEMEX’s decarbonization pathway, the experience of aligning its investments to the SDGs, and the innovations required to deliver only net-zero concrete by 2050. Earlier this year CEMEX published its Green Financing Framework, which together with its Sustainability-Linked Framework align its corporate finance strategy to its sustainability commitments and support the financing of SDG-aligned investments in areas such as CO 2 emissions reduction, clean electricity, energy efficiency, clean transportation, water management, air quality, circular economy, and waste management.

The agreement supports end-to-end plastic waste reduction processes, starting from plastic waste collection, consolidation, aggregation, treatment, and concluding in co-processing, preventing them from ending up in landfills, bodies of water, or the environment.

“We are very pleased to enter into this agreement which demonstrates our pivotal role in a circular economy, further strengthening our track towards carbon neutrality by 2050,” said Luis Franco, President and CEO of CEMEX Philippines.

“PCX is proud to be a part of this important agreement in support of our mission to end plastic waste entering nature,” said Sebastian DiGrande, CEO of PCX. “This partnership enables the responsible disposal of end-of-life plastics that have no other channels for recycling and provides a valuable bridge in the transition to a truly circular economy for plastics,” Sebastian added.

World Bank reports that by 2050, global waste generation is expected to grow to 3.4 billion tons per year, or a 70% increase compared to 2016. This increase consequently increases greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions since they are linked to global waste generation. Specific to plastics, reports show that the world’s production of plastic waste is twice as much as two decades ago, with most of it ending up in landfills or bodies of water, and only about 9% are effectively recycled. Decomposition in landfills produces methane gas, a greenhouse gas that is 25 times as potent as carbon dioxide at trapping heat in the atmosphere.

“Due to the large volume of plastics generated everywhere, CEMEX’s co-processing solution using plastic waste as alternative fuels undoubtedly helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions, lessening dependence on fossil fuels,” Franco highlighted.

“No single company can address the huge challenge of plastic waste. Companies need to work together, such as what we have with PCX and CEMEX, to increase the chances of creating a sustainable and better planet,” said Greencycle General Manager Roland Vera Cruz.

Under the agreement, PCX, which owns and operates the Plastic Credit Exchange, will facilitate the certification, sale, and purchase of plastic credits to sustainability-conscious businesses to responsibly offset their plastic footprint and reduce plastic flow into nature. Greencycle, on the other hand, will deliver and supply pre-treated post-consumer plastic waste to CEMEX Philippines’ Solid Cement plant in Antipolo City as Refuse-Derived Fuels (RDF). This waste will be co-processed by Solid Cement as an alternative fuel and/or as a part component in its primary business of manufacturing and production of cement.

Co-processing is a proven sustainable waste disposal solution in which segregated plastics are processed at extremely high temperatures to break materials down into simpler compounds. The non-recyclable wastes, such as plastics, are then converted into usable heat to help in cement production, lessening operational dependency on fuel and electricity use and effectively contributing to a decrease in carbon emissions. The process is monitored in compliance with the standards set by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR).

01 March 2023

The CEMEX and VeryNile initiative have expanded the scope of the partnership to reach the CEMEX Egypt's hometown of Assiut. This comes after the success achieved by their partnership in cleaning the Nile River from plastic waste in Cairo and Giza governorates.



The expansion process included contracting a group from the local fishing community from Assiut who collected four loaded trucks of plastic waste from the Nile during their first month. Following the waste hierarchy, CEMEX will use the non-recyclable, non-hazardous fraction of the waste collected as alternative fuel in its kilns in efforts to reach zero waste to landfills.

The initiative and its expansion come as part of CEMEX efforts to support circular economy as part of its global business for providing circularity solutions, ""Regenera"" – including the receiving, managing, recycling and recovering of waste. Regenera supports the ambition to use more non-recyclable waste and industrial by-products as a more sustainable alternative to fossil fuels and natural raw materials.

CEMEX and VeryNile signed a cooperation protocol in June of last year, to expand the scope of the initiative’s operations in collecting waste from the Nile and support the fishing community of Qursaya Island. Since then, CEMEX has received around 40t of waste collected from the Nile that was used as alternative fuel as part of the company's actions to support circular economy.

“At CEMEX, we work on building a more sustainable future in line with our climate-action programme “Future in Action”. Since we started working with VeryNile, we wanted to expand the initiative to Assiut, and we are delighted to see the initiative taking off in our second year of cooperation”, commented Carlos Gonzalez, CEMEX Egypt and UAE president.

The partnership aims to expand solid waste collection operations in the river, whose resources are needed especially by the fishing community of Qursaya Island in the Cairo metropolitan area.

“We will co-treat the waste that is dumped to contribute to the ‘zero waste in landfills’ challenge, with a view to protecting the Nile from behaviours that lead to its pollution,” says Fernando Gonzales, Cemex’s CEO. The company, based in San Pedro Garza García, Mexico, is mainly active in the cement, concrete and aggregates sector in Egypt.

According to Khaled El-Farra, Director of the Environment and Sustainable Development Department of the Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, this partnership will last for three years and will allow the collection of approximately 20 tons of waste per month. In addition to financial support, Cemex will strengthen the equipment used for waste collection and contribute to the promotion of the circular economy in the Cairo governorate.

Ridding the Nile of solid waste

The second longest river in the world after the Amazon (6,692 km) in South America, the Nile is polluted by sewage, waste, and pesticides used for agriculture, especially in its delta. According to the Egyptian Ministry of the Environment, the Nile is also the outlet for 549 million m3 of liquid industrial waste every year. The chemicals and heavy metals it contains come directly from the 345 industrial complexes located along the Nile between Aswan and Cairo.

In this context, VeryNile is setting up a sustainable ecosystem to recycle plastic and other fishermen’s waste collected from the river. The initiative was launched in 2018 by start-ups Bassita, which specialises in cyber awareness and fundraising for positive initiatives, and Greenish which designs and implements sustainable environmental solutions.

The platform also raises awareness against the use of single-use plastic. “VeryNile was created with a strong commitment to preserve the Nile by removing plastics and harmful waste from the river while empowering local communities,” says Alban de Menonville, founder of VeryNile based in the Egyptian city of Giza.

These partnerships and summit engagements are part of the company’s commitment to strengthening multi-sectoral collaboration in order to build a better environment and address climate change. Towards this end, CEMEX Philippines recognized five towns for their contribution to a more circular economy.

The towns of Paete, Siniloan, Kalayaan, Sta. Cruz, and Pila in Laguna received special recognition from CEMEX Philippines, acknowledging their residual plastic waste footprint reduction through co-processing. The awarding was held during the meeting of the Association of Laguna Environment and Natural Resources Officers and Advocates Inc. (ALENROA Inc.) in Cabuyao City. More than 300,000 kilograms of qualified solid wastes from the said municipalities were already co-processed into alternative fuels.

“We want to build the capacity of our local government units in terms of waste management. An efficient waste management solution involves the whole-of-society approach. Businesses and local governments can co-process their solid waste with us to create a positive impact on communities and the environment,” said CEMEX Philippines’ Atty. Christer Gaudiano, ERM, Communications and Public Affairs Director.

Partners of CEMEX have expressed the positive impact of the waste management initiative in their respective localities.

“Malaki talaga ang tulong ng CEMEX kasi 2016 pa partner na kami ni CEMEX. Malaki talaga yung reduction. Of course, na-meet naming yung goal ng waste diversion ng DENR,” said Engr. Maria Lourdes San Miguel, MENRO designate and GSO of Sta. Cruz, Laguna.

(CEMEX is really helping us a lot because we have been a partner of CEMEX since 2016. It’s a really big help in terms of (waste) reduction. Of course, we were able to meet our waste diversion goal’ said Engr. Maria Lourdes San Miguel, MENRO designate and GSO of Sta. Cruz, Laguna.)

“Ito ay isang malaking tulong para sa aming pamahalaang bayan dahil sa halip na itapon pa ito sa disposal shed, ngayon naiipon namin at nadadala namin sa CEMEX, at nakakatulong kami sa pamamagitan ng alternative technology na ipinagkaloob sa amin ng CEMEX,” added Ms. Reynesiba Corpuz, NDRRMO designated member.

(‘This is really a big help for our municipal government because instead of dumping wastes to our disposal shed, we are able to collect and bring them to CEMEX, and we are able to help in the alternative technology given to us by CEMEX, added Ms. Reynesiba Corpuz, NDRRMO designated member.)

Additionally, during the EMB Region 4B Environmental Summit 2022 organized by the Environmental Management Bureau (DENR-EMB-Mimaropa), CEMEX Philippines showcased its best practices in initiating the green movement towards responsible consumption and waste diversion. The two-day forum provided a platform for local government units in the MIMAROPA region to discuss relevant topics on improving environmental quality, particularly ecological solid waste management.

Meanwhile in Cebu, CEMEX Philippines participated in the Clean Air Exhibit as part of the Clean Air Month culmination activity of the Environmental Management Bureau – Region 7 (DENR-EMB-7). The CEMEX booth highlighted air quality management, climate action strategies such as carbon footprint reduction and climate change mitigation, and the company’s contributions and best practices in environmental protection. This includes the company’s co-processing technology, which is an environmental process that involves turning qualified solid waste into alternative fuels, reducing greenhouse gas emissions by replacing fossil fuels.

“This exhibit is a way for the company to enhance public awareness about our environmental actions and best practices for maintaining the air quality standards in the area where we operate,” said Jenevy Patalingjug, Environmental Manager, APO Cement. “We want to share to the public how we protect the environment, care for our employees and upbuild our communities,” Patalingjug added.

All of these efforts are part of CEMEX’s “Future in Action” strategy which aims for the company to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 35 percent by 2025 and 40 percent by 2030, with the ultimate goal of becoming a net-zero CO2 company by 2050.

CEMEX Germany have installed photovoltaic panels at their ready-mixed concrete plant in Velten, north of Berlin. Commissioning of the installation took place at the end of October, with further similar investments set to be announced across the country, in line with the company’s climate goals and Future in Action strategy.

Nearly 65 sq m of photovoltaic panels with a capacity of 13kWh have been installed on the roof of the Velten plant. It is estimated that the panels will meet around 10% of the plant’s annual electricity requirement.

CEMEX Germany have been promoting sustainable solar energy for a long time and say this latest investment is yet another illustration of the company’s commitment to its Future in Action decarbonization strategy.

Other examples include CEMEX Germany’s gravel works in Hohenmin, north of Neubrandenburg, and Sophienhof, near Neustrelitz, both of which feature photovoltaic farms.

Also, since October 2022, CEMEX Kies & Splitt GmbH have been generating sustainable solar power using a 750kWh capacity floating photovoltaic system on their gravel lake in Immelborn, with additional floating systems planned for gravel works at Parey and Rogätz.

Moreover, the company has developed a model to assess the efficiency of photovoltaic installations, taking into account the location and technical conditions of individual plants.

‘CEMEX are actively addressing the climate challenge,’ said Ruediger Kuhn, vice-president of Materials Central Europe at CEMEX and chairman of the board of CEMEX Germany. ‘The key to realizing ambitious intentions is the search for more sustainable technologies, construction solutions, and the implementation of new, lower-emission products.

‘Photovoltaic technology is another investment by CEMEX in Germany in renewable energy sources and fits into CEMEX’s global Future in Action strategy, which aims, among other things, to offer customers worldwide exclusively CO2-neutral concrete from 2050.’",CEMEX Germany promote sustainable solar energy

It will require so many changes in how we have done these things so far, that we can barely imagine such a different world today.

One example is cement production, which, made the way that it’s been made so far with fossil fuels, generates 8% of global CO2 emissions. But two firms have been working on a way to make cement for a future without carbon emissions.

The “hot solar” startup Synhelion is creating alternatives to fossil fuels in both solar fuels and direct industrial heat with the solar technology in which mirrors (heliostats) concentrate and reflect the sun’s rays up to a solar receiver to generate heat. Synhelion has achieved the highest temperature possible today in this solar technology; 1500°C.

A year ago we covered initial work being done on decarbonizing cement processes in a partnership between Synhelion and the international cement producer CEMEX headquartered in Mexico.

Now Synhelion and CEMEX engineers have built a pilot plant, on the Very High Concentration Solar Tower of IMDEA Energy in Spain to produce zero CO2 cement, by substituting direct solar heat for fossil fired heat in one of the world’s most carbon-intensive industries.

That collaboration has now borne its first fruit. Synhelion and CEMEX have produced the first solar clinker in the world.

For this application, in cement production, the solar heat will be piped to a long kiln in the cement factory where the calcination and clinkerization is performed.

Calcination requires heat at about 1000°C for several minutes. Initially the plan was to supply heat just for this calcination process entirely from solar energy, while also siphoning off the natural CO2 emissions which happen due to the chemical reaction, for a 100% emissions-free calcination process.

In the demo the team have gone even further than they initially planned

“We didn’t stop our system at calcination,” explained Dr. Gianluca Ambrosetti, CEO and Co-Founder of Synhelion. “We went further to higher temperatures and performed even the clinkerization, which happens at around 1400 to 1450 degrees.”

This second step; clinkerization is much more of a challenge for solar heat. Not only is the heat requirement greater, but the residence time is longer, up to 30 minutes for each cohort of material rotating through the almost 90 meters-long kiln, and it is operating continuously.

Once the lumps of clinker are produced, they are then combined with gypsum and sent to a grinding mill to become the finished product – powdered cement.

About 95% of the CO2 emissions in cement production come from these two steps, the calcination and the clinkerization. Only about 5% comes from powering the grinding process, which uses electricity.

This is a major breakthrough for solar heat, building on research from the SolPART project that CEMEX was involved in. At the time, Gilles Flamant, who directs the lab testing solar reactors at CNRS-PROMES, cautioned that the most difficult aspect of substituting solar heat for cement making is this duration. “My feeling is that the problem of residence time is actually the critical issue in this, not the heat requirement,” he explained.

“What we achieved is a real milestone in the sense that we managed to go beyond – to also do the clinkerization,” added Davide Zampini, CEMEX Head of Global R&D. “What Synhelion is doing, to be able to reach the 1500 degrees, is essential for us because now we can go beyond calcination. This is a key element. It allows us to completely eliminate fossil fuels from the production of clinker in cement.”

Using the traditional fossil fuel method, the calcination step generates CO2 in two ways. About 60% is from the chemical reaction itself, and 40% is from burning fossil fuel to heat the reaction.

How the solar process eliminates both sources of cement emissions

For this solar process, the heat is not from fossil fuel combustion like traditional cement production, but from sunlight reflected from a solar field of mirrors that concentrates highly focused solar flux up to a receiver on a tower.

Then the heat this creates is carried in a heat transfer fluid, piped down to the kiln in a stream of very high temperature water vapor and CO2.

Because this heat transfer fluid is in a closed loop with no air, it is easy to separate out and siphon off the CO2 from the calcination chemical reaction in a pure stream, by condensing out the water which leaves just CO2 behind.

By contrast, when a fossil fuel is burned in air, it is expensive to capture the emissions because the CO2 is very diluted in the predominantly nitrogen mix of air. This costliness of capturing CO2 in air is why it is not being done, despite political incentives.

“This is an important part of the project, to capture that CO2,” Zampini noted. “Thanks to the fact that it’s a slightly different process because we are using solar heat instead of combustion, capturing the CO2 becomes easy. This is a huge benefit for us as a cement manufacturer. We don’t emit any CO2 into the atmosphere with this process.”

To make the heat transfer fluid onsite, Synhelion would siphon off the carbon dioxide emitted by limestone naturally during the calcination step and use some of it mixed with water vapor. It would keep the remaining CO2 it captured for use by its core business of manufacturing solar fuels from H2O and CO2.

“That’s why this is really elegant,” said Zampini. “Besides CEMEX being the first to produce a solar clinker, Synhelion was born as a company that produces solar synfuels, so it also has a use for the CO2 to make its jet fuels.”

One thing the teams were looking to make sure of was that the solar process would not alter any chemical reactions in cement processes. The testing proved that this was successful.

Next step

“So far, what we have done was a batch process, we didn’t have a continuous process. We produced a few kilograms of clinker,” said Ambrosetti. “We now develop this system further to have kilns that can produce clinker in a continuous fashion. Performing the process continuously is the goal that we want to achieve this year.”

At scale, Ambrosetti said the solar field for a cement plant making ten tons a day of cement would be about the size of today’s tower Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) plants, in the range of several hundred thousand square meters of heliostat area. Remarkably, Synhelion achieves its much higher temperatures from the same size solar field as a conventional tower CSP plant producing heat at a much lower 565°C.

“This comes from our novel receiver design,” Ambrosetti explained. “We can achieve 1,500°C at fairly low concentration, at around a thousand suns, one megawatt per square meter. For a 1,000 tons of clinker per day setup, we would need about 150 megawatts thermal solar input to the receiver. So, this would be around 300,000 square meters of heliostats.”

Ambrosetti noted that Synhelion has already solved the materials issues with operation at such high temperatures. “These high temperatures do create some constraints on material but with our design of receiver, basically a refractory lined cavity, we can use standard materials from the refractory industry and the ones used in a kiln.”

At scale, to maintain the supplied heat continuously, this system would include thermal energy storage like in a solar thermal energy plant. In the next step, incorporating storage, CEMEX and Synhelion will produce clinker in larger quantities to reach industrial scale.",CEMEX and Synhelion ace the First “Hot Solar” Cement Trial

The City of Tayabas and the towns of Atimonan, Candelaria, Mauban, Mulanay and Tiaong received special recognition from CEMEX Philippines, in acknowledgment of their residual plastic wastes footprint reduction through co-processing. The awarding was held during the meeting of the Quezon Province Solid Waste Management Board and the Province’s League of Local Environment and Natural Resources Officers in Tayabas City, Quezon.

The six localities in Quezon have been helping CEMEX Philippines address the country’s waste management problem through proper waste segregation, collection, treatment and co-processing. Since 2021, more than 360,000 kgs of residual waste have been collected from the Province, and CEMEX expects to gather more with additional potential partner LGUs in the Province.

CEMEX Philippines continues to strengthen multisectoral partnerships and aims to add more to the growing list of LGUs in the achievement of plastic neutrality, carbon footprint reduction and contribute to a more circular economy.

“We have been a partner of CEMEX for almost three years already and CEMEX has been a big help to our municipality as it brought us a lot of savings in our solid waste management,” shares Joelda Tadeja, Municipal Environment Officer of Mulanay, Quezon and President of Quezon Province’s League of Local Environment and Natural Resources Officers.

Through a memorandum of understanding, CEMEX and these cities and municipalities in the Province of Quezon are working together towards proper segregation, collection of qualified residual plastic wastes generated from their respective areas, which are transported to CEMEX’s Solid Cement Plant in Antipolo City for treatment and co-processing. Supported by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), co-processing is a proven sustainable way of disposing plastic waste by diverting and utilizing them during the cement manufacturing process.

“Ever since we had a partnership with CEMEX, segregation has been really implemented and the diversion of our residual plastic wastes allowed us to extend the life of our sanitary landfill. Because of our partnership, a lot of people were encouraged to segregate and our LGU implemented more programs about waste management,” says Ryan B. De Luna, Municipal Environment Officer of Candelaria, Quezon.

The Philippines is one of the largest plastic waste contributors in the world. A 2021 World Bank study estimates that over 163 million pieces of sachets are consumed every day and 2.7 million tons of plastic waste are generated in the Philippines each year, around 20 percent of which ends up in the ocean.

“Indeed, plastic waste management is one of our biggest challenges in the country, and we must act together to address this problem” says Atty. Christer Gaudiano, Director for ERM, Corporate Communications & Public Affairs at CEMEX Philippines.

“We are proud with our long and steady partnerships in Quezon Province, and we are happy that we are able to support various local governments in the country to address plastic waste management. Through innovative means, we can divert residual plastic wastes and integrate them into our cement manufacturing operations as alternative energy sources,” Atty. Gaudiano adds.

To date, a total of 25 LGUs are already co-processing their residual wastes with CEMEX, and over two dozen partners are in the pipeline as more LGUs realize the benefits of co-processing and how it helps them regulate and manage waste in their respective cities or municipalities.

These sustainability efforts are all aligned with CEMEX’s Future in Action agenda, the company’s global strategy to help mitigate the impact of climate change by reducing CO2 emissions by 35% by 2025 and by more than 40% by 2030, with the ultimate goal of becoming a net-zero CO2 company by 2050.

With the growing problem of waste disposal in the country, leading cement manufacturer CEMEX Philippines highlighted its sustainable waste management solution, through an industrial process called ‘co-processing’ at a Regional Solid Waste Management summit organized by the Environmental Management Bureau (EMB) Region VII of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR).

“Co-processing is one of our climate-smart solutions that we employ in our operations. It is an effective means to divert plastic and other residual wastes away from municipal landfills and integrate them efficiently into our cement-manufacturing process, resulting to complete breakdown of waste and toxic substances,” explains Atty. Christer Gaudiano, CEMEX Director for Enterprise Risk Management, Corporate Communications and Public Affairs.

Currently, CEMEX has at least 30 local government unit partners across the country to co-process a portion of their municipal wastes, which are transported to CEMEX plants, such as the Solid Cement Plant in Antipolo, Rizal and the APO Cement Plant in Naga, Cebu.

From January to July 2022, CEMEX facilities have already co-processed solid wastes equivalent to 27 days’ worth of waste in Metro Cebu.

CEMEX recognizes the importance of a multi-sectoral approach in solving the country’s problem on waste management and plans to expand its waste management partnerships to more LGUs and even the private sector to broaden this cause.

CEMEX’s climate-smart actions are in line with its Future in Action agenda, a global strategy which focuses on reducing CO2 emissions by more than 40% by 2030 and with the ultimate goal of becoming a net-zero CO2 company by 2050.

Cemex is therefore partnering with VeryNile’s project for the collection and recycling of solid waste around the western bank of the Nile in Assiut.

This governorate, with a population of 4.2 million, is made up of the towns of Assiut, Abnub, Abou Tig, Daïrout, El Badari and Manfalout, where industrial activities contribute to the pollution of the 6,671-kilometre-long river. In a context marked by water stress and illegal fishing in Egypt, the eco-responsible initiative of VeryNile and Cemex’s Egyptian subsidiary should enable the development of the circular economy through sustainable waste management.

“Just like our first Nile clean-up operation (in July 2022) in the governorates of Cairo and Giza, we will use the non-recyclable and non-hazardous fraction of the waste collected from our kilns to achieve carbon neutrality in landfills. This is an alternative to fossil fuels and natural raw materials,” explains Fernando Gonzalez, Cemex’s president for the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Egypt.

At the same time, the authorities in the North African country have begun construction of 31 recycling plants, including a “solid waste management complex” in the 10 Ramadan industrial zone near Cairo, as well as a controlled landfill that will facilitate the sorting and recovery of household waste in the governorate of Qalyubiya. These facilities, eight of which will be delivered by June 2023, will help reduce urban waste pollution.

MEXICO CITY, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Mexican cement maker Cemex said on Wednesday it had achieved the first step in fully powering plants with solar energy, producing what is known as clinker via the sun's rays.

Cemex said in a statement it had teamed up with Swiss solar company Synhelion to produce clinker, a limestone and clay mix used to make cement, with ""record-breaking"" solar heat.

The move to produce clinker via solar heat is part of Cemex's push to go carbon neutral by 2050, as current clinker production uses fossil fuels to heat limestone and clay.

""Cemex is building a better future, and that future must be sustainable,"" Cemex Chief Executive Fernando Gonzalez said in the statement.

The two companies say the pilot was the first time clinker was made through solar energy, though scientists have been toying with the idea since the early 2000s. Now, Cemex and Synhelion hope to bring the project to an industrial scale.

Cemex has previously said it is also exploring clinker alternatives, like burnt shale oil or glass furnace slag. read more

Cemex and other cement makers have felt pressure in recent years from regulators and investors to reduce CO2 emissions. Cement, a key ingredient in concrete, contributes to about 8% of global CO2 emissions, according to one think tank.

However, the companies have said they are up against a number of factors, such as lack of technology, restrictive code enforcement and pressure to keep costs low.

In the United States, which accounts for around 22% of Cemex's sales, building codes leave little room for climate-friendly concrete, Cemex officials have said.

Cemex officials told Reuters last year it would meet its climate goals by using renewable energy and alternative fuels.

MANILA, Philippines — Cemex Philippines seeks to be a net-zero CO2 company by 2050.

This goal is embodied in its “Future in Action” campaign, a global strategy which focuses on reducing CO2 emissions by 35 percent by 2025 and around 40 percent by 2030.

As part of the campaign, Cemex has expanded its portfolio with the introduction of Vertua, a new low carbon and eco-friendly product line.

Vertua-branded products such as the Apo and Rizal Portland High Strength Blended Cement Type IP bear the Vertua Plus seal, signifying that these have corresponding classifications indicating the amount of CO2 reduced in their production, Cemex said.

These products are suitable for green and resilient megastructures given their strength, durability, and lower emissions, Cemex said.

CEMEX is a global construction materials company with a presence in the Philippines. It has consistently been trumpeting its carbon neutrality efforts through the introduction of new products and improvements in processes.

This acquisition is part of CEMEX's Future in Action programme, aimed at achieving carbon neutrality.

“With this acquisition, at CEMEX, we are firmly committed to the circular economy by integrating our value chain to the production of climate-friendly fuels that we use in cement production. Our objective for this year is to double Broquer’s capacity and thereby contribute to the progress towards sustainability in the city of Queretaro, as well as the transformation of Mexico towards a green economy,” said Ricardo Naya, President of CEMEX Mexico.

All waste processed at the Broquers plant will be used as a climate-friendly fuel to power CEMEX's operations in Mexico; CEMEX takes advantage of the energy generated from the processed waste to use in its plants. Thanks to this process, CO 2 emissions into the atmosphere are reduced by replacing fossil fuels, one of the most significant contributors to global warming.

Last year, CEMEX harnessed the energy of more than 500 000 tons of waste to power its operations in Mexico, avoiding the emission of more than 730 000 tons of CO 2 per year or the equivalent of planting 12 million trees. Broquers expects to increase the current staff by 50 new employees this year to expand its processing capacity.

Broquers was the first plant of its kind in Mexico to have sophisticated waste separation equipment in line with European standards for waste treatment. This results in a fast, highly efficient, and safe industrial process that solves the challenge of Queretaro’s municipal waste in a local, sustainable, and environmentally friendly way.

Broquers will continue to operate ordinarily and comply, as before, with all the conditions stipulated in its concession title for the treatment of urban solid waste in the municipality of Queretaro.

The ReadyBlock Zero is a zero-carbon equivalent to the conventional construction material, which is characterised in accordance with The CarbonNeutral Protocol. The product is part of the company’s VERTUSA line of Urbanisation Solutions that are expected to be more sustainable than conventional concrete.



While the product may look like an ordinary block, it holds 80% less embodied carbon and reaches net zero through 20% carbon offsets. The company works with Natural Capital Partners, a London-based organisation that specialises in carbon neutrality and financial services.

Why add zero-carbon concrete to its range?

Similar to other industries, the construction sector is undergoing rigorous legislative changes to ensure that building standards are sustainable in terms of their waste management and contribution to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.



The industry foresees changes to laws to include one that will govern the level of embodied carbon and emissions — the government’s Future Home Standard —, which will ensure that new homes will produce low to no carbon emissions and the target is set to a 75 to 80% reduction by 2025. By June 2022, new home builders are expected to reduce CO2 by around 30% and CEMEX’s low-carbon block is a catalyst in achieving that.



‘We have developed the UK’s first CarbonNeutral® concrete block to help housebuilders get ahead of the game when it comes to building low carbon homes that meet and exceed Government guidelines and changes to building regulations’, says Carl Platt, Urbanisation Solutions Director of Asphalt, Paving and Building Products for Europe. ‘We want to make life easier for housebuilders to make simple sustainable choices that make largescale impacts on the often complex road to net zero. Concrete blocks are the most common structural component in the construction of UK homes, so by switching to zero carbon blocks, ReadyBlock Zero presents a huge opportunity for housebuilders to make significant carbon reductions’.

Sustainability inspired acquisition for waste management

On the 27th of January, it was also announced that CEMEX has acquired a sustainable company to take care of its waste management actions. Broquers Ambiental will focus on the separation, recovery and treatment of waste generated by urban construction projects in the city of Querétaro, Mexico.



The waste produced by the Broquers plant will be put back into operations in Mexico in the form of climate-friendly fuel. This process allows CEMEX to replace fossil fuels with a more sustainably-sourced product. In 2021, the company utilised more than 500,000 tonnes-worth of waste to power Mexican operations, which is equivalent to more than 730,000 tonnes of annual CO2 equivalent that would be achieved by planting 12 million trees.

Cemex says the clinker, which is a key component of cement, is the first in the world produced by solar.

According to Cemex, clinker is produced by fusing limestone, clay and other materials in a rotary kiln at temperatures around 2,700 degrees. Fossil fuels are typically used to heat the kiln, with Cemex saying they are responsible for about 40 percent of the process’s direct carbon dioxide emissions.

“The production of the first solar clinker is an exciting milestone for this transformational technology,” says Fernando Gonzalez, CEO of Cemex. “It is proof of our commitment to deliver tangible outcomes through innovation to achieve our goal of delivering only net-zero CO2 concrete by 2050.”

The project

The Cemex and Synhelion R&D teams set up a pilot batch production unit to produce clinker from concentrated solar radiation by connecting the clinker production process with the Synhelion solar receiver, according to Cemex. The pilot was installed at the Very High Concentration Solar Tower of IMDEA Energy in Spain.

Synhelion’s solar receiver delivers the extreme temperatures. The solar receiver heats a gaseous heat transfer fluid and, thus, provides the necessary process heat for clinker production.

“Our technology converts concentrated sunlight into the hottest existing solar process heat – beyond 1,500 degrees [Celsius] – on the market,” says Gianluca Ambrosetti, CEO and co-founder of Synhelion. “We are proud to demonstrate together with Cemex one specific industrially relevant application of our fully renewable, high-temperature solar heat.”

Cemex says the clinker was used to produce cement and was then further processed to produce concrete.

In the next phase of their joint research and development project, Cemex and Synhelion aim to produce solar clinker in larger quantities as they work toward an industrial-scale pilot at a cement plant.","Cemex, Synhelion produce clinker with solar heat"

Building materials supplier CEMEX is helping to meet growing customer demand for its products by adding ten new lower emission tippers to its own fleet, which boast upgraded safety features, a higher payload for increased efficiency and a step change in decarbonisation of its delivery fleet.

The new Volvo FM 460 8x4 tippers, which will feature CEMEX’s Future in Action branding, will work out of CEMEX’s depot in Angerstein and be used to deliver aggregates and sand to construction sites across the capital.

Thanks to their lightweight aluminium body, the business will be able to increase the amount of material transported in each load, while the engine meets the Euro 6 exhaust emissions requirements, which reduces nitrogen oxide (NOX) by 80% and particulate emissions by 50% compared with Euro 5.

By investing in more efficient, more sustainable vehicles CEMEX demonstrates again its commitment to decarbonisation of all aspects of its operations, and the management of its logistics fleet is central to this.

These vehicles all meet Transport for London’s Direct Vision Standard rating, thanks to their enhanced safety features. These include a side-scan system, while visual alerts are displayed on the windscreen if something is moving into the vehicle’s danger zone.

Furthermore, each truck’s cab features raised A-pillars that give it up to one extra cubic metre of space and more light. A large windscreen, low door line and modern mirrors ensures excellent all-round visibility which is improved further with an added lower window on each passenger door.

Nigel Ponton, Fleet Engineering Manager for CEMEX UK, said: “The addition of these new trucks to our fleet will enable us to better meet customer demand, safely and efficiently. Safety is the number one focus whenever we add new trucks to our operation and these Volvos tick every box in that respect.

""One of the reasons why these vehicles stood out for CEMEX was because of the improved visibility and layout of the day cabs – providing an ideal workplace for our drivers whilst aiding the safety of other road users.

“These trucks will all be working in busy streets across London so it’s imperative we provide our drivers with the best tools possible to do the job and help protect any vulnerable road users. Moreover, thanks to the improved fuel efficiencies and enhanced payload these new Volvos are the most sustainable vehicles we’ve ever had and will help decarbonise our delivery footprint.”",CEMEX expands logistics fleet with ten new lower emission tippers

(“CEMEX”) announced today that the Science Based Targets initiative (“SBTi”) has validated the company’s 2030 global carbon emissions targets, which are a key component of Future in Action, CEMEX´s program focused on developing low-carbon products, solutions, and processes to transition to a net-zero CO 2 company by 2050.

According to SBTi, the foremost authority on science-based climate action goals, CEMEX’s targets are in conformance with its criteria and recommendations to approve companies´ targets and in line with what the climate science deems necessary to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement – limiting global warming to well-below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit warming to 1.5°C.

CEMEX has the most ambitious 2030 targets for the cement industry, a reduction of the net GHG direct emissions of 40% vs. a 1990 baseline, meaning an expected reduction in direct (Scope 1) greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions of 20% per ton of cementitious material by 2030 from a 2020 base year. CEMEX has also committed to reduce its indirect electricity GHG emissions (scope 2) by 42% by 2030 from a 2020 base year.

“Climate action is the biggest challenge of our times. CEMEX is taking decisive action to address it by defining ambitious emissions reduction targets in line with the Science Based Targets initiative and executing against those targets,” said Fernando A. Gonzalez, CEO of CEMEX. “We commit to continue leading the industry in climate action not only because it creates value, but more importantly because it is the right thing to do. CEMEX is building a better future, and that future must be sustainable.”

Under its Future in Action program, CEMEX announced a climate action target of below 475 kg CO 2 , a >40% reduction in CO 2 emissions by 2030. The company´s clean electricity consumption will also increase from the current 29% in 2020 to 55% by 2030. This goals also align with the well-below 2°C scenario and enable the company to also reaffirm its 2050 goal of being net-zero carbon in concrete.

It has tested a process that converts flue gases emitted by a cement kiln into the carbon nanomaterials, thereby transforming ‘bad’ carbon into ‘good’ carbon.

Cemex is exploring and evaluating different applications of carbon nanomaterials to develop cement-based materials with novel and advanced performance, such as mechanical, chemical resistance, or thermal and electrical properties. Reintroducing CO 2 emissions in the construction value chain would boost the industry’s contribution to the circular economy, said Cemex.

The mechanical, thermal, electrical and chemical properties of carbon nanomaterials mean that they have potential applications in a wide array of industries. Nanomaterials include high-tech materials such as nanofibres, nanotubes, graphene and carbon black that have applications in areas including the electronics, automotive, agriculture, chemical, pharmaceuticals and textile sectors as well as construction.

The technology was born out of Smart Innovation, Cemex’s internal open innovation platform, and was one of the winners of the 2019 innovation competition. Cemex’s research and development team continued to develop the concept and has recently achieved promising results, with a carbon conversion rate of 50% in a lab setting. The next step is to scale the technology in a cement plant pilot within a year.

“This breakthrough technology is significant for Cemex, not only because it offers the potential to commercialise carbon emissions, but because it demonstrates the value of our Smart Innovation platform,” said Fernando A Gonzalez, CEO of Cemex. “The path to carbon neutrality will be built with innovation, and we remain committed to being at the forefront in developing new circular technologies and processes.”

“In the road leading up to the COP26 [UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties, due to be held in Glasgow on October 31-November 12, 2021], I am delighted to announce that we have signed the business ambition for 1.5°C and joined The Race to Zero Campaign,” said CEO Fernando González in the announcement, adding, “Cemex’s commitment to climate action runs deep.""

The company’s announcement followed last week’s comments from González in the company's 2Q21 results call detailing Cemex’s forward march on carbon reduction efforts, including alternative fuel changeover, executive compensation accountability, carbon reporting and third-party verification.

“We're accelerating our investment in the business in the positioning of our products for a low-carbon world, as well as moving quickly to the decarbonized power industry,” said González in the call.

The company, he added, is taking strides to accelerate results on carbon reduction, specifically upping its investments in alternative fuels and processes research, with Cemex integrating its climate transition goals into Cemex’s “operation resilience” plan implemented in 3Q20.

That strategy was intended to lift the company out of the pandemic by taking advantage of the opportunities from unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimuli, reaching investment grade and transforming Cemex into a more sustainable company that is resilient to long-term risks.

“With the roll-out of operation resilience in September 2020, our climate action agenda was escalated to our top priority,” said González in the 2Q21 results call. “We did this because we're committed to the belief that building a better future is wise, a green and sustainable world.”

González also detailed the company’s new 2030 target of below 475kg CO 2 per ton of cementitious product to be validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), as part of its commitment to meet its ambition of carbon neutrality by 2050, with the targets detailed in the following graphic.

The Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), is a joint initiative by global disclosure platform CDP, the UN Global Compact (UNGC), the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), which is intended to increase corporate ambition on climate action by mobilizing companies to set greenhouse gas emission reduction targets consistent with the decarbonization required to limit warming to less than 1.5-2.0ºC compared to pre-industrial temperatures.

“Again, we feel very confident that it's doable,” said the CEO with respect to reaching the targets. “To some extent, we have already done it in the case of Europe, with a reduction of 35% when we use figures based on 1990.”

SHOOTING FOR 1.5°C

In other comments during the call, González said the company was well set on a path below the 2°C limit seen as the result of a delayed climate response to reach carbon neutrality by 2065, whereas the 1.5°C target might be achievable by carbon emissions reaching the net-zero goal by 2050.

“The reason why we established this new target of 475kg CO 2 per ton of cement and 165kg per cubic meter is because we know and we're confident that we can achieve those without counting with any of the technologies – new technologies needed to capture CO2,” said González.

However, carbon capture technologies are exactly the “technologies that we are proactively investing in,” he said.

LEADING DECARBONIZATION

“We will continue to lead the industry in our efforts to decarbonize and the first step is establishing industry-leading carbon reduction rates,” added González, adding that transparency will be equally important in the next critical decade.

“Therefore, similar to our other key targets, we intend to provide quarterly updates on our climate action levers given the same visibility of all other key financial metrics,” he said.

González said the company’s search for alternative fuels was also advancing quickly and had already produced positive financial results, helping the company to avoid the higher pet coke prices seen in 2Q21.

ALTERNATIVE FUELS

The company is always looking to find the cheapest fuel sources while avoiding pet coke use for production, said González, “So, in the case of this second quarter, we did manage to increase the use of alternative fuels, and I think we were at the highest levels ever. It's close to 30%,” which had a direct impact on lower costs in the quarter.”

The company is also researching additional fillers, “like how to claim for blended cements on top of the ones we currently use, things like alternative raw materials for cement production and a number of other levers we have to manage that reduction,” the executive said.

Looking ahead, the company’s search for alternative fuels will continue with preference for those “with very high contents of biomass,” said González.

“We’re developing new projects of alternative fuels for our business in the US and, as you know, we’re close to finishing two very sizable alternative fuel projects in Europe, in the UK and in Germany,” he said.

With respect to the latter, in July Cemex announced a green hydrogen project in collaboration with renewable energy company Enertag and electrolysis firm Sunfire to launch “Concrete Chemicals”, a new hydrogen project to decarbonize the cement industry.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

The CEO added that company executives now have a personal stake in meeting targets, with a new executive compensation initiative launched early this year, the Cemex ETS program.

This “variable compensation” for executives, which González said is still in trial development through the second half of the year, is intended to link compensation with performance or underperformance on the company’s targets.","Cemex signs up to new climate pacts, with green programs in overdrive"

In a statement on Tuesday, Cemex said it now co-processes six kilograms of waste for every kilogram it generates. From 2016 to 2020, it was able to co-process 214,772 tons of waste compared to the waste generated by its cement facilities at 35,850 tons for the same period.

“Co-processing more than the waste we generate is proof-positive of our solid commitment in ensuring we are drivers of the circular economy, helping increase the use of waste as alternative fuels, reducing greenhouse gas emissions as these wastes provide replacement for fossil fuels,” Cemex President and Chief Executive Officer Ignacio Alejandro Mijares Elizondo said.

In a statement last year, Cemex said its co-processing procedure involves taking the plastic and rubber-based parts of waste materials, which will then undergo a pre-treatment process before being used to manufacture cement.

Meanwhile, the non-recyclable waste is converted into “usable heat to help power the cement kiln.”

“Co-processing helps divert these wastes which otherwise would end up in landfills and waterways,” Mr. Mijares said in the statement on Tuesday.

With the 214,772 tons of waste co-processed within the 2016 to 2020 period, the company said it was able to avoid 327,742 tons of CO 2 emissions. That translates to cutting emissions produced by 71,278 passenger vehicles in a year or 362,248 tons of coal burned.

In 2020, global Cemex said 91% of its plants collectively co-processed 2.7 million tons of waste to alternative fuels, which is equivalent to a 25.3% substitution rate and 1.6 million tons of coal replaced.

“We take earnest steps in making sure that we maximize environmental opportunities in our operations, including [the] use of alternative fuels through co-processing,” Mr. Mijares said.

The company has a “Future in Action” agenda that focuses on addressing climate change via cutting down CO 2 emissions by 35% and aims to reduce its emissions by 40% come 2030. The company hopes to invest $60 million every year for the program.

Cemex is also trying to improve its production efficiency as part of its climate action initiatives, such as investing in energy efficiency, using alternative fuels, expanding its use of renewable energy, and increasing its use of clinker substitution.

On Tuesday, shares of Cemex Holdings went up 0.93% or one centavo to close at P1.08 apiece. — Keren Concepcion G. Valmonte",Cemex says co-processing boosts climate initiatives
