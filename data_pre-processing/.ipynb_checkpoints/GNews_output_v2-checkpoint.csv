These companies were evaluated and ranked based on their sustainability efforts across six categories: renewable energy use; material sourcing and eco-design; technology use and eco-efficiency; waste reduction and circularity; green buildings and vehicles; and reporting and governance. Within those categories, ABI Research further identified 30 action items to score each company in the index for specifically reducing carbon emissions, water use, and waste across the industrial sector.

This assessment establishes the sustainability positioning of each profiled company—leaders, mainstream, and followers— and provides strategic recommendations for improvement.

Sustainability Leaders: Schneider Electric, Siemens, ABB, and Bosch

Sustainability Mainstream: Hitachi, General Electric, Honeywell, and LG

Sustainability Followers: Mitsubishi Corporation and Rockwell Automation

Kim Johnson, Sustainable Technologies Principal Analyst explains, ""Our assessment identified Schneider Electric, Siemens, ABB, and Bosch as the top four sustainability leaders. Schneider Electric integrates sustainability and energy management expertise into all its offerings, targeting carbon neutrality within its own operations by 2025, and 90% renewable energy use, 50% green material in its products, and 80% of revenue tied to its Green Premium standard by 2025. Siemens ranked in second place leading the index in industrial digital automation and green buildings and vehicles, while receiving solid scores for renewable energy use and reporting and governance. Siemens targets carbon neutrality by 2030. ABB was a leading technology implementer for industrial automation and robotics, and the group has set a target to reduce its customers' emissions by at least 100 megatons by 2030, equal to the annual emissions of around 30 million combustion vehicles, with carbon neutrality by 2030. Bosch achieved carbon neutrality for Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions in 2020 and led the index in global renewable energy use.

There are substantial differences in the value chain carbon emissions of companies like Mitsubishi producing heavy equipment, General Electric (GE) and Honeywell manufacturing aircraft engines and aerospace equipment, Hitachi producing construction machinery and transportation infrastructure, and Bosch manufacturing automotive parts and chips versus other companies with a higher percentage of digital automation solutions, software tools, and services. Some of the industrial companies in the index are still evaluating the full scale of their upstream and downstream Scope 3 emissions. ""Thus, the sustainability index is not a tool to directly compare the carbon footprints of the products and offerings of the conglomerate companies. Rather, the intent of the research is to discern several ambitious corporate sustainability programs and best practices to better understand what industrial sector leaders are doing to achieve their climate goals and reduce their environmental impact,"" Johnson concludes.

These findings are from ABI Research's Sustainability Assessment: Large Industrial Solution Providers competitive ranking report. This report is part of the company's Sustainable Technologies research service, which includes research, data, and ABI Insights. Competitive Ranking reports offer comprehensive analysis of implementation strategies and innovation, coupled with market share analysis, to offer unparalleled insight into a company's performance and standing in comparison to its competitors.

Environmentally-friendly operations along the Tagus river will transform metropolitan commuting in Portugal’s capital city

The new fleet will play an integral role in delivering Portugal’s goal of carbon neutrality by 2050

The first of ten new, all-electric ferries opens a new age of emission-free commuter services along Lisbon’s Tagus River, in the latest example of green transformation from Portugal’s capital city. The vessel, whose operations rely on an integrated power, automation, energy storage and propulsion solution from ABB, has now been delivered to the ferry operator Transtejo by the Astilleros Gondán shipyard. Replacing a fleet of older, fossil fuel-burning ferries, the 40-meter, 540-passenger vessels will also improve passenger comfort and reduce operational and maintenance costs.

“Delivering the first of these 10 ferries is an important milestone for us, and it is a joy to see her on the water in Lisbon. We very much look forward to delivering the other nine,” said Antonio Pacheco, Director of GRP Division, Astilleros Gondán.

Ferry electrification is a key part of Portugal’s strategy to reach carbon neutrality by 2050. Consolidating Lisbon’s reputation as one of the most environmentally-friendly cities in the world, the electric ferry program continues a transformative period for a municipality which won the 2020 European Green Capital award.

“Lisbon is making waves as a pioneer in environmentally-friendly public transportation, as many of the world’s cities realize the benefits electric ferries bring for sustainability,” said Juha Koskela, Division President, ABB Marine & Ports. “ABB’s leading position in integrated electrification solutions for urban ferries is a highly visible example of our work to make the maritime industry safer, smarter, and more sustainable. We at ABB are proud to play a key role in shaping shipping’s new reality.”

With power distribution managed by ABB Onboard DC Grid™ ensuring that output of each ship’s 1,860-kWh battery pack is safe, reliable and optimized, ABB estimates the new ferries will cut about 6,500 tons in CO 2 emissions along the Tagus river every year – equivalent to the emissions of 1,400 passenger cars.

ABB is also providing the control and rectifier systems for shore power as well as an advanced communications system which identifies the vessel arriving, its charging status and the power required, enabling the ferries to recharge within 5-10 minutes.

With latest figures from the Maritime Battery Forum[1] showing 586 battery powered vessels in operation worldwide, and 195 more on order, ferry owners remain at the forefront of switching to hybrid and electric vessel propulsion. ABB works closely with ferry companies around the world, supplying integrated hybrid and electric propulsion solutions.

This project for Statkraft helps to restore missing system inertia for the stable operation of the UK power grid.

ABB’s Synchronous Condensers Go Live at Europe’s Largest Renewable Power Generator

ABB has completed a major turnkey project for Statkraft, Europe’s largest renewable power generator, to help restore the missing system inertia vital for the stable operation of the UK power grid. This is essential as the country switches from fossil fuels to use more renewable energy such as wind and solar. The project features two ABB high-inertia synchronous condenser systems installed at the Lister Drive Greener Grid Park in Liverpool. They are now operational and supplying around one percent of the UK’s projected inertia requirement for 2025.



Traditionally, fossil-fuel powered turbines have provided the spinning inertia vital to maintain stable power networks. Now they are being decommissioned, so the inertia in the grid is decreasing. Innovative solutions like Greener Grid Parks are part of a broader scheme to restore the inertia that would be provided by five coal-fired power stations, saving UK consumers around $122 million over six years.



Synchronous condensers are large rotating machines that mimic the operation of coal or gas fired generators to provide an alternative source of spinning inertia. They have been deployed by ABB to reinforce power networks in many projects worldwide. However, Lister Drive is the first project anywhere in the world to feature a high-inertia configuration that couples a synchronous condenser with a 40 tonne flywheel. This approach increases the instantaneously available inertia by 3.5 times to ensure the network frequency and voltage are held stable within the tight limits essential to maintain grid reliability.



Heikki Vepsäläinen, division president of ABB Large Motors and Generators, said, “Decarbonization of power generation is a vital element in the world’s journey to net-zero. Our challenge is to achieve this ambition while maintaining stable and reliable power networks. This is where synchronous condensers are set to play a key role. So, we are delighted to have worked with Statkraft on this ground-breaking project that is already demonstrating how innovative technology can address the inertia challenge.”



The ABB high-inertia synchronous condenser systems were manufactured in Sweden and installed by ABB UK’s engineering team. To ensure round-the-clock availability for this vital system, Statkraft has signed a 10-year contract with ABB for planned and fast response maintenance services. A full suite of ABB Ability™ digital condition monitoring solutions are now deployed to optimize performance and predict maintenance needs. By assessing real-time data with cloud-based analysis, the team can plan corrective actions before issues occur, ensuring system reliability.



Statkraft is a leading company in hydropower internationally and Europe’s largest generator of renewable energy. The Group produces hydropower, wind power, solar power, gas-fired power and supplies district heating. Statkraft is a global company in energy market operations. Statkraft has 5300 employees in 21 countries.

By joining ABB in this endeavor, U.S. businesses have an opportunity to collectively reduce energy consumption, significantly slow the rate at which they are contributing to climate change — and mitigate the risk of overregulation.

These goals can be achieved by upgrading outdated industrial infrastructure with new generation energy-efficient technologies, such as high-efficiency motors and variable speed drives. The potential impact of this solution is illustrated in a recent report entitled “U.S. Industrial and Commercial Motor System Market Assessment Report,” co-authored by research scientist Dr. Prakash Rao, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, which highlights where some of the most prominent sources of energy wastage exist in our industrial and commercial infrastructure.

In most cases, according to ABB’s NEMA Motor Div. President Jesse Henson, the savings from a company’s increased energy efficiency can achieve a full return on the cost to install new generation technology within approximately two years of the original investment.

“While the adverse effects of climate change persist, ABB is investing in technologies which can help us all reduce our impact on the environment,” Henson said. “We now offer the most energy­efficient motors and drives in the industry, so we are choosing to actively lead that discussion and educate our industrial partners on how they can reduce their electricity consumption and effectively slow the rate of climate change in the process.”

In December, ABB hosted a virtual roundtable discussion to explore the high­efficiency solutions currently available on the market today and explain the proper course for affordable integration. The event explored the practical benefits and data of integrating high-efficiency solutions into existing industrial and commercial infrastructure to affordably and immediately reduce the impact of climate change. Attendees participating in the roundtable heard from featured guests included Dr. Rao, Henson, and ABB Motion President Morton Wierod.

“Now every commercial building and industrial process can be a part of a change in our climate and a solution. Motors and drives together just make the world a better place. By choosing to invest in these technologies and reducing the amount of electricity we consume, we can make a difference,” Henson said. “ABB is a part of the solution for a better planet. I believe it is our duty to make a difference for a better tomorrow. But we need your help to get the message out about this invisible climate solution.”

The Energy Efficiency Movement is a global forum of around 200 organizations sharing ideas, best practices and commitments to create a more energy-efficient world.

Published today, the “Industrial energy efficiency playbook” includes 10 actions that a business can take to improve its energy efficiency, reduce energy costs and lower emissions right now. It focuses on mature, widely available technology solutions that will deliver rapid results and ROI – and are capable of being deployed at scale.

“Energy efficiency is a win-win for companies and the climate,” said Kevin Lane, senior program manager, energy efficiency, with the International Energy Agency (IEA). “While industry needs to address climate change on all fronts – such as increasing use of renewable energy, investing in low-carbon processes and developing circular business models – energy efficiency stands out as the business-focused opportunity with the best near-term prospects for emission reductions. The 10 actions contained in this report are known, cost-effective resources, and can be employed at scale rapidly to help companies convert climate ambition into action.”

Industry is the world’s largest consumer of electricity, natural gas and coal, according to the IEA, accounting for 42 percent of total electricity demand, equal to more than 34 exajoules of energy.1 The iron, steel, chemical and petrochemical industries are the largest consumers of energy among the world’s top-five energy-consuming countries – China, United States, India, Russia and Japan. This energy consumption carries high costs in the current inflationary environment. It was also responsible for nine gigatons of CO 2 , equal to 45 percent of total direct emissions from end-use sectors in 2021, according to the IEA.

Organizations interviewed for the report include ABB, Alfa Laval, DHL Group, the IEA, Microsoft and ETH Zürich, the Swiss federal institute of technology. The contributors’ recommendations range from carrying out energy audits to right-sizing industrial machines that are often too big for the job at hand, which wastes energy. Moving data from on-site servers and into the cloud could help save around 90 percent of the energy consumed by IT systems.2 Speeding up the transition from fossil fuels, by electrifying industrial fleets, switching gas boilers to heat pumps or using well-maintained heat exchangers will also offer efficiencies.

Further actions involve installing sensors and real-time digital energy monitoring to reveal the presence of so-called “ghost assets” that use power when on stand-by, unlike a digital twin that can simulate efficiency actions without interrupting production. Using smart building solutions to control power systems, lighting, blinds and heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) will also save energy in industrial facilities.

Other recommendations include installing variable speed drives which can improve the energy efficiency of a motor-driven system by up to 30 percent, yielding immediate cost and emissions benefits. If the more than 300 million industrial electric motor-driven systems currently in operation were replaced with optimized, high-efficiency motors, global electricity consumption could be reduced by up to 10 percent.

“There are energy efficiency solutions available that can help industry mitigate climate change and drive down energy costs, without compromising performance and productivity,” said Tarak Mehta, president, Motion business area at ABB. “With recent technology advances in energy efficiency, the improvement potential in industry is significant and readily available. So, rather than turning the lights off and halting production to save money, this important new report explains practical steps executives can take to reduce energy use and their bills while maintaining current operations.”

Business leaders and experts wanting to learn more about reducing their energy costs and carbon emissions are invited to join a special panel event that dives deep on the opportunities presented in the report and how to capitalize on them. The event will take place at 4pm Central European Time / 10am Eastern on Tuesday, December 13, and will be available afterward as video on demand. Register here.

No single solution will be enough to meet this ambitious target. Industrial energy efficiency, for example, has a critical role to play in reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. An even more holistic approach is circularity, which aims to minimise resources use and emissions across the entire product life cycle.

Technology and business models based on a circular economy – where businesses create supply chains that recover or recycle the resources used to create their products – can make a significant contribution. This is because recycling eliminates emissions associated with retrieving raw materials through traditionally carbon-intensive industries like mining.

At ABB, we’ve set a target to take a circular approach to at least 80 percent of our products by 2030. An important example is our strategic partnership with Boliden, the Swedish mining and smelting company. This collaboration forms an integral part of ABB’s strategic ambition to reduce the environmental impact of raw materials used in our products by replacing them with lower carbon alternatives.

Resource-Efficient Partnership

ABB uses a great deal of copper to manufacture its motors and other industrial electrical equipment. However, the production of this vital material is very energy intensive.

Boliden has addressed this challenge by developing low-carbon copper that it mines using fossil-free energy. It also produces copper using secondary raw material from recycled products. The carbon footprint of these “green” copper products is 65 percent lower than the industry average.

The first step in our partnership involves switching to low-carbon and recycled copper to cover the demand for our IE5 Ultra-Premium Efficiency SynRM and e-mobility motors in Europe. This will enable a significant reduction in the carbon impact of the raw materials used in these products. For example, a 75kW motor weighing 650kg might include 80kg copper. Using Boliden’s copper, it is possible to save approximately 200kg of CO 2 emissions for each motor we manufacture – cancelling out emissions equivalent to burning 100kg of coal.

Upgrading to Energy-Efficient Motors

ABB also signed a memorandum of understanding with Boliden to support the mining and smelting company in identifying inefficient low-voltage motors across its operating units. These motors can then be replaced with high-efficiency motors within ABB’s take-back upcycling framework, with the old motors recycled to provide raw material for Boliden’s recycled copper.

Motor efficiency has improved rapidly over the past decade due to investment in research and development by manufacturers. For example, today’s IE4 motors deliver up to 40 percent lower energy losses than earlier IE2 models. If operators worldwide replaced their older motors with optimised, high-efficiency equipment, global electricity consumption would drop by up to 10 percent.

In addition to the environmental benefits, upgrading to more modern motors also makes good business sense. The reduction in energy bills often delivers payback in a matter of months with energy prices at their current high level.

Designing for Circularity

Apart from using recycled copper, ABB is committed to increasing the use of recycled electric steel (e-steel) and recycled aluminium. We have already designed our motors to be up to 98 percent recyclable, with the remaining two percent of materials available to be incinerated for heat recovery. Recycling copper, aluminium and steel offers significant energy savings compared to virgin production.

Ultimately, a widespread transition to more efficient technology can yield significant energy and emission reductions. However, this must be supported by collective, joined-up thinking to make circularity the norm rather than the exception.

Climate change is one of the most pressing issues of our time. According to the International Energy Agency, the oil and gas industry accounts for 45% of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions worldwide.

As the energy industry is the largest contributor to global GHG emissions, integrating renewable energy sources will be crucial in decreasing the carbon footprint of oil and gas operations in the coming decades. On the UK Continental Shelf, gas turbine-driven generators located on platforms account for approximately 70% of GHG emissions from offshore oil and gas installations.

Platform electrification refers to obtaining power from either onshore or offshore renewable sources, and using them to power oil and gas facilities. One of the leaders in this sector is ABB, which is using electrification, along with improving energy efficiency and carbon capture, utilisation, and storage, to help mitigate climate change. The company’s head of oil, gas and offshore power, Johan De Villiers, talks about the company’s long-term plans.

Smruthi Nadig: What is electrification, and how can it help reduce oil and gas emissions?

Johan De Villiers: The oil and gas production process, where emissions come from one source, is an area that we need to address. That’s high-quality infrastructure for the tech team where those leads are. And then the second category is from the power generation that supplies the oil and gas production process. So that’s a major source of emissions.

What happens for offshore production assets or offshore platforms is a single-cycle gas turbine fixes it. That is a convenient way of providing power, but not efficient.

What ABB has done is connect its production testing with shore power. So, the energy from shore is cleaner than those single-cycle gas turbines. And we have a large number of these powered from shore connections, which is a good example of using electrical equipment … and then using automation and digital solutions to manage the exchange of power.

Now it’s also possible to connect renewable energy to these production facilities. So that would be fixed or floating offshore wind. If it’s a land-based facility, it could be large-scale solar plants. We are instrumental in ensuring the integration of these intermittent sources [at] the production facility.

SN: What are electrification pathways, and what can you tell us about the subsea projects that would help your clients cut emissions by 2030?

JDV: In terms of electrification pathways, one is connecting production assets with cleaner power. [One] way in which electrification reduces emissions is what we call the launch step. So, when you have an oil and gas field, especially offshore, the points where you collect the oil or gas is further and further away from where your production process sits.

It is [crucial] to be able to place compression on the sea bed. If you provide electric power, that requires us to place transformers on the seabed and, that’s a key enabler that ABB has developed over the years.

In Australia, [at] the project Chevron, we do power from shore connection. So we have 120km of 100MW of electric power provided to the platform. And then from that platform, this last data solution with transformers on the seabed provides a very significant gain in the system’s overall efficiency. [There’s] a second benefit because of the equipment [placed] on the sub-seabed; because we don’t need the gas turbines on the platform, it is a fraction of the size that it would have been if we had the traditional approach.

As you know, steel production is one of the most carbon-intensive processes, [challenging] to attain. So anything we can do to reduce the size of the assets put out in the ocean significantly reduces the initial carbon footprint of these projects.

SN: Company report shows that ABB’s greenhouse gas emissions have been reduced by 39% from 2019 to 2021, and you plan to reduce the emissions by 80% by 2030. How do you see that happening?

JDV: It is all [about] the solutions. To maximise efficiency in digital solutions, you need to understand the efficiency with which the different parts of your production process convert energy into practical work and where the waste is. Then you can intervene with high variable speed drives, high-efficiency motors, energy management solutions that engage renewable energy, and battery storage solutions.

There’s a whole range of solutions that we can utilise to reduce the carbon footprint. There’s also the possibility of integrating renewable energy into the planet.

SN: Do you think electrification could succeed globally at a time of high demand for oil and gas? If yes, how so?

JDV: There’s high energy demand. The [most prominent] part comes from oil and gas. So you can say this is what the demand is really for energy. We see customers from every geography in the world taking the steps that are [cleaner options, like] carbon capture, carbon storage and production of hydrogen from renewable sources.

The integration of offshore wind is a [viable] solution. So you get this wonderful spectrum of solutions and activities that [aim to reduce] carbon footprint and enable the energy system of the future, which is positive.",Offshore electrification: ABB on cutting oil and gas emissions

The award, which was presented by Lena Westerholm, ABB Robotics’ Global Sustainability/HSE Manager, at a live-streamed ceremony broadcast from ABB headquarters in Zürich, was for the company’s fully automated mobile packaging system.

RMGroup is the original innovator of containerised, mobile bag filling and palletising solutions, having launched the first mobile packaging system in 2005. Designed and manufactured at their production facility in mid-Wales, the company offers both manual and automated bagging systems, containing either form fill and seal, or bag placers for pre-made bags. All options are supplied with ABB robot palletising cells. The inclusion of an ABB robot provides flexibility in the palletising process, which requires little space in an articulated trailer or shipping container.

RMGroup’s mobile line has provided increased flexibility, such as in ports or quarries where they play a key role in extraction or delivery processes. Centralising packing operations at source also provides environmental benefits, as the haulage of raw material to the packing plant is eliminated, thereby reducing carbon emissions and saving energy, time and money.

On receipt of the award, RMGroup’s Rosie Davies said: It’s an honour to receive this award today on behalf of the entire team at RMGroup. It is a testament to the passion and enthusiasm of the engineers within our business, who work hard to ensure that the company is always at the forefront of innovative packaging and robotic solutions. We thank our ABB family for their continued support for many years of collaboration and hopefully more to come.”

Steve Banton, Channel Partner Manager, ABB Robotics UK & IRE, added: “We are ecstatic to see our wonderful partner RM Group win this prestigious award. Winning the category against very strong competition from Europe, is something that the whole RM team should be incredibly proud of.

These companies were evaluated and ranked based on their sustainability efforts across six categories: renewable energy use; material sourcing and eco-design; technology use and eco-efficiency; waste reduction and circularity; green buildings and vehicles; and reporting and governance. Within those categories, ABI Research further identified 30 action items to score each company in the index for specifically reducing carbon emissions, water use, and waste across the industrial sector.

This assessment establishes the sustainability positioning of each profiled company—leaders, mainstream, and followers— and provides strategic recommendations for improvement.

Sustainability Leaders: Schneider Electric, Siemens, ABB, and Bosch

Sustainability Mainstream: Hitachi, General Electric, Honeywell, and LG

Sustainability Followers: Mitsubishi Corporation and Rockwell Automation

Kim Johnson, Sustainable Technologies Principal Analyst explains, ""Our assessment identified Schneider Electric, Siemens, ABB, and Bosch as the top four sustainability leaders. Schneider Electric integrates sustainability and energy management expertise into all its offerings, targeting carbon neutrality within its own operations by 2025, and 90% renewable energy use, 50% green material in its products, and 80% of revenue tied to its Green Premium standard by 2025. Siemens ranked in second place leading the index in industrial digital automation and green buildings and vehicles, while receiving solid scores for renewable energy use and reporting and governance. Siemens targets carbon neutrality by 2030. ABB was a leading technology implementer for industrial automation and robotics, and the group has set a target to reduce its customers' emissions by at least 100 megatons by 2030, equal to the annual emissions of around 30 million combustion vehicles, with carbon neutrality by 2030. Bosch achieved carbon neutrality for Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions in 2020 and led the index in global renewable energy use.

There are substantial differences in the value chain carbon emissions of companies like Mitsubishi producing heavy equipment, General Electric (GE) and Honeywell manufacturing aircraft engines and aerospace equipment, Hitachi producing construction machinery and transportation infrastructure, and Bosch manufacturing automotive parts and chips versus other companies with a higher percentage of digital automation solutions, software tools, and services. Some of the industrial companies in the index are still evaluating the full scale of their upstream and downstream Scope 3 emissions. ""Thus, the sustainability index is not a tool to directly compare the carbon footprints of the products and offerings of the conglomerate companies. Rather, the intent of the research is to discern several ambitious corporate sustainability programs and best practices to better understand what industrial sector leaders are doing to achieve their climate goals and reduce their environmental impact,"" Johnson concludes.

To reach UN water targets by 2030, global wastewater treatment capacity needs to increase by 8.56 billion cubic meters each year.

ABB Reveals an Additional 8.56 Billion Cubic Meters of Wastewater a Year Must Be Treated to Meet UN Goals

Global wastewater treatment capacity needs to increase annually by 8.56 billion cubic meters and investment in an additional 469 treatment facilities per year is required to meet United Nations (UN) goals. These are the findings of independent research commissioned by ABB ahead of World Water Day (WWD) on March 22, 2023.



As the UN prepares to report on progress made against its Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), ABB’s research focuses on SDG 6.3 which aims to improve water quality by halving the proportion of untreated wastewater globally, increasing recycling, and minimizing the release of hazardous materials. The UN says 2.2 billion people lack access to safely managed drinking water, while more than 4.2 billion people lack safely managed sanitation.



However, treating wastewater is energy intensive, with the industry consuming up to 3% of the world’s total energy output and contributing to over 1.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions.



“This research proves more needs to be done to help support the UN goals and accelerate progress in tackling water scarcity,” said Brandon Spencer, president of ABB Energy Industries. “But we need to ensure we are achieving these wastewater treatment targets in the most energy and resource efficient way possible to make it sustainable. This is where technology is key.”



While increasing wastewater treatment capacity is a priority, the early integration of technology to drive efficiency at plants is also vital. ABB’s automation, electrification and digital solutions are helping monitor, analyze and manage wastewater plant operations. In association with crucial measurement and control solutions, which collect and transmit a wealth of operational and diagnostic data, ABB systems help optimize resource efficiency and reduce energy consumption.



Development Economics, which has over 20 years’ research experience, utilized the same data employed by the UN to assess what real-term measures are needed. Based on modelling using a 50-million-liter daily capacity wastewater treatment plant as the benchmark, a further 469 treatment facilities–the volume equivalent of 3.4 million Olympic swimming pools–is required each year.



The scale of the challenge linked to UN SDG 6.3 is highlighted in a report from 2021 assessing the volumes of wastewater collected, treated, and reused. The research, which is used by the UN, concludes that 48% or 171.3 billion cubic meters of wastewater is uncollected or untreated annually. To meet SDG 6.3–which targets halving the proportion of untreated wastewater by 2030–these figures need to be reduced to 24% and 85.65 billion cubic meters.



In 2022, ABB’s Energy Transition Equation report analyzed how better use of wastewater could relieve pressure on water supplies through greater integration of automation and digital technologies:

Wastewater sites can reduce carbon emissions by up to 2,000 tons per annum

With more than 50,000 plants worldwide, 100 million tons of CO 2 could be saved each year

could be saved each year By applying a package of automation and digital solutions, water companies can reduce carbon emissions as well as deliver annual operational savings of up to $1.2 million per plant

The upgrade has enabled LondonEnergy to improve the plant’s resilience and enable the connection of an additional steam turbine, which will increase annual green energy production to 1,000 megawatt-hours (MWh), equivalent to the electricity consumption of 80,000 homes and businesses.

“By upgrading our existing EfW plant, we have renewed confidence in our ability to keep waste out of landfill and minimise our carbon footprint. The new system allows us to monitor, control and automate the entire EfW plant’s electrical assets from one touch-screen user interface,” said Charles Bell, LondonEnergy’s E&I Manager.

An important feature of the project is the ABB Ability™ Electrification Monitoring and Control ZEE600, one of the first to be deployed in the UK. It acts as a hub to integrate data from five generators, as well as power distribution systems, grid connection, and drives and motors in waste-handling units. Operators interact with the system via a touch-screen interface that gives visibility and control, as well as access to alerts and historic performance data.

ABB supplied a total of 63 panels of UniGear ZS1 11 (kV) double busbar and 3.3 kV single busbar electrical switchgear to protect service continuity and provide redundant power capability. VD4G generator circuit breakers (GCBs) were selected to meet the most stringent requirements for generator applications. Their fault-handling capability was established by a power study that enabled the team to replicate the installation’s original electrical parameters. On top of offering comprehensive generator protection, ABB’s advanced Relion® REX640 relays are also able to automatically perform generator breaker synchronization, a crucial task for safe connection to the grid.

The project required upgrading of four original generators and interfacing them with a modern digital control system, as well as adding a new generator. To achieve this, ABB’s global experts in power studies and consulting delivered in-depth modelling and analysis, before developing a scheme that seamlessly combines the existing and new technologies. ABB also delivered training to help LondonEnergy’s operators transition to the latest control technology.

“Extending the life of an existing facility can have huge sustainability benefits by avoiding or delaying construction of a new site. When it was built 50 years ago, the original engineers could never have foreseen that we would integrate their generators into a modern digital control system,” said Stephen Gibbs, ABB’s UK Product Marketing Director for Distribution Solutions. “Our extensive research, modelling and simulations showed that it is possible to upgrade existing assets and it’s an approach that we can replicate elsewhere.”

ABB shared energy transition insights at summit attended by Norwegian Crown Prince Haakon and the UK Secretary of State for New Energy and Net Zero Grant Shapps.

Appointment with Royalty for ABB’s Offshore Wind Electrification Solutions

An ABB delegation joined Norwegian Crown Prince Haakon and the UK’s Secretary of State for New Energy and Net Zero, Grant Shapps MP, at an energy transition summit on Wednesday, March 1 in London. The one-day event, attended by 500 energy business leaders and government officials from Norway and the UK, strengthened collaborations between the two countries to achieve net zero by 2050.



The event emphasized the significance of policy frameworks, investments, advancement in digitalization and artificial intelligence and cross-border cooperation between the United Kingdom and Norway. It also sought to address the challenges and solutions to reduce emissions intensity in the production of offshore oil and gas through electrification and offshore wind power.



With more than 40 years’ experience as a technology leader in power generation, management and control of offshore wind, ABB was invited to present how the electrification of offshore facilities and the integration of renewables can help accelerate the energy transition.



“It was an honour to be able to demonstrate to this summit how ABB’s electrification, automation and digitalization technologies are playing a key role in electrifying offshore assets with renewables, integrating offshore wind into the energy mix to help reduce industrial CO2 emissions,” said Asmund Maland, senior vice president Subsea and Offshore Power at ABB Energy Industries. “Such technology also enhances safety, drives productivity, ensures reliability and increases efficiency for offshore energy producers.”



The environmental benefits of offshore wind extend beyond boosting the amount of clean energy in the overall mix. For example, at Hywind Tampen in the Norwegian North Sea – the world’s first floating windfarm to power oil and gas platforms–offshore wind generation is being used to decarbonize hydrocarbon projects. Supplying renewable electricity to oil and gas fields reduces the emissions per barrel of the oil produced. ABB’s scope of work on the project includes an automation solution that controls the power generation from the windfarm so it can be connected to the oil and gas operations.



The UK is committed to becoming a clean energy superpower by the end of this decade. In December 2022, the government signed an agreement on offshore renewable energy cooperation with the EU and North Sea countries. The collaboration of development of offshore renewable energy and grid infrastructure will support the UK’s target to increase offshore wind fivefold to 50 GW by 2030.



“For both the UK and Norway, enhancing our energy security and independence is an absolute priority – moving away from volatile international markets in fossil fuels and towards greater use of alternative energy sources,” said Grant Shapps MP, Secretary of State for New Energy and Net Zero. “Today’s extension of the historic partnership between our two nations–will do just that, boosting our use of the latest green technologies to ensure security of supply, and increasing cooperation on the latest innovations and developments that will maintain our positions as world leaders in this field.”

The world’s most potent greenhouse gas has been replaced with an alternative that its developers say is much more sustainable in several railway switchgears in Germany.

Commonly used in electrical switchgears and other energy infrastructure for its excellent insulation properties, sulfur hexafluoride (SF 6 ) has a global warming potential 25,200-times that of carbon dioxide and lasts in the atmosphere for about 3,200 years.

With ambitious plans to decarbonise the German rail network by 2040 and eliminate use of SF 6 in its switchgear, Deutsche Bahn awarded Swedish-Swiss multinational ABB a contract to supply its first three-phase gas insulated switchgear solutions that are free of SF 6 . The technology will be used in four charging substations dedicated to battery-powered trains for Schleswig-Holstein, the northernmost state of Germany.

The devices replace SF 6 with AirPlus, which ABB described as a “sustainable gas mixture” that almost eliminates global warming potential.

“ABB’s SF 6 -free technology offers an interesting alternative to conventional assets, especially in terms of eliminating harmful greenhouse gases,” said Thomas Wehr, product manager at Deutsche Bahn’s Rail Power Systems contractor. “The switchgear can be integrated into our substation design without any problems.”

Other features of the new switchgears include ‘run flat’ technology, designed to enable continued operation in the event of a leak. The devices are designed to generate 20% less heat than conventional options, and integrated sensors can enable remote monitoring.

The European Commission recently proposed plans to ban SF 6 from new medium voltage electrical equipment from 2026 for applications up to 24kV, and from 2030 for applications up to 52kV.

The vessel, Boreas, is due for delivery to the owner in the second part of 2024, and it is said that it will be one of the largest and most technologically advanced hybridized units of the type in operation, measuring 175 meters in length.

It will be able to lift over 3,000 tons and will feature 126-meter-tall legs allowing it to operate at depths of up to 70 meters jacked up, with a capacity to install up to 20 megawatts (MW) offshore wind turbines.

""Boreas will be equipped with four Azipod propulsion units with a combined propulsion power of 16 megawatts, offering significant space and weight savings as well as facilitating optimal ship design, allowing the vessel to transport heavier loads. In addition, ABB’s hybrid-electric propulsion system is fully future-proof as it allows the integration of new energy sources once they become available,"" ABB said.

Azipod propulsion is a gearless steerable propulsion system where the electric drive motor is housed within a pod outside the ship hull. Azipod units can rotate 360 degrees, increasing maneuverability and operating efficiency of vessel while cutting fuel consumption by up to 20 percent compared to conventional shaftline systems.

“ABB is our long-term partner, and I believe we can enhance the business relationship with ABB by working together for Van Oord Jack-Up Vessel” said Shiyan Sun, Director, Supply Chain Management Centre, Yantai CIMC Raffles Shipyard. “The ease of installing the Azipod system was another key factor in our decision to contract ABB; it is a matter of plugging the ready-made units into the vessel hull, saving considerable time and effort in the construction process.”

ABB’s package includes a closed-ring configuration for safer, more efficient, and more predictable operations.

""Furthermore, through its spinning-reserve and peak-load-shaving capabilities, ABB’s energy storage system will act as a back-up power source while reducing engine running hours to minimize wear and fuel consumption,"" ABB said.

Remote diagnostic system

Van Oord will also be able to use the ABB Ability Marine Remote Diagnostic System for continuous remote equipment monitoring, as well as optimized machinery and planned maintenance activities, helping reduce maintenance costs. Meanwhile, the ABB Ability OCTOPUS – Marine Advisory System will enable performance management, predictive maintenance and voyage optimization.

“We are proud to have been chosen to provide power and propulsion for Boreas, based on our experience in the offshore JUV market and our ability to tailor products and solutions to the needs of the owner, operator and shipyard,” said Rune Braastad, Global Business Line Manager, Marine Systems, ABB Marine & Ports. “This project further confirms that our integrated package comprising power, energy storage, automation, control and digital solutions is the preferred choice for vessels that need to be future-proof and environmentally friendly.”

Northern Lights, a joint venture between energy majors Equinor, Shell and TotalEnergies, is said to be the first industrial carbon capture and storage (CCS) project to develop an open and flexible infrastructure to safely store CO2 from industries across Europe.

The first phase of the project is due to be completed in mid-2024 and will have the capacity to permanently store up to 1.5 million tons of CO2 per year, with the ambition to expand to over five million tons per year in a second development phase.

The two vessels will support the Northern Lights CCS project by transporting greenhouse gas from industrial emitters to an onshore terminal in Øygarden, Norway. From there, the CO2 will be delivered by pipeline to dedicated reservoirs 2,600 meters under the seabed in the North Sea for permanent storage.

Each of the 130-meter ships will be able to carry up to 7,500 cubic meters of liquefied C02 in purpose-built pressurised cargo tanks.\

ABB’s permanent magnet shaft generator system is expected to increase the fuel efficiency of these ships, reducing emissions as a result. Combining this technology with variable-speed engines allows harvesting power for all onboard systems through the rotating force of the shaft, significantly improving performance compared to a traditional setup with fixed speed engines, according to the company.

The CO2 carriers, which are due for delivery in 2024, will be constructed by the Chinese shipbuilder Dalian Shipbuilding Industry Company (DSIC).

“As a longstanding partner of ABB, we are delighted to offer shipping companies the efficiencies, ease of installation and space savings enabled by permanent magnet shaft generator systems,” said a Dalian Shipbuilding Industry Company spokesperson.

ABB announced in June 2022 that it will also deliver the main electrical, automation and safety systems for the Northern Lights project, enabling the remote operation of the terminal and ensuring that the facility runs at optimum efficiency.

ABB’s scope of supply also covers full engineering and commissioning services. In addition, the vessels will have access to the ABB Ability Marine Remote Diagnostic System for continuous equipment monitoring, optimized machinery and planned-maintenance activities, and reduced maintenance costs.

CCS plays an important role in meeting global climate and energy goals. Today, CCS facilities around the world have the capacity to capture more than 40 million tons of CO2 from power and industrial facilities, according to IEA.

While the transport of trapped CO2 to permanent storage locations by pipeline is already deployed at a large scale, it can present a challenge when the point of capture is further removed from a storage facility. Ships offer a flexible solution for long-distance CO2 transportation.

Throughout April the demonstration will feature in a window display an ABB robot 3D printing a variety of personalized designer objects made from Parley Ocean Plastic® – intercepted marine plastic debris collected from Parley’s Global Cleanup network.

The 3D printing demonstration is part of Selfridges’ SUPERMARKET concept, which challenges consumers to think about how the goods they purchase are produced and the impact of this production on the environment.

“While expanded choice is great for consumers, it also comes at a cost to the environment, with products and packaging often being discarded with little thought about where they end up or whether they get recycled,” says Marc Segura, ABB’s Robotics Division President. “By re-using plastic from the world’s oceans to print designer objects, we help to highlight the important contribution of robots in creating the sustainable manufacturing processes central to a circular economy.”

Developed in partnership with environmental organization and global network, Parley for the Oceans, and innovative design brand Nagami, the demonstration will use ABB’s simulation software RobotStudio® and an IRB 6700 robot to create a variety of printed furniture, homeware, and other objects made from Parley Ocean Plastic. The robot will work with Nagami’s unique plastic extruder to print the objects, which can be selected by customers on a screen and made to order on the premises.

“Parley Ocean Plastic was invented to catalyze change in response to marine plastic pollution and the destruction of our oceans,” says Parley founder and CEO Cyrill Gutsch. ""Working with two industry leaders, ABB and Nagami, we can now print on demand anywhere in the world to turn a problem into a solution. Beyond the huge potential for reducing waste by printing directly inside retail locations like Selfridges, we want to use this technology to empower local communities across the globe – giving them the tools to turn local plastic pollution into business opportunities and useful objects. For the oceans, climate and life.”

Robotic transformation of the retail experience

As well as underlining the importance of eco-innovation, the demonstration will also help to highlight the wider potential of robotic automation in helping retailers attract customers into their stores. Robots are already being used in increasing numbers in inventory and delivery management and in-store services, with research organization Coherent Market Insights1 estimating a 30 percent growth in the uptake of robots in retail by 2028.

“Robots are increasingly used to help draw customers back to the high street,” says Segura. “We believe that future adoption will be influenced by three main trends including micro-fulfilment, where robots are used in-store to enable order fulfilment and delivery; personalization, where a robot makes a product to a customer’s specific requirements, with the added option of automatic personalization where data on previous purchasing habits is used to offer new choices; and ‘retailtainment’, where the robot is used as part of an interactive display or show to inform or entertain customers.”

One example is ABB’s robotic demo at German fashion retailer Solebox’s store in Berlin, which picks shoes selected by customers using a screen. If the shoe doesn’t fit or the customer would like to try something else, the robot picks it up from the drawer and returns it to the shelf. In China, a retail kiosk developed by Chinese mobile communications company, Huawei in conjunction with ABB, allows customers to collect a range of devices including smartphones and tablets. Designed to be situated in high street locations, the kiosk uses ABB’s FlexBuffer system to select devices either ordered online or purchased onsite. Once selected, the products are placed into a collection drawer for the customer to take away.

“The ability to introduce robots into their stores both behind and in front of the counter offers exciting opportunities for retailers,” concludes Marc Segura. “By using robots to handle in-store micro-fulfilment operations, staff can be released to people-facing roles, allowing them to focus more on providing customers with a better all-round experience.

“As demonstrated by the installation at Selfridges, robots can also be used on the shop floor to enable personalized production of goods at the point of consumption, adding a whole new dimension to the retail experience.”

This new customer segment broadens ABB’s portfolio as part of a wider strategy to accelerate expansion into new and high-growth segments including logistics, healthcare, and construction.

Credit: Eneti / ABB.

Swiss automation firm ABB has won an order of nearly $27m to deliver power, automation and control systems, as well as real-time performance analytics and electric propulsion, for Eneti’s two newbuild wind turbine installation vessels (WTIV).

Eneti will receive the $330m ship duo from South Korean shipyard Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering (DSME) between Q3 2024 and Q2 2025.

The newbuilds will be able to deploy turbines offshore at depths of up to 65m.

Furthermore, they will be designed to operate on zero-carbon fuels after future modifications.

For increased sustainability in operations, the ships will be installed with a battery from ABB.

ABB’s integrated automation, power and electric propulsion systems, including closed-ring and closed-bus solutions, are expected to enhance the capabilities of Eneti’s ships.

In a statement, ABB said: “The closed bus-tie DP2 system’s enhanced fault resistance ensures precise positioning as well as safe and predictable performance during operation. Closed-bus solutions are less sensitive to network disturbances and reduce risks of power and propulsion loss.

“They also achieve better running engine utilisation to improve efficiency and support advanced remote diagnostics.”

ABB will also deploy an energy storage solution for minimising fuel consumption, wear and tear, and engine running hours.

With ABB’s battery power, it is said that the WTIVs will have better operational flexibility, offering ‘spinning reserve’ backup power, ‘peak shaving’ for short-term load variation and improved dynamic performance.

Due to ABB’s digital technologies providing more availability, the ships are said to also support increased profitability.

ABB Marine and Ports marine systems business line manager Rune Braastad said: “This contract further confirms that our solutions meet the needs of a very demanding market and are recognised for their operational and environmental performance.

“The Eneti ‘seal of approval‘ acknowledges their preference for our sustainable hybrid propulsion technology and extensive experience with dynamically positioned (DP) vessels, and WTIVs in particular.

The first of ten new, all-electric ferries opens a new age of emission-free commuter services along Lisbon’s Tagus River, in the latest example of green transformation from Portugal’s capital city.

The vessel, whose operations rely on an integrated power, automation, energy storage and propulsion solution from ABB, has now been delivered to the ferry operator Transtejo by the Astilleros Gondán shipyard.

Replacing a fleet of older, fossil fuel-burning ferries, the 40-meter, 540-passenger vessels will also improve passenger comfort and reduce operational and maintenance costs.

“Delivering the first of these 10 ferries is an important milestone for us, and it is a joy to see her on the water in Lisbon. We very much look forward to delivering the other nine,” said Antonio Pacheco, Director of GRP Division, Astilleros Gondán

Ferry electrification is a key part of Portugal’s strategy to reach carbon neutrality by 2050. Consolidating Lisbon’s reputation as one of the most environmentally-friendly cities in the world, the electric ferry program continues a transformative period for a municipality which won the 2020 European Green Capital award.

“Lisbon is making waves as a pioneer in environmentally-friendly public transportation, as many of the world’s cities realize the benefits electric ferries bring for sustainability,” said Juha Koskela, Division President, ABB Marine & Ports.

“ABB’s leading position in integrated electrification solutions for urban ferries is a highly visible example of our work to make the maritime industry safer, smarter, and more sustainable. We at ABB are proud to play a key role in shaping shipping’s new reality.”

With power distribution managed by ABB Onboard DC Grid™ ensuring that output of each ship’s 1,860-kWh battery pack is safe, reliable and optimized, ABB estimates the new ferries will cut about 6,500 tons in CO2 emissions along the Tagus river every year – equivalent to the emissions of 1,400 passenger cars.

ABB is also providing the control and rectifier systems for shore power as well as an advanced communications system which identifies the vessel arriving, its charging status and the power required, enabling the ferries to recharge within 5-10 minutes.

With latest figures from the Maritime Battery Forum* showing 586 battery powered vessels in operation worldwide, and 195 more on order, ferry owners remain at the forefront of switching to hybrid and electric vessel propulsion.

ABB works closely with ferry companies around the world, supplying integrated hybrid and electric propulsion solutions. Recent projects include the Maid of the Mist Niagara Falls tour boats, ‘Fusion Class’ ships for P&O Ferries, a new ferry connecting mainland Iceland and Vestmannaeyjar island, and ferry conversions for Swedish owner ForSea Ferries.

MARCH 2, 2023

An ABB delegation joined Norwegian Crown Prince Haakon and the UK’s Secretary of State for New Energy and Net Zero, Grant Shapps MP, at an energy transition summit on Wednesday 1 March in London. The one-day event, attended by 500 energy business leaders and government officials from Norway and the UK, strengthened collaborations between the two countries to achieve net zero by 2050.

The event emphasized the significance of policy frameworks, investments, advancement in digitalization and artificial intelligence and cross-border cooperation between the United Kingdom and Norway. It also sought to address the challenges and solutions to reduce emissions intensity in the production of offshore oil and gas through electrification and offshore wind power.

With over 40 years of experience as a technology leader in power generation, management and control of offshore wind, ABB was invited to present how the electrification of offshore facilities and the integration of renewables can help accelerate the energy transition.

“It was an honor to be able to demonstrate to this summit how ABB’s electrification, automation and digitalization technologies are playing a key role in electrifying offshore assets with renewables, integrating offshore wind into the energy mix to help reduce industrial CO2 emissions,” said Asmund Maland, Senior Vice President Subsea and Offshore Power at ABB Energy Industries. “Such technology also enhances safety, drives productivity, ensures reliability and increases efficiency for offshore energy producers.”

The environmental benefits of offshore wind extend beyond boosting the amount of clean energy in the overall mix. For example, at Hywind Tampen in the Norwegian North Sea – the world’s first floating wind farm to power oil and gas platforms – offshore wind generation is being used to decarbonize hydrocarbon projects. Supplying renewable electricity to oil and gas fields reduces the emissions per barrel of the oil produced. ABB’s scope of work on the project includes an automation solution that controls the power generation from the wind farm so it can be connected to the oil and gas operations.

The UK is committed to becoming a clean energy superpower by the end of this decade. In December 2022, the government signed an agreement on offshore renewable energy cooperation with the EU and North Sea countries. The collaboration of the development of offshore renewable energy and grid infrastructure will support the UK’s target to increase offshore wind fivefold to 50 GW by 2030.

“For both the UK and Norway, enhancing our energy security and independence is an absolute priority – moving away from volatile international markets in fossil fuels and towards greater use of alternative energy sources,” said Grant Shapps MP, Secretary of State for New Energy and Net Zero. “Today’s extension of the historic partnership between our two nations – will do just that, boosting our use of the latest green technologies to ensure the security of supply, and increasing cooperation on the latest innovations and developments that will maintain our positions as world leaders in this field.”

According to the manufacturer, HydroCool XT is quiet and versatile, and offers reduced maintenance and high performance in some of the toughest environments. Water-jacket cooling offers higher thermal conductivity than air cooling, helping to extend the motor life while eliminating the need for fans or air filters. Available with induction or permanent magnet rotor technology, the motor can achieve the highest level (IE5) efficiency rating for energy savings, and the motor’s power-dense solution delivers more power in a smaller footprint than similarly sized totally enclosed, fan-cooled motors, ABB said.

“The power- and torque-dense design of the HydroCool XT reduces its size, and since the cooling is built into the frame, there is no need for extra space around the motor for air flow,” said Matt Felt, Global Product Manager, Baldor-Reliance Navy & Marine Motors. “The motor is quieter than comparable air-cooled motors, and it’s able to achieve high efficiency ratings. These features result in a smaller physical footprint and lower overall operating costs when compared to similarly powered motors.”

The motor is available in four frame sizes from 60-1,250 horsepower (45-932 kW). Cooling efficiency is maintained even at lower speeds, allowing HydroCool XT to operate direct on line or as a variable speed motor without derating or power loss, ideal for constant torque applications. Shaft grounding is standard, and like most ABB products, HydroCool XT is equipped with provisions for ABB Ability Smart Sensor condition monitoring to provide instant information on the health and performance of the motor, providing connectivity and data analytics to make operations efficient, predictable and safe.",ABB Unveils New Water-cooled Motor Line

“To be scalable and to disrupt, I needed to step outside the machine and do it from the bottom up,” Liedtke told FN. “We want to be the first 100% regenerative fashion brand, we want to pilot the whole thing, so we can then offer it as a service to the industry.”

Unless, a label with a streetwear lean, has already made significant strides in sustainable fashion after just two years. Its apparel, which debuted in November 2021, is made with only biodegradable, plant-based materials, to eliminate plastic waste. And the company created a takeback program that repairs, recycles or composts used products.

To boost awareness and foster collaboration, it is lining up a string of compelling partnerships. Its first was with Mammut for a hoodie and T-shirt released on World Mountain Day last December. “The collab was about protecting the places they play. It was cool and it exploded,” Liedtke said. “This is our model, to show what we offer is a great story to tell consumers and to build consumer advocacy — and it helps build our audience.”

Liedtke said three other collaborations in the works, though he remained mum on details.

Unless has also made inroads on sustainable footwear. In December, the brand revealed its first shoe, a skate style dubbed the Degenerate.

It was created with several plant-based materials from innovation company Natural Fiber Welding, including Pliant outsoles, Tunera foam midsoles, Mirum for the eyelet and mudguards and more. Also, the shoe was created to decompose at the end of its life.

Story continues

After selling out last December, Unless restocked the Degenerate in February, and it is available via Unlesscollective.com for $139.

Having proven its methods can yield market-ready product, Unless is now looking collaborate with the sneaker giants. “Our role is to show there is a better way, to show the momentum of the product and then talk to brands to partner,” Liedtke said. “I can now offer this to brands and say, ‘I have a solution, let’s do collections together, let’s do some things that can be fun.’”

For many in the sustainability space, performance footwear has been off limits because of quality concerns around eco-friendly materials. But after creating a cupsole skate shoe, Liedtke is confident performance-based styles are possible.

“We did this shoe inside of two-and-a-half years, so your running shoe is going to be there. It’s a capital raise away,” he declared.

For now, Unless does have more releases on the horizon. Liedtke said the brand has found tooling it likes and will pair it with different uppers, though the concept is still in the prototyping stage.

As for its retail strategy, Unless is branching out beyond its DTC channel to launch wholesale at the end of 2023. It is targeting streetwear doors and those in the surf-skate space.

“The criteria is: You have to tell the story,” Liedtke said. “Product times story makes a difference to the consumer. If you don’t have that story, what’s the reason to buy a shoe? You can’t just put our shoe on the shelf next to 1,000 Air Force 1s, Dunks or Jordans.”

A fifth of Global 100 companies are US-based, making it the leading country for members of the index, followed by Canada with 11%. However, as a region, Europe still leads the way with 44%, while Asia Pacific hosts 22% of the ranking companies.

Sporting goods companies Puma and adidas have remained on the list, improving their rankings, from 77 to 47, and from 82 to 66, respectively.

Activewear company Gildan also improved its ranking from 79 to 60, and was the only apparel manufacturing company included on the list globally. While luxury goods company Kering slid down the list from number 12 last year to 31.

Glenn Chamandy, president and CEO of Gildan, said: “We are pleased to be recognised by Corporate Knights’ once more, demonstrating Gildan’s strong commitment to ESG. Our increased ranking reflects our dedication and hard work in developing and advancing our Next Generation ESG strategy over the past year which includes increasing gender diversity, focusing on sustainable investments, employee safety, and linking executive compensation to ESG targets, amongst other initiatives. Under this strategy, we are driving ESG further into our business and remain committed to the path ahead to ensure that our products are made with respect for our people, the environment, and our communities from start to finish.”

Corporate Knights’ 2023 ranking of the world’s 100 most sustainable corporations is based on a rigorous assessment of more than 6,000 public companies with revenue over US$1bn. All companies are scored on applicable metrics relative to their peers, with 50% of the weight assigned to sustainable revenue and sustainable investment. Nine of the indicators have fixed weights; the rest are assigned weights according to each industry’s relative impact in relation to the overall economy. After quantitatively analysing data for 25 key performance indicators, using the Corporate Knights methodology, this year’s overall scores were converted to letter grades.

Ralph Torrie, Corporate Knights’ research director, says rising oil prices have stimulated growth in renewables, smart buildings, electric vehicles and other climate solutions, including circular economy measures. Indeed, the top-ranked company, Schnitzer Steel, is a metals recycler. “Global 100 companies are providing the products and services that are needed for the sustainability transition and that will form the basis of the emerging 21st-century economy,” says Torrie. “They’ve outperformed the market through these last few tumultuous years.”

But while improved productivity scores for carbon, energy, water and other environmental performance indicators are often collateral benefits of underlying megatrends, such as increasing electrification, energy efficiency and digitisation, the improvement in sustainable revenues and investments is generally the result of much more deliberate corporate investment policies and strategic decisions, Torrie says. “Very often, there is visionary leadership from the CEO, and the company has a clear view of the way the world is headed and how to get ahead of it.”","Puma, Adidas improve sustainability rankings in 2023"

A total of 40,000 pairs of discarded sneakers were turned into recyclable materials made of TPU (thermoplastic rubbers) and reborn as nearly 800 square metres of ground cushions, chair cushions and entrance floor mats. Meanwhile, shoelaces were also given a new lease of life and repurposed as goalpost nets in the stadium.

Located in the heart of the Jiang’an River Ecological and Cultural Tourism Belt in the Wuhou district, the new facility known as ‘Adidas No.20 Sports Park’ occupies a floor space of 30,000 square metres. The space comprises of an eleven-aside football field, an eight-aside football field, and Adidas’ first sustainable five-aside football field in the country.

Also installed are facilities such as athletes’ lounge rooms and indoor comprehensive gymnasiums, which will benefit an estimated 36 educational institutions including universities, middle and primary schools within 5 kilometres and surrounding residents too.

The move marks a stride in Adidas’ efforts in acting for the environment, which is in line with the country’s dual carbon ambitions that aim to peak carbon dioxide emissions by 2030, and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. It also adds to the brand’s appeal to the more environmentally conscious cohorts of young consumers who are also their core consumers.

In addition, this is also a shrewd action, tapping into China’s growing interest in football as well as the continued enthusiasm for fitness overall. By rightfully identifying consumers’ interests and leveraging the sports sensation, Adidas can strengthen its relationship with its target audience while consolidating community building, therefore, bringing value to the brand’s sustainable endeavour.

When it comes to the gear you choose to train, there are ways to make what’s good for you, better for the planet. Self-care and caring for the planet can be on equal footing.

Taking strides for the environment, Adidas is helping consumers End Plastic Waste(opens in a new tab) by making their products and processes more sustainable. They’re swapping out virgin materials for recycled ones, creating products that can be remade, and working more closely with nature for inspiration.

Here’s a look at how Adidas is running in the right circles for sustainability.

Turning ocean plastic into polyester

Polyester is the most widely used fiber in the world because it’s durable, versatile, and lightweight, but virgin polyester is not sustainable. The upside? It can be made from recycled plastic and other more planet-friendly alternatives. By 2024, Adidas(opens in a new tab) is switching to recycled polyester wherever possible. Putting this into action already, they use high-performance yarn made from 50% ocean plastic and 50% recycled polyester. Ocean plastic looks terrible on a beach — but great on your feet as sneakers(opens in a new tab).

With apparel and footwear designed to feel comfortable down to your soles(opens in a new tab), now your soul can feel good, too. Adidas is finding new life for worn-out products. Once you’ve had your full run with a product, instead of tossing it in the garbage, scan the Made to Be Remade(opens in a new tab) QR code and send it back to Adidas.

So what better an idea than a service allowing consumers to recycle their clothes without ever having to leave home and help solve a 17-million-ton textile waste problem?

It’s a concept former MAC cosmetics marketing executive Amelia Trumble turned into a business she cofounded in July of 2020 called Retold Recycling, and it drew the attention of the ABC startup game show “Shark Tank.“ Last Friday, the episode featuring Retold Recycling finally aired, affording founders Trumble and Alan Yeoh the chance to exhale under the lifted weight of months-long confidentiality agreements. Of the four sharks, including guest investor Emme Grede of Good American fame, Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban displayed the most interest, and when the dust from the negotiations settled, Cuban and Retold Recycling were business partners, the former getting 25 percent of a stake in the company and the latter $300,000 to invest.

The Retold model follows a fairly familiar concept. For $14.50, or $0.49 less than what ThredUp charges, a customer can request a biodegradable bag capable of holding 5 pounds be delivered to their home, fill it with used clothing and home textiles such as towels and bed sheets, leave it for the mail carrier to ship it back to the nearest of three regional hubs in the continental U.S., and Retold Recycling facilitates the rest.

“There are a lot of companies in this space doing very large volumes of textile recycling,” Trumble, Retold’s CEO, told WWD sister publication Sourcing Journal on Monday. “The thing is that a lot of them are very [business-to-business] focused and they don’t like [dealing with individuals]. We all come from a consumer marketing background, so we’re able to bring that consumer interaction to the landscape, basically.”

All that’s asked of customers, Trumble said, is for the clothes to have been washed.

“It’s really only things that are very soaked in oil or paints…that are problematic,” said Trumble, who pointed out to “Shark Tank” judges that Retold gets roughly $0.10 per pound from its recycling partner. “They all get shipped off to our recycling partners’ depots and they’ll clear items through their own thrift stores. Then it gets put into a sort of marketplace where other companies can buy into the inventory and then they will produce what they need for it.”

The biggest challenge, and one of Cuban’s chief concerns, was the shipping cost associated with carting each bag back to Retold and how it’s such a huge unknown, case by case.

“We don’t know what the volume is of what the customer is going to put inside. They might just put in some panties and socks, or they might put in something quite heavy like a duvet cover,” Trumble said. “So it’s an interesting part of our model that the actual value of that label isn’t triggered until it’s scanned in the postage system.”

Prior to “Shark Tank”, the only seed funding Retold sought was a small friends and family round. The number-one priority for Cuban’s money is to leverage more affordable logistics.

“We have volume through Mark’s network, and through the platform of the show — that gives us greater negotiating power to be able to ship to more hubs,” Trumble said. “The great thing though, is with our model, it’s all based on USPS routes, so everything is sort of like slow freight and gathered in those existing routes. It’s not like we’re adding truck[s] and adding emissions or anything like that; we’re sort of playing into existing networks.” — MATT HICKMAN

NEW DEAL: Major League Soccer and Adidas are continuing their partnership. On Wednesday, the MLS announced a multiyear extension with the athletic company. Under the agreement, Adidas will continue as the official supplier for the MLS, its clubs and youth academies.

According to WWD and FN sister brand Sportico, the deal is a six-year extension that will pay the league $830 million through 2030.

Since 1996, Adidas has been a founding, strategic partner of the professional soccer league in North America, helping it grow its business. Adidas will continue to bolster key development efforts, such as MLS Next Pro and MLS Next, which aims to foster the pro-player pathway from the youth academies through to the MLS.

As part of the renewed, long-term agreement, Adidas will remain the official sponsor, footwear provider and apparel provider, outfitting all clubs with jerseys, shoes, training gear and sideline apparel, as well as the official match ball for all MLS properties.

“It is incredible to see the growth and success of the league and soccer in North America and the work that has been done,” Adidas CEO Bjørn Gulden said in a statement. “Soccer is an important part of our history and who we are at Adidas. We are committed to helping grow the game and could not be more excited as we approach the 2026 World Cup hosted by the U.S., Canada and Mexico.”

MLS commissioner Don Garber added: “Adidas had been helping to drive the popularity of MLS and the sport of soccer in North America for generations and we look forward to working closely with them to accelerate our growth leading into and following the 2026 FIFA World Cup.”

It’s racing season and adidas has recently unveiled new colors of its record-breaking Running lineup.

The Adizero Prime X Strung is relatively new to the market, but it’s quickly gotten rave reviews from runners of all levels. As the first Adizero silhouette to feature a Strung upper, the Prime X Strung delivers a finely-tuned textile informed by athlete data, all without sacrificing comfort and durability. Previous offerings have favored “Pulse Mint” and “Off White” colors, but the latest favors fast “Solar Red” flair.

Underfoot, the long run connoisseur enjoys three layers of Lightstrike Pro foam. Additionally, the cocoon-like upper benefits from the Energyrods housed in-between the cushioning. All together, adidas’ Prime X sole unit makes for a responsive feel that pushes the running industry forward. Lastly, the shoe is made from a minimum of 50% recycled content, an impressive feat considering its unrivaled performance.

Adidas is so confident in its ‘Powerfoyle’ solar charging technology that it ships the Bluetooth RPT-02 SOL headphones without a charging cable.

What could be worse than a charley horse halfway into a run? The answer incessantly beeped in my ear as my wireless earbuds alerted me their time was nigh.

Up to the point, I had a great stride and was cruising on what would be one of my last summer runs. But with my legs outlasting my headphones, that vibe was gone. And I was stuck with the ambient sounds of distant ambulance sirens, nearby road construction, and the “swoo-swee” of my running shorts.

This wasn’t a one-off either. As much as I enjoy running and recreating with music or a podcast, there’s always a chance the battery will die (and having made the jump from corded headphones, I will not go back).

Adidas realized this and this summer offered up a solution: solar-charging headphones. For the last 2 months, I’ve been testing the RPT-02 SOL on-ear headphones.

And in that time, I plugged them to recharge exactly once. The rest of that charge, after near-daily use, came from sunlight. If these seem too good to be true, read on for the full rundown of what I thought.

In short: If you think the idea of wireless Bluetooth headphones that almost never run out of battery sounds like a fallacy, think again. Over the last 8+ weeks of testing, I plugged the RPT-02 SOL in only once to fully recharge. Most of the time, the power drain inside the headphones was either mitigated by sunlight, or the battery actually went up with use. But they aren’t perfect for everything and they come at a high price. So consider these a worthy investment if they match your lifestyle.

adidas RPT-02 SOL Wireless Solar-Charging Headphones Review

I was immediately impressed by these headphones even before putting them on. Opening the box, it was clear adidas wanted to make a big statement — the brand doesn’t even include a charging cable in the package.

That’s right, if these run out of juice, you’d better have a USB-C cable lying around (or wait until morning to use them again). But the message is clear: These really do charge from the sun.

Quick Start

If you’ve used any wireless Bluetooth earbuds or headphones, you’ll probably manage to navigate the RPT-02 SOL intuitively. At the very least, you’ll likely be able to start listening right out of the box.

A control button sits on either side, and these should face backward when worn properly. Your master control rests on the right headphone. This is a “five-way” toggle, so you can press it up, down, left, right, and depress inward.

Up and down control volume, left and right advance or reverse tracks. Pressing the toggle inward controls play/pause, or answers calls.

On the left ear is your “action button.” Despite the name, I rarely used this feature. The button is programmable — sort of — in that you can assign it to play certain Spotify playlists. You cannot assign it to any app you please and, at least in my thorough attempt, it won’t control podcasts.

You can also set this button to perform different functions according to the number of times you press it. So one press will illuminate the built-in light meter to show you how strong the light is. Two presses can launch Spotify, and three will access voice assistant (“call Arlo”).

A quick note on the light meter: I never used this. I figure if I can see the light meter, I can see whether or not it’s bright outside. What’s more, this consists of three concentric rings and is not a precise quantitative measure of the charge — for that, you’ll need the app!

You don’t need to download the corresponding headphones app to use or enjoy the headphones. I didn’t at first, and everything worked fine. But after I downloaded the app and paired the headphones, I recommend you do the same.

The app will allow you to customize your action button, set your equalizer according to your preferences, and most importantly, it will show you the battery level and whether your battery is draining or gaining milliamps.

And on a bright, sunny day, you will actually see your battery going up as you use them — wild!

Great for (Some) Activity

Because I’m accustomed to earbuds that rest within the ear, I questioned how much use I’d get from the on-ear RPT-02 SOL. I am happy to report that these headphones do a pretty good job hanging tough during activity.

For trail runs and jogs about town, they stayed put the vast majority of the time. Yes, a couple of times they started to slide back — but that was easy to fix with a little adjustment (the earphones each slide several notches up and down along the headband — and they can be adjusted individually).

I also wore these on the basketball court and found them OK, but not ideal. For serious high-output activities, these will not prove as stable as good earbuds.

On top of this, the headphones carry IPX4 water resistance. You can’t take them swimming and I wouldn’t recommend wearing them in a soaking rain. But they will stand up to sweat during hot days, no problem.

Fit & Feel

While these headphones remained very stable during testing and proved generally comfortable, I found they wore out their welcome after about an hour. These are not true over-the-ear headphones, in that they sit on your ear, but they don’t cover it.

This isn’t a problem for moderate periods of time, but I can marathon a podcast series while catching up on my weekend honey-do list. So, I noticed pressure points along the middle of my ear and tightness around the sides of my head.

Readjusting the fit and placement helped relieve this somewhat, but it has been the main issue for me in testing.

Tech Specs

For audiophiles and electrical engineers, here are the gritty details.

While I am not an expert on audio or sound, I’ve used my fair share of headphones. The RPT-02 SOL offers rich, balanced sound — and with customizable EQ, I can fine-tune the experience to my preferences. Zero complaints.

Conclusion: Who Should Buy

If you can swing $229 for a pair of headphones, I think you’ll probably be very happy. That said, if you are willing to spend that much, you may have more distinguished audio preferences than I do.

But if the price is right and longevity is of primary concern, I can just about guarantee you’ll love these headphones. I imagine with the onset of winter, I’ll need to be more mindful of recharging these manually.

But with an 80-hour stored runtime and near-infinite charge in summer, it’s a no-brainer for me. The RPT-02 SOL works great for many of my outdoor activities, and so far works better the more I use them.

adidas is putting their best foot forward towards sustainability with its latest ORIGINALS collaboration with Parley, a launch featuring colorful Nizza sneakers and sportswear made from recycled materials.

Ever since Earth Day in 2015, environmental organization Parley for the Oceans has been working with adidas to take bold steps towards protecting the oceans and eliminating potentially harmful waste. Not only has adidas phased out single-use plastic bags and microbeads since then, they’ve also worked with Parley on collections that’ll lessen the impact on our oceans.

adidas has been able to collect plastic waste littering the shorelines and convert them into high-performance running gear and fashionable kicks. In fact, Parley has developed the world’s first supply chain for upcycled marine waste, along with the creation of their “Ocean Plastic” material that adidas now uses in lines like their latest ORIGINALS x Parley collection.

With sun-bleached colors and iconic details, the new Nizza sneakers are a nostalgic throwback to Seventies Southern California skateboard culture. The greener take on adidas’ signature sneaker is comfortable, casual, and you guessed it, made using upcycled plastic waste. This shoe’s upper is made with yarn featuring at least 50% Parley Ocean Plastic which the other 50% is made out of recycled polyester. This “Ocean Plastic” is waste that’s been intercepted on beaches, coastal communities, islands and shorelines that would’ve polluted the surrounding waters.

“Through our collaboration with Parley for the Oceans, we want to inspire and mobilize an entire generation to help shape the future of our planet,” adidas says on their site. “We are empowering athletes worldwide to make a difference. We need action from everyone, everywhere to create true change. We’re on a mission to help end plastic waste, and this is a fight we can’t lose.”

These legendary low top sneakers have been reborn with Mother Nature in mind, but keep all the high-performance design that adidas is known for, including their springy “Boost” midsole and grippy rubber outsole, all sans virgin polyester. More than half of all the polyester in their gear is already recycled, but their new goal is cutting out virgin polyester entirely by 2024.

Want something a little sportier? adidas has already updated their acclaimed Eighties runner faves, the NMD_R1 sneakers that you can feel a little better slipping into. They’re produced with a performance-ready yarn called “Primeblue” meant specifically for training and made with Parley “Ocean Plastic”. We’ve tested the brand’s NMD_R1 sneakers before, and love their soft, stretchy fit and cushioning that gives you an energy boost for longer runs.

With a good mix of classic style and innovative design, the ORIGINALS x Parley adidas collection has made it even easier to get a greener wardrobe. The collection includes Men’s Originals and Youth sizing with prices starting at $65.

This announcement marks an important milestone in SPINNOVA® materials becoming available for consumers globally, Spinnova says.

Eight months after announcing their partnership, Spinnova and adidas have unveiled the first adidas product made with SPINNOVA® fibres.

Spinnova says the adidas TERREX HS1 is a mid-layer knit for hikers that sees adidas exploring a more sustainable textile solution composed of a minimum of 25% wood-based fibres and organic cotton. Working with the material’s natural colour, the hoodie is made without dyeing or bleaching chemicals.

A limited number of the TERREX HS1 will be made commercially available on adidas’ website and in other selected retail outlets with global reach from July.

Spinnova is on a mission to transform the raw material base of the global textile industry.

Commenting on the product launch, Spinnova’s CEO and co-founder Janne Poranen, said: “Spinnova is on a mission to transform the raw material base of the global textile industry by providing radically sustainable and high-performance textile materials.

“We are very proud of the revolutionary results our teams have accomplished together. Today’s launch is a major milestone on our joint commercial journey.”

Spinnova says its first commercial-scale factory is expected to be completed in Finland at the end of this year. Spinnova and its Woodspin joint venture partner Suzano have a scaling target of a million tonnes of global fibre production capacity per annum within the next 10-12 years.

As part of ensuring access to future volumes of SPINNOVA®, adidas became a cornerstone investor in Spinnova’s initial public offering last June.

SPINNOVA® is a circular textile fibre made of sustainably sourced wood, without harmful chemicals. Spinnova says the material produces 65% fewer CO2 emissions and uses 99% less water than cotton production and contains zero microplastics.

Using SPINNOVA® fibres will allow adidas to make high-performance apparel while reducing the CO2 emissions.

Carla Murphy, General Manager of adidas TERREX, commented: “Using SPINNOVA® fibres will allow adidas to make high-performance apparel while reducing the CO2 emissions, water consumption and waste usually required to create such products.

Speaking at this year’s Cannes Lions Changemakers series which shines a light on female leaders making a mark on their industry, Free, the Head of Global Marketing at sportswear multinational Adidas, said brands must evolve their strategies to keep up with the growing expectations younger consumers have of companies.

“We know in our industry, we're part of the problem and we have to be a bigger part of the solution. We focus a lot on Gen Z and they really don't want to hear any more about sustainability,” she told Euronews Next.

Customers will hold companies accountable and as a future-focused brand serving conscious consumers, what you do speaks much louder than what you say, Free noted.

“They want to see action. They want to really see, what are you doing? How are you driving it? They want a longer lasting product and they want it to be better for the planet,” she said.

Putting values into action at Adidas

New consumer behaviours have led to fundamental changes in how one of the top sports companies in the world conducts its business and makes decisions.

Sourcing more environmentally friendly materials, reducing plastic in manufacturing and designing apparel that is more durable, for instance, are just some of the ways Adidas is improving sustainability through product innovation.

“We focus a lot on sustainability. It's a core belief at Adidas to create a stronger planet. When we think about sustainability, there's obviously a message that we want to deliver - but behind the message is the action, Free said.

Not only is the company making more sustainable consumer products, it is working on ways to reduce its carbon footprint internally and co-creating these solutions with customers along the way.

“Consumers want to know: how are you putting your values into action? And so that moves marketing upstream and the way we go about change, the way we build our strategy so that it's not at the end of the cycle, but it's actually at the beginning of the cycle,” she said.

In this sense, the Adidas brand has become much more than a model or aesthetics - it is a holistic representation of the entire company’s values, strategic decisions and purpose.

Diversity is key for brands too

Strong, future focused brands not only strive to put sustainable values into action, they also work on embedding diverse teams that represent the full spectrum of communities they serve.

Whilst the marketing and advertising industry is “late to the party,” Free argues, leaders can work on improving representation by cultivating a strong pipeline of talent in every area of a business.

“How to get to the future faster and that’s with the truth. And today our industry does not reflect the communities that we serve globally. Brands are just made of humans,” she said.

By creating the opportunities for different voices and perspectives to be represented in branding decisions, companies are more likely to better understand and connect to their customers beliefs, values and ultimately commercial choices.

So, how does a company know if it's building a strong, future focused brand? The true indicator is what consumers share voluntarily with others.

“It’s what the community is saying to each other. This tells us who's winning, who's meaningful, and who is truly innovative. And that's what we're focused on,” she said.

Kanye West is yet again a trending topic on Twitter. Adidas/Yeezy employees reported to Rolling Stone that Kanye West played pornographic videos in meetings and showed intimate photos of his ex-wife, Kim Kardashian, during job interviews. Former employees also say West used “mind games” to bully them.

Over two dozen former employees have come forth to admit that the culture in the office was abusive.

Now folks are taking to Twitter to speculate how long Adidas knew about this and allowed it to go on. Many are claiming that West’s behavior was probably excused because of his status. Some are even taking it as far as to say that Adidas may have been aware but swept the entire situation under the rug.

One of the statements in the article comes from an employee hired around the time West first transferred Yeezy from Adidas to Nike (2013). And several more came after this.

All of this information is surfacing just weeks after Adidas cut ties with and ended its shoe partnership with West.

Neither Kanye West nor Adidas has made any statements concerning the allegations yet. So as for now, it is uncertain whether Adidas was aware of these incidents or not.","Kanye West Allegedly Created An Inappropriate Work Environment At Adidas, How Long Did Adidas Allow It?"

It was the latest step in the company's circularity programme, first launched in 2019, which aims to create pieces entirely from one material so they can be ground down and remade into new product after use. There are now 59 products in the collection, which are available to buy on its website. Retail prices ranging from £30 for caps to £220 for running shoes.

Paul Smith, senior director at Adidas' Sustainability Concepts - part of the sportswear retailer's innovation team, and Fabrizio Gallo, senior manager at sustainability strategy, tell Drapers about the company's circularity strategy.

How does Made To Be Remade work?

Paul Smith [In this collection], products are made with a single piece of material. For example, if you’re making performance-running shoes, you have to understand how you could manipulate the same material to create different parts of the product. It’s about thinking from the beginning how to create a product that can be brought back, knowing what can be recycled and being able to close that loop.

We launched Futurecraft.Loop in 2019 [the first experimental running shoes made from 100% reusable TPU, thermoplastic polyurethane, with no glue]. In 2021, we brought the first running shoes, Made To Be Remade Ultraboost to the market. That was a really exciting time to see a real commercial offering of the product.

The range has now expanded – we’ve brought out more clothing products on top of the footwear by adding new products and materials into the collection every season.

What is the mission of this campaign and how are you working with partners and consumers throughout this journey?

Fabrizio Gallo With Made To Be Remade, we’re entering the space of circular economy, which is a system change. We want to evolve from the current linear way of the business to circular. It’s not something that can be done in isolation – you need support from other partners and there have been many challenges along the way.

One challenge, which is also an opportunity, is to constantly look at new materials that we can use for our products and explore new technologies that can be incorporated into the production.

It’s also about how we engage with consumers and explain to them what’s expected from their side, so they can return the products at the end of the product cycle rather than throwing them away. That’s why we've designed a takeback process that is as seamless as possible. By scanning a QR code on the product, consumers can return the products to us, which we can then send to our recycling partners.

What is an achievement you are proud of?

PS It was a big step for us to be able to make the yarn using the same material that we have in the cushioning of the sole [of the Ultraboost running shoes]. The cushioning technology itself was a big step itself but we didn’t know if we could turn that into a yarn to make shoelaces. It’s about removing glues and finding the right stitching thread so the product we make can ultimately be recycled.

FG Another thing was colour. In 2021, we launched the running shoes in natural white and now we also have them in a black colour. It might sound very easy but from a technical perspective, it’s complicated. For example, we need to understand the impact of that on the recycling process, so we have to consider the outcome of mixing black and white shoes, and how that could affect our recycling capacity.

What are the future plans for the campaign?

FG If you look at where we were two years ago, [Futurecraft.Loop] was just a prototype. But now we have a wider range of products from footwear to clothes to serve different consumer needs. I think it’s a success to be able to scale up in such a short amount of time and to bring these products to life in different markets. But we acknowledge that this is just the beginning of a long journey to transition to a circular economy.

PS We will certainly be expanding the programme but it’s also important to connect this with our overall sustainability strategy. So it’s about how we rethink the material that we use in all of our products to move away from fossil fuels. Another example is that in 2019, we said we wanted to remove the use of virgin polyester from our supply chains [by 2024]. In 2021, 91% of our products were already made of recycled polyester, so we’re on track to achieve our goal.",Adidas: built-in circularity with Made To Be Remade

An analyst called the sneaker a ""game changer"" given the industry's addiction to plastic.

Athletic footwear is inherently tough on the environment. Most sneakers are made with pollutants, including plastics and toxic glues.

Eric Liedtke, a former Adidas brand president, who is perhaps best known for launching Kanye West's partnership with the brand nearly a decade ago and before recent controversies, is on a mission to remove those pollutants from apparel.

In December, he unveiled a shoe that won't leave a damaging environmental footprint. In fact, it won't leave any. The shoe sold out, but it was recently restocked.

In 2021, Liedtke cofounded Unless Collective, a Portland, Oregon-based streetwear startup that doesn't use any plastics or polyester. The new shoe, called the Degenerate, will decompose at the end of its useful life.

""It's a first of its kind,"" Liedtke told Insider. ""It's made from the elements to go out into the elements and return to the elements. It's a circular story that I think consumers will really jive on.""

The sneaker solves one of the hardest problems in athletic footwear — creating a shoe that completely biodegrades — and puts pressure on industry giants to ramp up sustainability efforts. Even ""sustainable"" sneakers from brands like Nike tend to include polyester, which is made from plastic. The Degenerate doesn't include any plastic or petrochemicals.

The Unless shoe, which retails for $139, was made in partnership with Natural Fiber Welding, which makes various materials from natural products, including plants and minerals.

""This is a game changer,"" industry analyst and ARCH-USA founder Chris Burns previously told Insider. ""This is a big deal. This looks close to the 'impossible shoe,'"" a reference to an aspirational shoe made entirely with plants and minerals that completely disintegrates and leaves no toxic waste.

The Degenerate includes four of Natural Fiber Welding's materials. While other brands, including Allbirds and Camper, have worked with Natural Fiber Welding, Unless is the first to build a shoe from top to bottom with its materials.

""What's unique about what Eric has done in the footwear industry is paid attention to every single component of the shoe,"" Natural Fiber Welding President Steve Zika previously told Insider.

Zika called the Degenerate, which is available in black and white, a ""revolutionary idea"" because ""the whole shoe is made out of nutrients.""

Last April, Natural Fiber Welding announced an $85 million Series B investment round. Its investors include industry giants such as Ralph Lauren and Allbirds.

Liedtke said the development of the shoe required rethinking every detail of the manufacturing process.

For instance, since the shoe doesn't include glue, it sinks lower into the sole, so it can more easily be sewn together with linen thread. Unless hired cobblers in Northern Italy to do the sewing. And instead of plastic tips for the shoelaces, Unless figured out a way to cross-stitch the ends of the laces.

""Every little thing had to be innovated,"" Liedtke previously told Insider. ""To build a shoe without glue and without an ounce of petrochemicals has been a passion.""

Industry giants, including Nike and Adidas, are working on getting more petroleum-based plastics out of athletic footwear, but it's a challenge because of the durability of plastics.

Burns said the Degenerate could put pressure on other companies, but he said there's still an education gap that needs to be closed.

""The education around sustainability is sorely missing,"" he said. ""No brand is doing enough.""

Style-wise, Burns expects the Degenerate to appeal to consumers because of its chunky sole, which Burns said is on-trend, noting its popularity in shoes like the Jordan Elevate.

""It's perfectly on trend,"" Burns said. ""It looks great.""

Now that the manufacturing process has been worked out, Liedtke said more design flourishes are to come.

""There's 1,000 things we'd like to pursue,"" he said.",How this former Adidas executive is tackling the biggest problem in footwear with biodegradable sneakers

Brands selected are done so for their work championing sustainability best practice in all aspects of their work. Only in its second year, the Laureus Sport for Good Index is a collaboration between Laureus, the global organisation that aims to make green changes using sport as a vehicle, and events company SportsPro.

The index exists “to celebrate brands that align with Laureus’ messages around sustainability and making a difference.”

Rapha’s citation in the index read: “Some of the company’s most impactful work has been carried out by the Rapha Foundation, which was established in 2019 and now funds more than 20 organisations globally that support riders from under-represented communities.

“On top of its charitable efforts, Rapha also has a commitment to be carbon neutral by 2025 and – as a member of the Sustainable Apparel Coalition – is working towards a 45 per cent reduction in collective emissions by 2030.”

Rapha were one of many brands included which, according to SportsPro commercial director Paul Guest, use their position “to drive positive environmental and social progress across the United Nations 17 sustainable development goals”.

Francois Convercey, the new co-managing director of Rapha said that the brand was humbled to make the selection.

“Rapha exists to inspire the world to live life by bike and we're proud to be able to contribute to changing the face of cycling by making it more inclusive, serving underrepresented communities around the world and making our business as sustainable as the sport it serves,"" Convercey said.

""We're humbled to be in the company of many other game-changer brands and hope that together, we will continue to drive a positive impact through sport.""

Last week, Convercey became joint co-managing director of the brand along with another long standing Rapha employee Daniel Blumire.

Newton Heath. But make it neon.

Man Utd unveiled their new third kit for 2022-23, revealing a luminous, never before seen all-over green. Following on from this season's previous releases, adidas look to pay homage to legacy kits of the past while taking a bold step with a fresh design.

For the first time in club history, adidas introduce a striking new interpretation of the classic club colour for an eye-catching all-over 'Solar Slime' jersey. The colour green has long had strong connotations with the history of Man Utd. Still, we've never seen it done like this, and we have seen a lot.

As a club with a strong visual identity, it's no surprise we see a geometric pattern take centre stage both on the collar and the shirt itself. Drawing inspiration from the fashion culture of 90s Zeitgeist, the crewneck collar is dressed in a statement graphic, finishing off the striking design nicely.

Ahead of the release Inigo Turner, Design Director at adidas, spoke of the new kit as ""a convergence of cultural icons remixed and recoded, the 22/23 third kit takes its inspiration from the iconic Manchester United graphic identity, using geometric shapes and patterns.""

Now, the duo looks to adidas Running’s popular Supernova series with the introduction of the Supernova 2.0 Parley.

The silhouette is a product of recycled material and has been designed as part of Adidas' goal of sustainability to help end plastic waste.

The shoe was recently sported by the 2022 FIFA World Cup star, Gvardiol, as he wrapped the forefoot with tape, making adjustments over the laceless boot during his quarter-finals against Brazil.

The shoes can currently be availed on the official e-commerce site of Adidas and select retailers in a couple of sizes. Those interested can look for more sizing options at reseller sites such as Uni Sport Store.

Firm ground boots are essential for the game of soccer, as they have blade-shaped studs which can help you obtain an excellent grip by digging into the ground. Firm ground boots are the most popular in the sport as they are used for well-maintained pitches.

For the FIFA World Cup 2022, the German sportswear giant has extended its X lineage of football boots. The Speedportal boots are movement-focused and the best for multi-dimensional speed. In fact, the X Speedportal boots are sleek and super-comfortable and help players reach their full potential. The official site of the product introduces the pair, saying:

""Good players create time and space. Great ones leave them both behind. Unlock multidimensional speed in adidas X Speedportal. Sleek and super-comfortable, these football boots support instant reactions with a springy, full-length Carbitex carbon plate on their firm ground outsole.""

The football boots come in a laceless style, with the upper being constructed out of PRIMEKNIT material. The shoe includes EVA inserts on the inside of the boot, whereas the lightweight carbon heel locks on the outside sole, which keeps you stable during light-speed play.

The boots' upper features Speedskin 2.0, which is a laceless lightweight upper that guarantees comfort. The textured pattern over the boot helps by securing more direct contact with the ball.

Football boots inculcate a high-speed stability system, with the feature of a support cage and stability wing, which keep your feet locked in, so you can easily opt for dynamic multi-directional movements with absolute freedom.

Lastly, the outsole comes in a speedframe 2.0 design. The frame of the outsole promises acceleration, and when combined with the stud design, it improves traction as well.

Interestingly, the cleats are made with a series of recycled materials, with the upper constructed of at least 50% recycled content. The product represents the three stripe label's solutions to help end plastic waste. Other unique features of the boots include laceless construction, molded midfoot support, and carbon heel lock.

In the recent game between Croatia and Brazil for the Quarter finals on December 9, 2022, the center-back Joško Gvardiol was seen wearing X Speedportal ""Solar Green"" model. For the match, Gvardiol made a small adjustment by wrapping the midfoot in tape, which helped the player increase the lockdown of the foot.

The boots can be availed on the official e-commerce site of Adidas and select retailers at a price of $280.

This is the third article I’ve written over just the last few weeks illuminating the ‘new era of sustainability’ driven by customer values, attitudes and preferences. Previously I discussed the sustainably-minded customer and the need for more transparent ‘green’ messaging form companies.

There is a growing body of evidence that suggests a shift is taking place in the context of sustainability management. Historically, the emphasis in sustainability management has been directed to doing less harm and achieving operational efficiencies. Now the tide is changing. Driven by escalating customer demand, there is a need to direct sustainability efforts toward innovative business models, products and markets that meet the changing needs and expectations of sustainably-minded customers.

For its part, Adidas has made strides to create sustainable products, including using ocean plastics in its shoes and vowing to make nine out of every 10 products sustainable by 2025. The company has also partnered with Allbirds to create shoes with a low carbon footprint. Allbirds uses materials such as merino wool, recycled bottles and cardboard and castor bean oil to manufacture its shoes. Later this summer, Adidas will be releasing its classic Stan Smith shoe using a leather derived from mycelium, the fibrous root structure of mushrooms.

But Adidas is not alone in recognizing and meeting this new sustainability landscape. BASF, for instance, has identified that about one-third of its products analyzed make a specific contribution to sustainability. These ‘Accelerator solutions’ – about 14,000 representing €15 billion in sales in 2019 – can be found in many industries, including health, transportation, construction, consumer goods and others. Schneider, as another example, brings clean energy and energy efficiency solutions to consumers and businesses through its Square D and EcoStruxure product suites. Square D provides consumers a variety of smart home technologies, such as whole-home surge protection, electric vehicle (EV) connectivity, a Qwik-Connect solar inverter and backup panels. EcoStruxure enables enhanced safety, reliability, efficiency, sustainability, and connectivity in businesses by using advancements in IoT, mobility, sensing, cloud, analytics, and cybersecurity.

While addressing operational impacts will continue to be an important aspect of sustainability management, it seems increasingly clear that development of customer-led sustainable products, services, and markets is becoming equally important to demonstrating sustainability leadership.",70% Consumers Want Sustainable Products

ThePackHub Adidas Sneakers Packaged in Shoebox Made from Mushrooms

Streetwear designer Daniel Bailey, also known widely as Mr Bailey, is launching Mr Bailey Adidas Originals Ozlucent sneakers. As part of the product’s radical look, he has chosen to go for a box made from mushrooms, while internally the trainers are encased in an inflated amniotic sac made of sugarcane and cellulose imitating the hood of a jellyfish. The box was designed with the help of research and development studio Black Ink Projects, while England-based Magical Mushroom Company grew and provided the biodegradable mushroom material, which directly replaces EPS (expanded polystyrene). The mushroom packaging is naturally water-resistant and, when broken into smaller pieces, decomposes in the ground within 45 days. It can also be mixed into food waste at the end of its life to be converted into a biogas alternative or electricity or fuel. Alternatively, if the customer wishes to keep the box it is designed to last for 30 years when kept under dry conditions.

NEW YORK, May 26, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Major League Soccer and adidas are once again raising awareness and inspiring action surrounding the impact of marine plastic waste by featuring customized Primeblue uniforms made from a high-performance recycled material and Parley Ocean Plastic™. The jerseys will be worn on field by MLS clubs May 27-29.

Major League Soccer and adidas are raising awareness and inspiring action surrounding the impact of marine plastic waste by featuring customized Primeblue uniforms made from a high-performance recycled material and Parley Ocean Plastic™. Inter Miami CF went underwater to launch their jersey and highlight the beauty of a healthy ocean. From beach clean ups to plastic waste campaigns, members of the soccer community are spreading awareness and taking action to prevent ocean plastic pollution.

Committed to taking steps to address its environmental impact, MLS and adidas' teamed up to create Primeblue jerseys which are made from plastics intercepted from beaches, coastal communities, and shorelines, preventing them from polluting the ocean. Once collected, the original plastic source is reworked into technical fibers that can then be repurposed for use in either apparel or footwear. The high-performance yarn features more than 50% Parley Ocean Plastic™ on each jersey.

""Major League Soccer is committed to reducing our carbon footprint and raising awareness about environmental issues, including plastic waste on land and in water,"" said JoAnn Neale, MLS' President and Chief Administrative Officer. ""We are thrilled to have an innovative partner like adidas that enables our clubs to sport kits that inspire the soccer community to join together to preserve our ocean and create a cleaner world.""

MLS also teamed up with We Are Social New York, a global socially-led creative agency, to develop content that sheds light on the effects of plastic waste in our oceans. Photographer Eric White brought a crew together to participate in a cleanup at Great Kills beach in Staten Island while showcasing the Primeblue jerseys. The event highlighted how even a small group can take big steps towards creating a more sustainable future. Visit MLSsoccer.com to view the content.

In addition to Primeblue jerseys being worn on field by clubs throughout the weekend's matches, many MLS clubs have made efforts in their local communities to create sustainable projects and educate people on the harmful impact of marine plastic pollution. From beach clean ups to plastic waste campaigns, the activations build off MLS WORKS' Greener Goals initiative which raises awareness about environmental issues in the soccer community. MLS WORKS is the League's social responsibility platform.

The club is in the midst of its first ever Sustainability Week, , where they are educating fans on their solar power, compost efforts and more. The week culminates with the club sporting Primeblue jerseys on field. Seattle Sounders FC – Seattle Sounders FC is proud to be the first carbon neutral professional soccer club in North America and the first carbon neutral pro sports team in the United States . The club hosted a day of service on May 21 to help clear trash and clean neighborhoods. The efforts support the club's long-term goals of Protect our Planet by ensuring they divert waste from our waterways, and to Fight Racism by using our platform to support BIPOC neighborhoods and small businesses.

Earlier this year, select MLS clubs and adidas teamed up on a sustainability initiative to help keep plastic waste out of landfills. As part of the program, nine games were hosted where fans were given a reusable tote and a separate mailer to take home and fill with donations to send to the adidas Give Back program. The Give Back program accepts gently used clothes and shoes from any brand and rewards participants with adiClub points and vouchers to use on adidas.com. In addition to these 9 games, the Colorado Rapids hosted a Sustainability game on April 23 where they collected over 2,000 gently used items from fans. These items were donated to local charities.

The 2022 Primeblue jerseys for all clubs will be available starting today for purchase at MLSstore.com and at team stadium stores. For more information, visit MLSsoccer.com.

It is striving to be a leading figure in a more sustainable future.

Part of this launch involved Jess Fox, Ian Thorpe, Nathan Cleary, and Steph Claire Smith debuting a sustainable floating tennis court composed of ocean plastic at the 2022 Australian Open. Adidas made the floating court also to raise awareness about marine plastic pollution.

The athletes played tennis on the marine barge along the Great Barrier Reef to draw attention to the importance of ocean cleanup and pollution prevention.

After the event, the tennis court was repurposed into a sports court and donated to a Townsville school. The firm wishes to inspire schoolchildren to unite through athletics and create a more sustainable world.

Ian Thorpe, an Adidas ambassador, and swimmer said he’s proud to be a partner in this cause. He said:

“The design of the new Adidas tennis range made with Parley Ocean Plastic is inspired by the Great Barrier Reef, so it was appropriately launched in the stunning heritage-protected Queensland marine park today to raise awareness and positive discussion around how we can help end plastic waste. It was a day that none of us will ever forget. Plastic is a problem that has reached unfathomable proportions: unless we change course, there will be more plastic waste in the sea than fish by 2050. This waste is destroying the oceans.”

It is hoped that the floating event will spark a good dialogue about the necessity of eliminating plastic waste and protecting the oceans from further degradation.

Shannon Morgan, Senior Director of Brand at Adidas Pacific, commented on the new collection:

“At Adidas, we believe through sport we have the power to change lives. We live this purpose every day by looking at all possibilities to include and unite people in sport to help create a more sustainable world. We need to continue to implement sustainable solutions now so that we can help create a new era of sport for future generations. We are committed to helping end plastic waste, and by 2024, we will replace virgin polyester in our products with recycled polyester wherever possible. To achieve these goals, we foster open-source partnerships and put a high value on collaboration over the competition to create sustainable solutions that go beyond our own business and influence.”

In recent years, Australia has seen a slew of climate change-related natural disasters, including bushfires, ozone layer depletion, and the continued contamination of single-use plastic, which has contributed to the Great Barrier Reef’s destruction. Rising global emissions is the other Great Barrier Reef destroyer; they cause global warming, which causes ocean temperatures to rise, resulting in mass bleaching events.

So, launching this collection and hosting the floating tennis court in Australia seems natural. This way, the country not only sees the effects of environmental deterioration but also the possibility of recovery.",Adidas Creates Floating Tennis Court Made of Ocean Plastic to Raise Awareness

And with those hopes may also come the desire to find hiking footwear suited for all-day weekend excursions into the woods. The ideal hiking shoes are light enough not to tire the feet after a few hours of traversing rocks, sands, and the innumerable surfaces across a trail, waterproof, offer a confident grip, and preferably look great while doing it. The adidas TERREX Free Hiker 2 is designed to check off all these marks.

The adidas TERREX Free Hiker 2’s footstrike ride is cushioned and almost airy, a characteristic credited to the Boost technology on which the hikers ride upon for an energy return feel that should add at least a few more miles without having to succumb to fatigue.

adidas has also given the Free Hiker 2’s a grippy traction outsole constructed with Continental rubber. When tested, the abrasion-resistance reinforcements and a molded toe cap design across a local trail with slippery rocks and dusty clay paths local to our area did well to maintain its composure switching between dry and wet surfaces, agile and lightweight.

While climbing around a small canyon dam over the weekend, we were also able to test out the weatherproof and breathable waterproof Gore-Tex membrane version. The adidas TERREX Free Hiker 2 aren’t really intended for deep backwoods hiking, but for a creek crossing pair of kicks or summit-reaching day trips, they’ll keep your feet dry and less fatigued.

We recommend the Free Hiker 2 for those who prefer hiking footwear with a more cushioned and lightweight feel. The TERREX Free Hiker 2 (above) and Free Hiker 2 Gore-Tex (below) silhouettes are available now for $200 and $230 respectively. Note the Free Hiker 2’s more sock-like design, with the Gore-Tex iteration adopting a more boot-like structure to keep water from soaking socks and feet.

The collection includes technical outdoor footwear to tackle all terrains with an adidas by Stella McCartney first – the Hika Sandal, made in part with sugarcane

A vessel for self-expression and activism, key pieces in the collection share Stella McCartney's manifesto to celebrate the quest of the next generation Dropping 16th February, the Spring/Summer 2023 TrueNature collection blends high-fashion, performance, and protection to explore new possibilities in nature

Today, adidas by Stella McCartney unveils its Spring/Summer 2023 TrueNature collection. The drop blends unique satellite prints with high-performance technologies that have been crafted from natural pigments and fabrics, designed for exploring the world outside.

Paying homage to the great outdoors, the new collection provides a distinct embodiment of the vastness and beauty of nature from above. Hero pieces capture a contemporary take on Earth and weather satellite images, alongside conceptual contours, and ley lines of maps. Available in bold hues of blue and green to mirror the natural landscape, the tactical silhouettes can be layered for versatility and freedom to move outside.

Giving a voice to the next generation, key pieces in the capsule are also adorned with a typography print featuring wording from the adidas by Stella McCartney manifesto. With phrases including 'not a reset, but a restart' and 'no compromise', the design symbolises the next generation's quest and is inspired by the contrast between graphic lettering and ocean weather prints – as seen on the Scuba Shorts.

With leading technologies such as Parley Ocean Plastic and WIND.RDY, the collection has been crafted to protect the next generation of active activists. Key pieces include the Hika sandal, adidas by Stella McCartney's first-ever sandal made with natural and renewable materials, and the reimagined Seeulator – designed with a water-repellent textile upper to keep feet warm and dry while exploring. A range of pieces are also available in inclusive sizing, including the graphic sweatshirt, sweatpants, and running tights.

Exploring new possibilities for performance wear, each piece in the collection has been made in part with recycled materials as part of adidas' ambition to help end plastic waste

Speaking about the SS23 TrueNature collection, Stella McCartney said:

“Connection to nature is an important part of my life and work, which is why the TrueNature collection is so special to me. When crafting this drop, we wanted it to embody the freedom and natural highs you feel when immersed in nature and symbolise how a different point of view can be so captivating. I'm also thrilled to introduce our first-ever Hika sandal, which will be core to all summer expeditions. It is this type of unique technical style that makes our collaboration so fresh and exciting – together, we continue to push the boundaries of sport style season after season.”

Key pieces from the drop include:

TrueNature Scuba Shorts:

A tight fit and easy look make the Scuba Shorts a stylish yet comfortable option. Paired with a cosy sweatshirt or windbreaker, they are the perfect counterpoint to oversized style - or a cropped tee. A gradient of color catches the eye with the all-over typography print for a look that provides an all-day, effortlessly cool look.

Hika Sandal:

adidas by Stella McCartney's first-ever sandal is made with natural and renewable materials, including a midsole crafted from 50% BIO EVA from sugarcane – part of adidas' journey to design out finite resources and help end plastic waste. Protective and functional, the sandals can be easily slipped on and keep wearers comfortable no matter the adventure.

Seeulator:

Reintroducing an adidas staple, the Seeulator shoe features a sock upper constructed from Primeknit technology and contrasting leather overlays for a fusion of performance, style, and protection. Upper is made with at least 25% recycled materials, the shoe is designed with a water-repellent textile upper – keeping feet warm and dry while exploring in cold conditions.

TrueNature All-In-One:

Designed with adidas' WIND.RDY fabric, the all-in-one keeps wearers warm while still providing breathability. With reflective lines along the body and legs as well as a half zip design for easy wear, this running all-in-one is ideal for exploring and embracing nature in style. It is made from 100% recycled polyester and features a back pocket perfect for storing away any small belongings.

TruePace High Support Sports Bra:

From hiking outdoors to the most intense HIIT classes, this sports bra is designed to help wearers move with confidence. The high-support bra features swan hooks on the elastic chest band and adjustable straps allowing wearers to customise the fit and shape exactly how they want it. Made of smooth, slick fabric that feels cool to the touch.

Liedtke recently cofounded Unless Collective, which makes plant-based streetwear.

The brand aims to be a ""lighthouse"" that convinces others to rethink their environmental footprint.

Eric Liedtke did a little bit of everything for Adidas over his 26-year tenure, from working in the mail room to becoming Adidas brand president and earning a spot on the company's board.

He worked closely with Adidas endorsers Ye, Beyoncé, and Pharrell Williams and spoke at the United Nations about an Adidas sneaker made from trash recovered from the ocean. He also helped develop the company's 2020 business plan.

Liedtke was a popular pick to become the next CEO of Adidas. But at the end of 2019, he moved from Germany back home to Oregon to start a more sustainable retail brand.

In 2021, Liedtke, and four other Adidas veterans, Paul Gaudio, Tara Moss, Milos Ribic, and Maarten Teijsse, launched Unless Collective, a Portland-based streetwear brand that makes clothing from plants. The brand recently opened its first store, a 400-square-foot temporary location in downtown Portland, across from the famed Powell's Books.

Liedtke's goal is to do for sportswear and streetwear what Tesla did for cars.

""We want to be a lighthouse brand for others to follow,"" Liedtke told Insider in an interview at the new store. ""This industry needs a Tesla-like moment.""

""Before Tesla came along, if you wanted an electric car, you had to buy a smart car,"" he said. ""You made the consumer sacrifice their taste. You made them sacrifice what they wanted in speed and quality and comfort. You have to meet people where they are with better solutions.""

Liedtke said his decision to start his own brand came after concluding that big brands are limited when it comes to their sustainability efforts.

""I took it as far as I could at an incumbent. The problem with incumbents is they're complicit in make-take-throw away,"" he said, referring to fast-fashion trends where brands make products that consumers ultimately discard, creating waste. ""Their fiduciary responsibilities get in the way of being able to pivot to a better feedstock because of the cost involved.""

No 'forever materials'

While companies like Adidas and Nike have pledged to use more recycled polyester this decade, Liedtke said Unless Collective doesn't use any polyester in its products.

Polyester is a plastic typically derived from petroleum. It's a staple of athletic footwear and apparel because it's lightweight, durable, and versatile.

For Liedtke, even recycled polyester is still a ""forever material"" because it takes significantly longer to decompose than natural materials.

""Recycled polyester is akin to driving a hybrid car,"" he said. ""It's kinda like this half step, but you still need to solve the problem of waste.""

Instead of recycled materials, Unless Collective uses plant-based materials, mostly cotton. Corozo nuts make up the buttons on jackets. The goal is ""zero harmful waste"" in any product. T-shirts start at $45. Hoodies and jackets start at $99 and $149, respectively.

Everything is designed to be compostable. There's even a glass box in Unless Collective's retail store that holds a rapidly decomposing hoodie.

""We start with the end in mind,"" Liedtke said.

At end-of-life, a tag sewn inside each Unless Collective product gives directions on how to return it. The company's working with an industrial composter in California that can make ""nutrient rich soil"" out of the company's old hoodies and T-shirts.

'Moving toward the upper right-hand corner of your whiteboard'

Unless Collective started as a direct-to-consumer brand, but like other retail startups, it's pivoting to include wholesale. It's already on shelves at Social Status, a trend-setting boutique.

So far, Liedtke said Unless Collective's story is a winner with consumers. After an episode of the ""How I Built This"" podcast with Guy Raz about Unless Collective recently re-aired, orders spiked the next day, which Liedtke said is common when people first hear about the company and its mission.

""We picked and packed over a hundred orders yesterday,"" he said. ""We were packing boxes all day. I've driven more transport trucks in my last year than I have in the last 10 years. I feel like a college kid with all the moving around.""

Like other plant-based apparel companies, Unless Collective has had to completely rethink its supply chain. Contract factories that make streetwear and sportswear apparel aren't used to working with plant-based materials. For instance, polyester thread is easier to work with than cotton.

Instead of relying on factories in Asia, Unless Collective manufactures its jackets in Portugal, its T-shirts in the Carolinas in the US, and its hoodies in Los Angeles.

In some cases, Unless Collective is working to get a ""minimum viable product"" on the market in order to keep the company moving forward. In December, the company unveiled its first sneaker.

""I believe in moving toward the upper right-hand corner of your whiteboard,"" Liedtke said.

Just don't expect anything like a Jordan or an Air Force 1. Large companies make performance-athletic shoes with leather, polyester, and glue. Unless Collective will make its shoes with plants and minerals, making them less durable, but more sustainable, than a typical sneaker.

""Will it adhere to the standards that we are used to in a Nike, or Adidas, or Doc Martens? Maybe not,"" he said. ""But let's get it on consumers' feet and let the consumer decide.""

Liedtke said his decades of experience continues to open doors, including with venture capitalists who provided $7.5 million in early funding. Three collaborations, which are critical to creating buzz, are in the works, he said. Liedtke declined to share names or brands.

""I know somebody at every major brand,"" he said. After nearly three decades in an industry ""your network is an unfair advantage.""",How streetwear brand Unless Collective aims to accomplish what brands like Nike and Adidas haven't — fully sustainable sneakers and apparel

The launch also coincides with the release of two white papers produced by Aalto University, which explore circular business models and share an overview of the New Cotton ecosystem blueprint.

The New Cotton Project has reached the two-year point in its three-year project. The final stage of the collaboration will focus on continued data collection, further academic papers from Aalto University and the Life Cycle Assessment, all of which will be shared with the wider industry with the aim of inspiring further circular initiatives in the future.

The New Cotton Project believes the fashion industry urgently needs scalable circular solutions, yet it says the creation of circular materials to decrease dependency on virgin material has historically proven challenging, with a truckload of textiles being landfilled or burned every second.

The New Cotton Project was introduced to answer this challenge and aims to demonstrate a potential blueprint for commercial circular garment production, and a new more sustainable way of working for the fashion industry.

The New Cotton Project highlights the adidas by Stella McCartney Sportswear Tracksuit Viscose (Gender Neutral) and H&M Group’s utilitarian jacket and trousers were created using a new, high-quality Infinna fibre made from post-consumer end-of-use textiles.

The organisation believes both garments demonstrate a potential for a circular garment eco-system, and highlights the industry’s ability to move from a linear to a circular model of production.

Fashion for Good’s recent Sorting for Circularity report, which was published in September 2022 suggests up to a quarter of European post-consumer textiles could become textile-to-textile recycling feedstocks in the future. This includes the 494,000 tonnes of low-value post-consumer textiles identified as readily available for fibre-to-fibre recycling.

The New Cotton Project explains an estimate of how much is likely to be a fit for Infinna technology will be available later on in the project.

Earlier in July, the consortium celebrated the successful implementation of the entire value chain from textile sorting to the production of garment samples.","New Cotton Project celebrates H&M, Adidas large-scale circular fashion launches"

The items—an Adidas by Stella McCartney tracksuit and an H&M jacket-and-trouser combo—are not just “beautiful pieces of clothing” made from post-consumer recycled man-made cellulosic fiber, according to the New Cotton Project, but they’re also proof that the fashion industry is able to move away from the take-make-dispose model of production.

Their debut as part of an installation at the Fashion for Good Museum in Amsterdam coincides with the release of two white papers by Aalto University, one exploring the potential of circular business models and the other presenting a blueprint of the “ecosystem” of brands, manufacturers, innovators and researchers that made everything possible.

This is another milestone for the three-year initiative, now at its mid-way point, after beginning in 2020 with the idea that circularity had to be a radically collaborative effort in order to succeed. Current data suggests up to one-quarter of European post-consumer textiles could become fodder for new fiber production.

“The New Cotton Project might not be the ultimate solution to all of the sector’s ailments, but it represents an initial step toward it as the project is an attempt to bring a technical experiment into a commercial-scale experience through a partnership between 12 partners,” Aalto University researchers Natalia Moreira and Kirsi Niinimäki wrote in one of the papers. “This industrial collaboration and partnership place all of its members at the same level and collaboratively tries to find common grounds to reach the final endeavor.”

Members of the consortium include REvolve Waste, which provided data and insights through textile-waste mapping; Frankenhuis, which prepared post-consumer textile streams as feedstock for chemical recycling; and Xamk, a scientific institute that optimized a pre-treatment process for the collected textiles. Infinited Fiber Company pumped out the fiber known as Infinna, which Inovafil, Kipas and Tekstina spun and dyed into yarn and woven textiles. Adidas and H&M handled design and manufacturing, while Aalto University, Fashion for Good and Research Institutes of Sweden, better known as RISE, continue to be on the frontlines of analysis and communications.

The project’s first 18 months, Moreira and Niinimäki wrote, surfaced several “unforeseen difficulties,” from moving textile waste between countries to challenges implementing large-scale machinery to process fibers. Another issue, due to the unpredictability of the feedstock, was the development of “market-oriented” collections with high potential for color variation between lots. Non-cellulosic inputs were another barrier: the recycling process, stakeholders found, was unable to accept more than 12 percent of non-cellulosic fibers, though this number could increase as Infinited Fiber Company hones its technology. This also meant that the pieces that Adidas and H&M designed had to be assembled using threads and trims made with cotton and other cellulosics. While all of these led to production delays and quantity compromises, ultimately the project prevailed through its “innovative” business model, which allowed companies of all sizes to “embrace sustainable practices together through shared risk.”

“Built on the same principles of a natural ecosystem, a circular ecosystem is being proposed to generate a similar balance throughout the supply chain,” Moreira and Niinimäk said. “This is important because it promotes communication and cooperation between various business associates in this long-term partnership.”

The “final stage” of the New Cotton Project will focus on continued data collection, further academic papers and a life-cycle assessment, all of which will be shared with the wider industry in the spirit of transparency, open knowledge and, most important, change.

“Now it is time to challenge the current business logic and construct new business models which can enhance a new kind of sustainability transition,” the researchers wrote in the white paper about alternatives to linear business models. “Sustainable growth and embracing circularity are ever so important for the environment, the consumer, the supply chain and the workers. Learning more about the topic, promoting change and proposing new ventures can help lessen the remaining distance within the industry and lead to more transparency and satisfaction for all parties involved.”",Adidas and H&M’s Circular Fashion Debut is 18 Months in the Making

“They will be the first to be produced through a collaborative consortium dedicated to demonstrating the potential of a circular model for commercial garment production, testing a new, innovative and more sustainable way of working,” the three-year New Cotton Project, which began in 2020, said in a mid-way point update this week.

With the cooperation of its 12 partners, the process of sorting, managing and then recycling cellulose-rich materials, has become a well-oiled machine.

Tasked with managing the textiles sorting and mechanical processing phase of the project, Frankenhuis analyzes the fabric composition of the collected materials to identify the correct feedstock for Infinited Fiber Company. It’s supported by REvolve Waste, whose ongoing remit is to map the location and content of textile waste across Europe.

Xamk, a scientific institute, has optimized a pre-treatment process for the collected textiles. Infinited Fiber Company, which is building a commercial-scale factory in Finland, works its magic to create Infinna, a regenerated man-made cellulosic fiber that has also won buy-ins from Ganni, Pangaia and Zara. The recipients of this bounty are manufacturers Kipas, Inovafil and Tekstina, which test, produce and dye the resulting high-value yarns and fabrics.

Now that they have successfully tested and developed styles made with Infinna, Adidas and H&M are gearing up for commercial production. Infinna, which the New Cotton Project said “looks and feels just like virgin cotton,” will infuse “pioneering pieces” by the two nameplate retailers this fall/winter, offering a proof of concept for truly circular fashion.

But challenges abound before more recyclable garments can become a broader reality. One stumbling block? Attitudes. A survey conducted by Adidas across three key markets revealed a continued “lack of understanding” around circularity as it relates to textiles, underscoring a need for greater consumer education.

There are bright spots, however. More than half of respondents said they want to engage with brand-independent take-back schemes. This includes returning clothing and footwear featured in the sportswear giant’s Made to Be Remade lineup, which is designed to be shredded and reconstituted into a “new generation” of products.

The survey also uncovered an overall positive perception of recycled fabrics, including a willingness among those polled to accept variations in recycled fabrics. This suggests that a “larger offer of recycled clothing will be well received in the market,” the New Cotton Project said.

Since sorting for recycling is critical to unlocking circularity within the industry, limitations in fiber-identification technologies and the lack of a unified system to allow more consistent feedstocks are stymying progress. Mandatory reporting requirements for fiber composition in garments can also help reliably assess material recyclability, it said.

Also important is designing for circularity and end-of-life solutions in the first place. Because the recyclability of a garment is determined at the design phase, elastane use, multiple layers of different textiles and unnecessary fiber blends must be minimized.

Then there is the need for “new ways” of communicating and working throughout the value chain, the New Cotton Project said. A key to success, it stressed, is closer collaboration among designers, sorting facilities and recycling technologies.

As a “test and learn process,” the New Cotton Project has incorporated the learnings it has gleaned thus far to “highly positive results.” And whatever the future holds, the two capsules are undoubtedly a milestone, it noted. So far only 1 percent of clothing produced worldwide is recycled into new ones, according to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation.

“This is an important step as we strive toward a system change in the way we produce and consume fashion,” the New Cotton Project said. “Moreover, this project should hopefully serve to inspire other industry players to drive and adopt circular practices of their own.”

As it moves into its back half, the New Cotton Project will continue to home its attention on data collection and analysis to “highlight relevant insights for the industry,” it said. The results, which will include a “blueprint of the circular ecosystem” from Aalto University, will be disseminated by innovation platform Fashion for Good. RISE Research Institutes of Sweden will develop a life-cycle assessment, ”identifying progress opportunities to further develop the concept.“","Adidas, H&M’s Circular Fashion Pilot Clears Key Milestone"

Not only does the industry have a large carbon footprint, but many of the materials it uses are damaging for ocean environments. Sustainability has become a key concern for conscious consumers, and this has been having a knock-on effect on brands. Adidas has already made efforts to address its environmental impact by using recycled PET plastic in its products, and now it has made another step forward by releasing its first totally recyclable shoe.

The shoe was launched as part of Adidas’ recent Ultraboost release that was timed to coincide with Earth Week and is called Made to be Remade. The idea behind the sneaker is that it forms part of a circular economy. It’s made with materials and technology that enable the shoes to be returned to Adidas at the end of their life, after which they will be remade into a new pair of shoes or product, hence the Made to be Remade moniker.

The way in which the shoes are returned to Adidas is actually pretty nifty — on the tongue of each pair there is a QR code. When scanned with a smartphone, it launches a digital experience where the return process can be accessed and managed.

Adidas is touting these shoes as part of its continued efforts to bring an end to plastic waste and reduce the plastic pollution of the oceans. It also has an ongoing collaboration with Parley where it uses reclaimed ocean plastic in the shoe design.

While Adidas should be given a level of respect for making efforts to bring a level of responsibility to the manufacture of its shoes, we would like to see this same approach applied to all of its products. Rather than just enabling one type of shoes to be remade as part of a circular economy, it would be revolutionary if all of its shoes offered the same experience. Let’s hope this is the way of the future, and that Adidas is leading the charge.

Through an upcycling partnership with Oregon’s The Renewal Workshop (TRW), the athletic brand aims to refresh and repair used and unsalable goods from its Terrex outdoor collection. Adidas will leverage TRW’s expertise in creating the “Nothing Left Behind” limited-edition line that extends the life of its products, similar to how Arc’teryx sold refurbished archival pieces on Grailed last year.

TRW, which works with The North Face, Tommy Hilfiger, Champion, H&M’s Cos and Coyuchi, revamps used apparel and creates upcycled materials and recycling feedstock from discarded apparel and textiles, on the premise that 82 percent of the items destined for the trash can actually be reused and re-sold. This week, the six-year-old company was purchased by U.K. supply chain management firm, Bleckmann, a sign of growing interest in sustainable fashion business models.

The Adidas collection aims to attract consumers with unique pieces created through innovative design. The partnership also represents a step toward discovering scalable solutions that keep Adidas goods out of landfills.

“We continually challenge ourselves to develop pieces that can extend the lifespan of Terrex products nearing the end of their lifecycle,” Michael Kadous, head of Adidas Terrex and Five Ten in North America, said in a statement. This goal was the “guiding inspiration” for the brand’s designers as they worked on the TRW capsule.

“The result is a reimagined collection sourced from athletes and employees,” he added. The one-of-a-kind, re-engineered outdoor pieces will enable athletes “to tell stories about all new adventures born from their repurposed pieces.”

Kadous said the used apparel was sourced from Adidas Terrex sponsored athletes like pro climbers Molly Mitchell and John Cardwell, as well as the company’s employees. Revamped pieces from the capsule collection will be given back to their original owners, and will not be available for sale, he said, but a successful proof of concept will drive the company’s future-facing strategy for upcycling and repurposing apparel.

“As a designer, it was such an eye opener of how can we set things up for a longer life at the beginning, at the start,” said Ashley Anson, Adidas senior design director. “That’s something that I never consider when designing, and something that I will continue to do going forward.”

Working through concepts on a smaller collection helped to highlight possibilities for the breadth of the brand’s product assortment. “We cut styles apart that we really weren’t able to repair, and we created this really fun collection that has a lot of visual to it,” she added.

“A lot of the design community is so passionate about the future of what Adidas can do when it comes to sustainability,” senior designer Kenna Smith said. “I think it would be really great if we took our partnership with The Renewal Workshop to the next level, and really built a program that is made to last.”

Smith said such an effort would bolster consumer confidence, “seeing that Adidas is really truly committed to sustainability beyond just recycled materials.”

An Adidas raffle will enable one AdiClub member to win a custom piece from the collection. In the near term, consumers interested in finding a responsible solution for their used Adidas apparel can return it through the brand’s Give Back program. In exchange for membership points or reward vouchers, AdiClub members can return their old garments to Adidas to be re-sold or reused.

Meanewhile, TRW co-CEO and co-founder Nicole Basset said the acquisition by Bleckmann will help the startup “scale renewal and re-commerce for the industry.”

“The potential for renewal to make a meaningful difference in the climate crisis is real,” she added, pointing to internal research finding that renewing existing products versus producing new ones can slash carbon emissions in half. Bleckmann’s clientele in fashion, lifestyles and electronics makes the company “the ideal partner to help every brand committed to sustainability achieve their goals,” Basset said.

The acquisition gives TRW greater exposure to Europe, where it opened an Amsterdam repair and reconditioning facility in two years ago. TRW co-founding co-CEO Jeff Denby said Bleckmann’s international reach makes it the “perfect” partner to innovate in renewal. “With their global footprint, they can build on what we started in Europe and the U.S.,” he said.

TRW’s operational framework for recycling, repair and e-commerce fulfillment will add to Bleckmann’s current returns management solutions and enhance the service portfolio to help fashion clients deal with the high volume of unsalable returns they receive each year.

“Returns management is a significant business issue for clients, both financially and environmentally,” Jurrie-Jan Tap, Bleckmann chief business development officer, said. Combining TRW’s services with Bleckmann’s expertise will give customers a “new, advanced way of managing returns, leading to higher added value for all parties involved, including the end-consumers.”

“By increasing the percentage of merchandise redirected to re-commerce channels or repurposed by upcycling and recycling, we all build towards a better circular tomorrow,” he added.",Adidas’ Circular Experiment Revives Outdoor Terrex Gear

They would be put through two days of detailed presentations on current and future programs as well as market and strategy. When the event was over, notebooks were full of material sufficient for several in-depth stories.

But when the aircraft manufacturer hosted its “Airbus Summit” Nov. 30-Dec. 1 in Toulouse and Munich, the contrast could not have been greater. The OEM presented a highly orchestrated multimedia show for more than 100 journalists and influencers, with many more participating online. Videos, sound and light effects, professional stage decoration and a detailed script were used to push a specific message.

OEM may delay ZEROe service entry if infrastructure lags behind

New concerns about hydrogen leakage emerge

That message, and the reason Airbus put in such an effort in the first place, was all too obvious: The pressure on the aerospace industry to do more to improve its environmental credentials is intense and likely will only increase. And Airbus is trying to position itself as the driver of the sector’s sustainability efforts, which it may be in some respects.

When the message runs up against reality, things get a little more complicated. Boeing is not in a position to launch any major development program that would result in a more efficient aircraft—likely for some years. Because of that, Airbus has no competitive incentive to move ahead on its own, and engine manufacturers have nowhere to put any new powerplants for the time being. And all of this is holding back any near-term leaps forward.

Most initiatives the sector is launching will likely have medium-term effects at best. Airbus’ signature project, the ZEROe hydrogen aircraft, is not likely to have a material effect on the sector’s carbon emissions for many decades. Whether the most promising roads ahead are instead sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) and hydrogen is largely dependent on progress in other industries—and political decisions.

Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury warned at the summit that things are not moving fast enough. “Ambition is not yet matched by action,” Faury said. “But the clock is ticking. It is difficult to overstate the scale of the energy challenge. The time for excuses is over, the time for action is now.” He indicated, for the first time, that uncertainty about hydrogen supply “could be a reason to delay the launch of the program, even if the technologies for the aircraft are ready.

“I am impressed by how this sector has come together, but overall it is a mixed picture,” Faury said. But he stated that “we need to have 10% of SAF by 2030.” The European Union mandate is for just 5%—and substantially less than 1% of global fuel consumption that is currently covered by SAF. Airbus aircraft are certified for 50% SAF use, with the OEM aiming at certification of 100% SAF by 2030. “We will be leading by example . . . [by investing] our own money,” Faury said.

Much of that money, along with ample French and German public research funds, is flowing into ZEROe. Airbus began by studying three different concepts: a regional aircraft, a narrowbody and a blended wing body. But Glenn Llewellyn, Airbus’ vice president for zero-emission aircraft, all but ruled out the blended wing body. Changing the propulsion system and the basic configuration of the aircraft in one single step would be “too much,” in his opinion. Instead, Airbus is aiming for a classic tube-and-wing concept “with a very different propulsion system,” he said at the summit.

Airbus is leaning toward handling hydrogen storage by putting two tanks behind the pressure bulkhead in the rear of the fuselage. Llewellyn warned that hydrogen aircraft are likely to be more expensive to operate than the cost levels airlines are used to today. “But not disruptively so,” he said. Airbus’ move to explore fuel-cell technology for ZEROe is also strategically relevant for engine manufacturers, and it can no longer be assumed that they are automatically onboard for the project. “But we could easily decide to partner on the engine,” Llewellyn said. Whether Airbus will go with fuel cells or direct hydrogen combustion is a decision for later. “We are not at that stage yet,” Llewellyn said.

Fred Krupp, president of the Environmental Defense Fund, is not even at the stage of wholeheartedly supporting hydrogen-powered aircraft. “Hydrogen can be a good thing, but not necessarily,” he said at the summit. In particular, he pointed to the emerging problem of hydrogen leakage, as well as the lack of standards for both hydrogen and SAF. “We have to make sure that SAF and hydrogen are steps forward, not backward.” He urged the industry to pay attention to the details, which may dictate the initiatives’ success or failure.

“Neither Airbus nor any other company has any equipment to measure [leakage],” Krupp said. But it should be investigated sooner rather than later. Hydrogen is not a greenhouse gas (GHG) itself but does have an indirect climate impact. The water vapor it helps create can form cirrus clouds, which increase global warming.

Moreover, to create water vapor, hydrogen combines with hydroxyl radicals that would otherwise react with methane—which is a GHG—and destroy it, Krupp said. The indirect greenhouse effect of 1 kg (2.2 lb.) of hydrogen is many times that of 1 kg of CO 2 .

Leakage could come from pipelines, and the farther the hydrogen is carried, the greater the chance of losses. Moreover, the small size of the hydrogen molecule makes it prone to leak.

The issue of leakage was underestimated for natural gas infrastructure until it was measured and understood, Krupp said. The problem should be carefully looked at, Airbus Chief Technical Officer Sabine Klauke said at the summit. Airbus is working on the issue with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and German aerospace research center DLR, she said, adding that “there are technical means to deal with it.”

As governments fund hydrogen projects, “we have to make sure those subsidies go along with leakage measurement,” Krupp said.

Airbus is working on adding catalysts at those places where hydrogen is about to leak, Klauke said. The catalyst causes a chemical reaction with oxygen, thus forming water. Universal Hydrogen, which is developing an ATR 72 hydrogen retrofit, uses such catalysts on its hydrogen modular tanks.

Meanwhile, Airbus is gearing up to start measuring the composition of the exhaust gases downstream in a hydrogen combustion engine. Under its Blue Condor project, the airframer is modifying two gliders with one small engine each. One is being designed to burn conventional Jet A1 fuel and the other one hydrogen, permitting a back-to-back comparison.

The focus is set to be on contrail formation, as contrails generate cirrus clouds. The question to be answered is how two opposing factors play out downstream in a hydrogen-burning engine: the absence of soot (which act as nuclei for the formation of droplets) and the greater generation of water vapor. Nitrogen oxides (NOx) are also to be measured. Instruments will be fitted to a light aircraft that will follow the gliders.

One modified glider has started flying but without the liquid hydrogen system, Sandra Bour Schaeffer, CEO of technology innovation arm Airbus UpNext, said at the summit. Flight testing is planned for the first quarter of 2023.

Airbus’ revelation that it will test a hydrogen fuel cell on an A380 testbed comes 18 months after the launch of the ZEROe project and the initial focus on burning hydrogen in gas turbine engines. An engine close to a turbofan was believed to offer a lighter-weight solution and therefore be more suitable for aviation. Airbus now wants to keep all options open, especially as a fuel cell may have less climate impact overall.

The 2.1-megawatt engine, resembling a conventional turboprop, is planned to be fitted on an upper-fuselage wing stub that is also being designed to test a GE Passport as part of a joint effort with CFM. The fuel cell engine test campaign is scheduled for the same period, 2026-28.

Both technologies use liquid hydrogen and are being explored in parallel, Llewellyn said. “At scale, and if the technology targets were achieved, fuel cell engines may be able to power a 100-passenger aircraft with a range of approximately 1,000 nm,” he added. “We are giving ourselves additional options that will inform our decisions on the architecture of our future ZEROe aircraft, the development of which we intend to launch in the 2027-28 time frame.”

A hydrogen fuel cell and the associated electric motor and propeller are expected to be more efficient than burning hydrogen in a gas turbine. Other benefits include the absence of NOx (which is suspected of contributing to global warming) and an even lower probability of forming contrails, which are known to play a role in global warming.

The test engine is being put together in Hamburg, Germany. It has been assessed at subsystem level, as the electric motor is still being tested.

Airbus has been cooperating with fuel-cell specialist ElringKlinger. In 2020, the two companies created a joint venture, Aerostack. The fuel cell in the test engine uses an arrangement that puts together cells into stacks, and the stacks into four so-called channels, making the layout scalable.

Before installation on the A380, full engine evaluations will take place at Airbus’ E-Aircraft System House ground-test center in Munich.

For the test engine, the Hamburg team kept subsystems segregated for better accessibility. Engineers came from the company’s space division—to take advantage of their skills in batteries—and Airbus Helicopters, for the gearbox that will link the motor and the propeller.

The biggest challenge will be weight. One should look at the full equation, factoring in the better efficiency, Hauke Luedders, head of fuel-cell propulsion systems for zero-emission aircraft, said at the summit.",Airbus CEO Warns Sustainability Progress Is Not Coming Fast Enough

This represents over 90% of Airbus’ future aircraft orders. Planes qualify for the criteria if they meet weak fuel efficiency standards, even though they still rely almost exclusively on fossil fuels.

The European Commission is currently discussing criteria for aviation to be included in EU taxonomy rules. Under the draft criteria recommended in 2022 by the Platform on Sustainable Finance, traditional aircraft qualify as “best in class” if they are more efficient[1] than older generation aircraft. These aircraft then meet the EU Taxonomy’s criteria only if they are replacing, not expanding an airline’s fleet.

Even though more fuel efficient planes emit less, these emissions savings are only around 15-20%. Critically, this has not stopped CO 2 emissions from the sector from growing exponentially in recent decades. CO 2 emissions increased by 129%[2] between 1990 and 2017 despite fuel efficiency of new aircraft improving by 18%[3] over the same period.

Jo Dardenne, aviation director at T&E, says: “Sticking a green investment label on thousands of highly polluting planes is an act of pure greenwashing. The European Commission must reverse course. Unsurprisingly, Airbus is lobbying relentlessly to ensure aviation stays in the taxonomy. But this would be a mere smokescreen that allows them to sell dirty planes for years to come. Instead, they should focus efforts and investments in zero-emission aircraft that are truly green.”

Airlines will also be affected by the EU taxonomy. For the time being, the majority of Europe’s airlines’ fleets don’t qualify as “best in class”. But their future planes will. 100% of order books by Ryanair, easyJet and Wizz Air could be considered “best in class”, as they plan to buy new generation, more efficient aircraft in the years to come. If these planes replace older aircraft, they will be compliant with the taxonomy. As a result, up to 58% of easyJet’s fleet could be taxonomy compliant, despite exclusively relying on fossil fuel to operate in the next decade.

Airlines will not only see part of their investments into future fleets rubber stamped as green, but the revenues generated from flights on these planes will also carry the same label. In practice, this means that a flight from Paris to New York, on board a slightly more efficient aircraft, could be considered green in the eyes of investors.

Transport & Environment is calling on the European Commission to amend the criteria for aviation in the EU Taxonomy. These should strictly endorse new technologies with true emissions reduction potential, such as zero-emission aircraft and high quality sustainable aviation fuels.

Note to editors: Transport & Environment (T&E) was part of the Platform on Sustainable Finance until 14th of September 2022 and left the group over a lack of independence. T&E does not support the criteria under consideration for aviation, as it greenwashes the aircraft manufacturing’s legacy business and provides no incentives for genuinely green investments. Airbus, the EU’s main aircraft manufacturer, was co-drafting criteria for its own products.

Summary

Summary Companies Companies set up $200 million fund last year

To make first investment in about a month -Airbus exec

Investments will be $1 million-plus, possibly before Series A















MELBOURNE, Feb 27 (Reuters) - Airbus SE (AIR.PA) and Qantas Airways Ltd (QAN.AX) plan to announce the first investment from a $200 million fund to develop a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) industry in Australia within about a month, an Airbus executive said on Monday.

The companies established the fund last year after Qantas set a target of using 10% SAF in its fuel mix by 2030 and placed a multibillion-dollar order for Airbus narrowbody and widebody planes.

Australia lacks an SAF industry, meaning Qantas' purchases of the fuel are made at overseas airports.

Stephen Forshaw, Airbus' chief representative for Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific, said the manufacturer and Qantas were meeting weekly to discuss $1 million-plus investments in early stage SAF projects in Australia.

""The first investment has been made but not fully closed yet,"" he said in an interview ahead of the Australia International Airshow, which begins on Tuesday. ""We've both agreed to it, and I think we'll make some announcements probably in the next month or so around the completion of that.""

Qantas declined to comment.

Forshaw said most of the investments being considered involved seed funding, where the partners might take a minority equity stake.

""Some of them may be even earlier than Series A. What it may do is provide us with the opportunity or right of first refusal to go in at Series A or Series B or beyond,"" he said. ""And then the pace will determine whether we want to do that or whether we see it is time to open it up to other investors.""

He declined to say what type of project was planned for the first investment but said that in the longer term, Australia had lots of potential to use solar power for projects that would help meet demand given limited feedstock available from sources like oils and fats.

Qantas Chief Sustainability Officer Andrew Parker last week told analysts the airline could meet its 2030 target of 10% SAF solely through purchases in London and California if needed, but noted that 70% of the airline's total fuel was sourced from Australia.

""We know we have to play a lead role in developing a domestic industry,"" he said, adding there could be local production by the second half of the decade.

Qantas expects about 60% of its fuel could be SAF by 2050 to meet its target of net zero emissions by that date.

The annual summit of European aerospace prime Airbus saw a fleet of new partnerships and initiatives introduced that are geared to pushing the aviation industry toward reaching environmental goals in sustainability.

The projects announced between 31 November and 1 December cover a range of improvements, with interventions at a number of stages in the hydrogen fuel delivery ladder, as well as partnerships with CERN and Renault to improve electrification prospects, and progress in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Airbus to fly a new aerodynamic demonstrator by the end of the year

Airbus used its annual summit to introduce the DisruptiveLab, a new flying laboratory meant to test ideas aimed at improving aircraft performance and lowering CO2 emissions from helicopters.

The DisruptiveLab will test a new aerodynamic architecture designed to cut fuel consumption, as well as pursue hybridisation with a fully parallel hybrid propulsion system that allows the battery to be recharged in-flight. The demonstrator will begin flight testing before the end of the year.

“The DisruptiveLab goes another step further in Airbus Helicopters’ ambitious strategy to reduce the environmental impact of its helicopters and to lead the way towards a sustainable aerospace industry,” said Bruno Even, CEO of Airbus Helicopters.

To validate the combined impact on CO2 reduction, which may be up to 50%, the architecture and parallel hybrid propulsion system could only be evaluated on a brand-new demonstrator, explained Even.

An aerodynamic fuselage made of aluminium and composite material is part of the DisruptiveLab’s architecture. This was created with the goal of lowering drag and, consequently, fuel consumption. Because of the way the blades are integrated into the rotor, the rotor head can be made smaller, reducing drag and raising energy efficiency while also reducing noise. A more efficient Fenestron tail rotor built into its lighter rear fuselage also adds to better performance.

The French Council for Civil Aviation Research Council has included the DisruptiveLab demonstrator in its roadmap, and the French Civil Aviation Authority has contributed funding to it as part of the French Stimulus plan, which is a component of the European Plan, Next Generation EU, and the France 2030 plan.

The strategy of Airbus Helicopters relies on demonstrations to quickly test and develop new technology. In 2020, the company began developing its first FlightLab demonstrator. The FlightLab is primarily focused on researching and developing technologies related to improved autonomy and safety technology bricks and operates on an existing H130 platform. The DisruptiveLab, on the other hand, will concentrate on enhancing aircraft performance and minimising environmental impact.

Hydrogen fuel cell being developed for launch by 2035

Airbus also announced that it is working on a new hydrogen-powered fuel cell engine. The propulsion system is being looked at as one of the potential alternatives to outfit an emission-free aircraft that will go into service by 2035.

By the middle of the decade, Airbus will begin testing this fuel cell engine architecture in the air and on the ground using its ZEROe demonstrator aircraft. Currently being converted to hold liquid hydrogen tanks and the distribution systems that go with them is the A380 MSN1, a flight test aircraft for new hydrogen technology.

Glenn Llewellyn, VP Zero-Emission Aircraft, Airbus, stated that fuel cells “are a potential solution to help us achieve our zero-emission ambition”.

“We are focused on developing and testing this technology to understand if it is feasible and viable for a 2035 entry-into-service of a zero-emission aircraft.”

Fuel cell engines might be able to power a 100-passenger aeroplane with a range of about 1,000 nautical miles if the technology goals were met and scaled up, explained Llewellyn.

“By continuing to invest in this technology we are giving ourselves additional options that will inform our decisions on the architecture of our future ZEROe aircraft, the development of which we intend to launch in the 2027-2028 timeframe.”

Because hydrogen can be produced from renewable energy sources without emitting any carbon dioxide, and because water is one of its main byproducts, it has been highlighted by Airbus as one of the most viable choices for powering a zero-emission aeroplane.

Hydrogen can be utilised as an aeroplane propulsion fuel in two different methods. The first method involves burning hydrogen in a gas turbine. The second method involves employing hydrogen fuel cells to turn it into electricity to power a propeller engine. In a hybrid-electric architecture, fuel cells can be connected with a hydrogen gas turbine in place of batteries.

Scalability is made possible by the increased power output of hydrogen fuel cells, particularly when they are stacked. Additionally, a hydrogen fuel cell-powered engine produces no NOx emissions or contrails, providing further advantages for decarbonisation.

For some time now, Airbus has been researching the potential of fuel cell propulsion systems in the aviation industry. As a joint venture with ElringKlinger, a business with more than 20 years of experience as a supplier of fuel cell systems and component, Airbus established Aerostack in October 2020. Airbus unveiled its pod-concept, which had six removable fuel cell propeller propulsion units, in December 2020.

Partnership with HyPort for hydrogen distribution

Airbus has partnered with France green hydrogen developer, HyPort, in a venture between ENGIE Solutions and the Regional Agency for Energy and Climate in Occitanie, to support the construction of one of the first low carbon hydrogen production and distribution facilities at an airport.

The production, storage, and distribution systems are currently undergoing final testing, and the construction of the hydrogen station at Toulouse-Blagnac airport was finished earlier this year. With a daily production capacity of 400kg of hydrogen, the station, which is expected to go into operation in early 2023 and will be able to power 50 ground transportation vehicles.

Working with HyPort, Airbus is developing a deployment strategy for the expansion of these hydrogen-powered ground operations, adjusting infrastructure capacity, production and distribution methods, and other factors to meet the anticipated rise in hydrogen demand over the next few years. A roadmap describing needs and offering advice on operational safety, regulatory compliance, public acceptance, as well as the financial investment required for the broad use of hydrogen at airports, will also be provided under the partnership.

“Our involvement with HyPort demonstrates the tangible progress Airbus is making on its journey to secure the future energy ecosystems of tomorrow,” said Karine Guenan, VP ZEROe Ecosystem, Airbus.

“Using hydrogen to decarbonise all airport-associated ground transport in the 2020 to 2030 timeframe will pave the way for hydrogen availability for zero-emission aircraft by 2035.”

In order to assist airports in identifying the infrastructure needs for upcoming hydrogen aircraft as well as low-carbon airport operations across the whole value chain, Airbus introduced “Hydrogen Hub at Airports” in 2020. Following this, Airbus has partnered with numerous airport authorities, airlines, and energy suppliers in Europe, Asia-Pacific, and North America during the past two years.

Joint venture with ArianeGroup for the first ZEROe hydrogen refuelling facility

The first liquid hydrogen refuelling facility for ZEROe aircraft will be constructed at Toulouse, Blagnac airport by Airbus and ArianeGroup. The station is a joint venture, equally owned by Airbus and Safran, a leading firm in space propulsion technologies.

The liquid hydrogen fuelling system required for Airbus’ ZEROe demonstrator’s ground and flight test programme, which is scheduled to begin in the middle of this decade, will be designed, manufactured, and operated by ArianeGroup.

“Many of the technologies required for a zero-emission aircraft are already available in other industries, and liquid hydrogen handling is no exception,” said Sabine Klauke, chief technical officer, Airbus.

The ArianeGroup have pedigree in this role. For more than 40 years, liquid hydrogen has been the primary propulsion source for Ariane launch vehicles, built by ArianeGroup as the prime contractor.

Airbus and Neste partner on Sustainable Aviation Fuel

In order to enhance the production and use of SAF, Airbus and Neste, a global producer of renewable fuels, have signed a memorandum of understanding to cooperate in this area. Both parties agree that SAF is an important strategy for lowering aviation’s contribution to global warming, with the goal of this partnership being to quicken the transition to SAF in the aviation industry.

The ramp-up of SAF production is one of the main obstacles to boosting SAF use, according to Neste and Airbus. By working together, the companies hope to build the groundwork for advancing in SAF technology throughout the whole aircraft industry.

The partnership’s emphasis will be on fuel approval and testing of present and upcoming production technologies, as well as on the technical advancement of SAF and looking into how 100% SAF use may be made possible.

SAF is one of the most promising decarbonisation technologies in aerospace that can be used for today and tomorrow’s fleet of aircraft, according to Julie Kitcher, EVP communications and corporate affairs at Airbus.

Airbus aircraft are already certified to fly with up to 50% SAF, and through this venture they hope to achieve certification for up to 100% SAF before the end of the decade.

Following the study on SAF into the “Emission and Climate Impact of Alternative Fuels” with the German research centre DLR, this is the second joint venture between Airbus and Neste.

Battery research with Renault for electrification

Airbus and Renault Group have partnered on research and development projects with the goal of accelerating both businesses’ electrification roadmaps and expanding their respective product lines. This agreement, announced during the Airbus Summit, is intended to assist Airbus in developing technology related to future hybrid-electric aircraft.

As part of this collaboration, the engineering teams from Airbus and Renault Group will work together to advance energy storage technologies, components systems that continue to be a major barrier to the development of long-range electric vehicles. The cooperation agreement will specifically cover technology bricks for improving battery weight and energy management, and it will look for the best ways to transition from current cell chemistries (advanced lithium-ion) to all solid-state designs that could double battery energy density by 2030.

In order to prepare for the industrialisation of these future battery designs while evaluating their carbon footprint throughout their entire existence, the combined endeavour will also research the complete lifecycle of future batteries, from manufacture through recyclability.

If it is successful, the collaboration between Airbus and Renault Group on electrification will have significant influence on the transportation environment and achievement of the aviation and automotive industries’ goal of having net-zero emissions by 2050.

CERN bring expertise to bear to assist Airbus with superconductivity

A project to assess how superconductivity may aid in the decarbonisation of future aircraft systems has been launched by Airbus UpNext and CERN, the European Laboratory for Particle Physics. The Super-Conductor for Aviation with Low Emissions (SCALE) initiative aims to encourage the application of superconducting technology in aerial electrical distribution systems.

CERN’s director of finance and human resources, Raphael Bello, stated that the organisation’s research “pushes the boundaries of science and engineering” and collaborates with business to foster innovation with a favourable effect on the environment.

This partnership with Airbus tests the potential of these technologies to meet the requirements of upcoming clean transportation and mobility solutions.

“This partnership is only a first step in our journey with the European leader in aviation and shows how much we value the excellence of our Member States’ industry,” continued Bello.

To investigate the viability of this technology for electric and hybrid aircraft, researchers are already working on a superconductivity demonstrator called ASCEND (Advanced superconducting and Cryogenic Experimental PowertraiN Demonstrator). The demonstrator comprises of a DC link (cable and cryostat) with two current leads, and Helium gas used to cool the system.

The first results are expected at the end of 2023. CERN will design, build, and test SCALE to Airbus UpNext requirements, and by the end of 2025 the programme hopes to have developed and tested an optimised generic superconductor cryogenic (500kW) powertrain.",Airbus summit comes with raft of environmental design initiatives

After 64 days of continuous flight, a solar-powered drone-satellite developed by Airbus Defense and Space crashed in the desert in the US state of Arizona on Aug. 18. The incident did not cause any injuries.

“The prototype aircraft's flight ended when the Zephyr 8 UAS encountered events that led to its unexpected shutdown,” said the US Army Command in a statement.

The drone was launched from the Yuma Proving Ground (YPG) test site in Arizona on June 15. The unmanned aircraft soared more than 60,000 feet (about 18 km) over the southern United States, the Gulf of Mexico, and South America, before returning to its starting point. Prior to the crash, air traffic control data showed the drone flying at an unusually low altitude.

“The military and its partners have collected invaluable data and increased knowledge about the endurance, battery efficiency, and station-keeping capabilities of the aircraft at high altitudes,” said said Michael Monteleone, director of the military program overseeing the flight. “This knowledge will allow us to continue to advance the requirements for reliable and modernized stratospheric capabilities for our soldiers.”

The drone, which is remotely controlled by satellite, weighs 75 kg. It has a wingspan of 25 meters and is entirely covered with PV modules with multi-junction cells. The system enabled the aircraft to travel more than 55,000 km, or more than one trip around the Earth.

The Zephyr 8 drone managed to double the previous endurance record for an unmanned aircraft, which was just under 26 days. Within a few hours, it would have been able to break the record for the longest flight in history, held by two American airmen, at 64 days, 22 hours, 19 minutes and five seconds in the sky.

Airbus Ventures led the round and was joined by AEI HorizonX–a joint venture between Boeing and leading private equity firm AE Industrial Partners–as well as GPVC, Stellar Ventures, Industrious Ventures and others.

A Solestial announcement says the new funding will be used to ramp up production and customer engagement as the company expands ground and flight testing. It will also fund research and development and sales and marketing activities.

Solestial’s core technology, which it has been working on for a decade as an Arizona State University spinout, is an “ultra-thin” silicon solar cell that can self-cure radiation damage at normal operating temperatures in space, the company says. It is packaged in a “flexible, lightweight panel designed to achieve minimum degradation for up to 10 years in LEO.” What is more, the panels can be mass-produced using automation, resulting in 90% lower costs than incumbent technologies and “virtually unlimited” manufacturing capacity.

“From the start of our diligence process, we were instantly impressed by Solestial’s solar cell technology, and we’re proud to be leading this impressive syndicate on a mission to help deliver advanced, lightweight, cost-effective solutions that power the new space economy,” says Mat Costes, partner at Airbus Ventures.

Airbus Defense and Space has announced it will team with researchers from the University of New South Wales on a strategic research program to fast-track the development of high-efficiency solar cells to be used in space.

Airbus Defense and Space, a division of Airbus, has selected the University of New South Wales (UNSW) in Sydney to conduct a multi-year research project that is expected to push the performance of PV cells for space to the limit, both in terms of efficiency and radiation stability.

Airbus said the 3.5-year project will focus on the solar cells that are presently used to power spacecraft. Those cells are composed of several different layers of semiconductor materials that selectively absorb different parts of the solar spectrum. This selectivity enables the cells to operate more efficiently than the standard silicon solar cells used on domestic rooftops.

Professor Ned Ekins-Daukes, a researcher from the UNSW Sydney School of Photovoltaic and Renewable Energy Engineering, said the project will explore the merit of introducing patterned, non-planar layers into the cell structure, a technique known as interstitial light-trapping, which can further confine particular wavelengths of light into particular layers of the solar cell.

“Our research on high-efficiency solar cells can help extend the operational life of a spacecraft and lead to light-weight, lower-cost solar arrays,” he said.

Ekins-Daukes, who has previously developed nanostructured, strain-balanced PV absorbers that have utility for solar power conversion in the space environment, said the partnership with Airbus has the potential to open opportunities for commercialization of this technology in Australia and internationally.

“Partnering with Airbus’ experts will help us to understand the broader aerospace industry requirements for solar power and realise the full potential for these future solar power technologies,” he said.

Airbus Defense and Space UK Managing Director Richard Franklin said the project is a perfect example of industry and academia working together to develop and commercialize technologies to benefit and support the defence and space sectors in Australia.

As a contributor to carbon emissions, the aerial transport industry is keen to switch to greener energy sources. Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and hydrogen fuel cells are plausible solutions that could do the heavy lifting for long-haul transport. The solar-powered flight is yet another option that is being explored.

So far, solar-powered flights have been used to traverse the globe. With its Zephyr range of planes, airplane major Airbus is also using the renewable and most abundant form of energy to power long-duration flights.

Airbus Zephyr

The Zephyr isn't a commercial airplane meant to transport people over long distances. Instead, it is a High Altitude Platform Station (HAPS) that can fly in the stratosphere at around 70,000 feet (21 km), almost twice that of regular jet-engine powered aircraft.

The aircraft has 82 feet (25 m) wingspan but weighs under 165 pounds (75 kg). According to its website, the Zephyr is payload agnostic and can be used to capture imagery or radar or automatic identification systems for military, institutional or commercial uses. At its highest altitude, a single Zephyr can provide the coverage equivalent of 250 cell towers and could be used to improve connectivity in the remotest parts of the world.",Airbus' solar-powered Zephyr plane just crashed after a 64-day flight

The competition winners will receive access to Airbus’s Pléiades and Pléiades Neo satellite constellations and $5,000 in financing.

The satellites deliver images with resolutions down to 30 centimeters (12 inches) and could be used in applications such as anti-poaching, forest monitoring, and species population assessments.

The Airbus Foundation and the Connected Conservation Foundation (CCF) recently announced a new award for research that would use satellites to aid in biodiversity conservation.

The application period, open to individual researchers and nonprofit organizations, began Dec. 5 and ends Feb. 3, 2023. A team of four judges will assess the potential of proposals designed to address the global loss of species, which many scientists call Earth’s sixth mass extinction. Along with $5,000 in funding, the award comes with access to Airbus’s Pléiades and Pléiades Neo satellites. Pléiades Neo images come from a quartet of satellites offering spatial resolution down to 30 centimeters (12 inches).

“The open call sets out to look at the species in situations where high, 30-centimeter resolution imagery can really have a benefit,” Sophie Maxwell, executive director of CCF and one of the judges of the competition, told Mongabay.

CCF is an organization that aims to encourage the use of technology in conservation and nature protection applications, such as anti-poaching and population monitoring. In 2021, the group partnered with the Airbus Foundation, the philanthropic arm of the European aerospace company.

The goal, Maxwell said, is to find the bounds of the role that remote sensing can play in biodiversity conservation, including what it does and doesn’t do well.

“We have looked at use cases such as road detection [and] charcoal kiln detection, with variable levels of success,” Maxwell said. High-resolution imagery can help biologists better tabulate the sizes of wildlife populations. But there are limitations. Picking out the shapes of wildebeest against the varied background of an East African savanna, for instance, can be difficult, so projects aimed at monitoring on a more uniform background may work better, she added.

“One of the best examples perhaps would be counting penguins or other birds in the Arctic or Antarctic on their breeding grounds,” said Anna Schweiger, a postdoctoral researcher in remote sensing at Switzerland’s University of Zurich, who is not affiliated with CCF or the Airbus Foundation.

Schweiger noted that Pléiades Neo has a deep blue band for probing bodies of water. She said scientists have used WorldView, another set of satellites, to spot whales in clear water as deep as 30 meters (approximately 100 feet).

Schweiger said deep learning, a kind of machine learning and artificial intelligence, could be employed in tandem with Pléiades’ high-resolution imagery to gain new insights.

“The explosion of AI on satellite imagery is also making it much more … valuable and easier to get insights … because you’ve got analysis running on these huge images,” Maxwell said.

Schweiger said that scientists must be careful with the results of remote sensing, and noted that this type of imagery could have uses beyond conservation. (Airbus, for example, markets access to the Pléiades satellite constellation for military and intelligence uses.)

It’s also possible that imagery detailing, say, “the migratory routes of large swarms of fish,” could fall into the wrong hands, Schweiger said. “I can see that being a detriment to the survival of certain species.”

Still, Maxwell said addressing the biodiversity crisis requires innovative solutions, which she hopes the competition for this award will help to drive.

“This is a great chance to explore where this technology can help conservation efforts,” she added.

Among the most notable are its development of a zero-emission hydrogen fuel cell engine, and a collaboration with fuel producer Neste aimed at speeding the adoption of sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF.

The company revealed these and other plans during its annual Airbus Summit taking place today and tomorrow in Toulouse, France.

Airbus said it will begin ground and flight testing its fuel cell engine on the A380 demonstrator aircraft known as ZEROe “towards the middle of the decade.” The company said the aircraft is being modified so it can carry liquid hydrogen fuel tanks.

“Fuel cells are a potential solution to help us achieve our zero-emission ambition and we are focused on developing and testing this technology to understand if it is feasible and viable for a 2035 entry-into-service of a zero-emission aircraft,” said Glenn Llewellyn, vice president of zero-emission aircraft for Airbus.

Airbus said that with continued development, fuel cell engines could potentially power a 100-passenger aircraft with a range of 1,000 nm. Its current testing will offer options for the design of a future ZEROe aircraft, which Airbus said it plans to launch “in the 2027-2028 timeframe.”

Airbus also said it entered an agreement with Neste aimed at advancing the production and adoption of SAF across the aviation market. The companies said they “share a vision that SAF is a key solution to helping reduce greenhouse gas emissions of air travel. This collaboration aims to accelerate the aviation sector’s transition to SAF.”

Neste and Airbus said the new agreement will allow them to work together to more easily drive production and use of SAF while pursuing business opportunities and new fuel technology. Airbus and Neste said one of their main goals is “investigating how ‘100 percent SAF’ use can be enabled.”

Airbus said all of its aircraft are currently certified to fly with a blend of up to 50 percent SAF. It expects the partnership with Neste to be “instrumental to reaching certification for up to 100 percent SAF before the end of the decade.”

Other activities at the Summit included unveiling Airbus’ DisruptiveLab, a new airborne lab within a helicopter that tests technology for cutting the CO2 emissions of helicopters. The company said the lab will “evaluate a new aerodynamic architecture intended to reduce fuel consumption, as well as pursuing the implementation of hybridization with a fully parallel hybrid propulsion system that enables the battery to be recharged in-flight.”

ALAMEDA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Wind River®, a global leader in delivering software for mission-critical intelligent systems, today announced it has worked with Airbus to support the A330 Multi-Role Tanker Transport (MRTT) aircraft for automatic air-to-air refueling (A3R). The MRTT aircraft is the world’s first tanker to be certified for automatic air-to-air refueling boom operations in daylight.

Airbus uses VxWorks 653 for the A330 MRTT air-to-air refueling boom system (ARBS). This system is comprised of multiple ARINC 653-compliant applications running at multiple levels of safety-criticality and achieved DO-178C DAL A certification.

With this development, the Airbus A330 MRTT A3R capability has earned the distinction of being certified by the Spanish National Institute for Aerospace Technology (INTA), involving multiple ED-12C / DO-178C DAL A applications running simultaneously on multiple cores on a multicore processor.

“A3R is a significant milestone in the evolution of airborne refueling systems. It is an honor to work with Airbus and play an important role in its latest A3R achievement,” said Avijit Sinha, chief product officer, Wind River. “The use of our industry-leading technology demonstrates continuing Wind River leadership in safety-critical real-time software solutions for mission critical systems. Wind River is able to help customers successfully navigate the challenges and complexities around certification.”

“Airbus is the first worldwide company to certify an airborne military equipment with an embedded multicore processor to the highest assurance level DAL-A covering CAST-32A requirements. With the support of Wind River, Airbus successfully navigated its multicore certification journey to achieve this impressive milestone. In addition to delivering its proven industry leading technologies, Wind River was a trusted advisor to help identify milestones, potential obstacles, and develop key metrics during the process to ensure that the system architecture was on the right track,” said Andrés Morán Valero, multicore certification team leader, Air Refueling Software group, Airbus.

The automated A3R system enables more efficient operation, reduces air refueling operator (ARO) workload, reduces inherent risk of this operation and optimizes the rate of air-to-air refueling transfer. In A3R, advanced technologies can identify the receiving aircraft’s shape and its refueling receptacle, then perform automated contact and fuel transfer while flying at high altitude.

Proven in the most challenging safety-critical applications, VxWorks 653 makes it easier and more cost-effective for technology suppliers to meet the stringent safety certification requirements of EN 50128, IEC 61508, ISO 26262, and ED-12C / DO-178C.

Reaching the aviation industry’s ambitious “net zero carbon emissions by 2050” goal, requires different measures to be deployed, including fuel-efficient aircraft technologies, improved operations and ground infrastructures, as well as deployment of sustainable aviation fuel.



Neste and Airbus recognize that one of the biggest challenges in accelerating SAF use is the ramp-up of SAF production. This collaboration is laying the foundation for Airbus and Neste to explore business opportunities together and jointly promote the production and use of sustainable aviation fuel. The focus will be on the technical development of SAF, fuel approval and testing of current and future production technologies, and investigating how ""100% SAF"" use can be enabled.



“Neste is at the forefront of accelerating the aviation sector’s journey to a more sustainable future. That journey requires cooperation across the industry’s value chain. This collaboration with Airbus connects a pioneer in the aerospace industry with a leader in renewable fuels. The combined knowledge and expertise of the companies will help advance the use and availability of SAF as a means of transitioning aviation towards more sustainable energy sources and reducing the climate impact of aviation,” said Thorsten Lange, Executive Vice President, Renewable Aviation at Neste.



“At Airbus, we believe SAF is one of aerospace’s most promising decarbonisation solutions that can be used in both in-service aircraft fleets and those of tomorrow. We are proud to partner with Neste and drive forward the development and uptake of SAF, stimulating the creation of a commercially viable market for renewable aviation fuels,” says Julie Kitcher, EVP Communications, Sustainability and Corporate Affairs, Airbus.

“All Airbus aircraft are already certified for flying with up to 50% SAF, and this partnership will be instrumental to reaching certification for 100% SAF by the end of the decade.”



The agreement between Neste and Airbus builds on the cooperation in the ECLIF3 research project, the world’s first in-flight emissions study using 100% SAF on a wide-body commercial passenger aircraft, with Rolls-Royce and German research centre DLR. Following the collaboration in the ECLIF3 project, Airbus and Neste will be further working on the technical aspects of the challenge to reach the 100% SAF certification.



SAF delivers the performance of conventional jet fuel but with a significantly smaller carbon footprint on a life cycle basis. Using Neste MY Sustainable Aviation Fuel™ reduces greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80%* over the fuel’s life cycle compared to using fossil jet fuel. Neste MY Sustainable Aviation Fuel is produced from sustainably sourced 100% renewable waste and residue raw materials, including used cooking oil and animal fat waste. Prior to use, SAF is blended with conventional jet fuel and works seamlessly with existing fueling infrastructure and aircraft engines.

Most waste produced on international flights is commonly subjected to strict health controls, and the bulk is still either sent to landfill or to be incinerated. Certain items, however, can be recycled – although, until recently, airlines have had limited recycling success.

Emirates says it is determined to improve its onboard waste management processes, and at its core is the airline’s hard-working cabin crew, who have to quickly separate glass and plastic bottles as they collect meal trays and waste during a flight.

Recyclable materials are separated into dedicated storage units and then sent to a recycling plant in Dubai. Health controls still prevent recyclable material from being sent to any other facility apart from an airline’s home hub – an issue that affects every airline.

Glass bottles are separated by colour and crushed into reusable ‘cullets’ which can then be remelted and turned into brand-new bottles.

Meanwhile, plastic bottles are chopped into plastic flakes and sent to manufacturers to make brand new plastic bottles – including, in some cases, Emirates’ economy-class inflight blankets. Each one is made out of 28 recycled bottles.

Surprisingly, despite the sheer amount of plastic and glass recycled onboard last year, Emirates only started to separate recyclable material in 2019 after a member of cabin crew suggested the initiative during a regular feedback session. The idea was implemented within weeks.

The company is working to mimic the behavior of bird flight with wings that adapt their shape on the fly to optimize aerodynamics, making for more efficient aircraft with lower carbon footprints.

The eXtra Performance Wing project was borne out of a similar Airbus project called AlbatrossOne, which in 2019 saw engineers fly a scale-model airplane with flapping wing tips. Inspired by the albatross wing, the wings featured semi-aeroelastic hinges that responded to turbulence and gusts of wind to lessen the load on the airframe, reducing the need for reinforcing structures and saving considerable weight as a result.

Launched last September, the eXtra Performance Wing demonstrator is a continuation of this thinking, consisting of a scaled-down Cessna jet that can be fitted with gust sensors, pop-up spoilers and multifunctional trailing edges. The platform will be used to rapidly test and develop these types of technologies, with a view to improving aerodynamics for future aircraft.

“The scaled demonstrator will integrate and fly breakthrough wing technologies using a remote-controlled Cessna Citation VII business jet platform in representative flight conditions,” explained Oliver Family, Head of eXtra Performance Wing UK. “The partly 3D-printed wind-tunnel model – expertly built by the aerodynamics team at Airbus’ low-speed, wind-tunnel facility in Bristol – is a scaled-down version of the Cessna jet, incorporating the lightweight, long-span design of the eXtra Performance Wing that will provide the emissions benefits we are striving for.”

Aerospace engineers regularly turn to bird flight in an effort to improve aircraft performance. We've seen research projects show how shape-shifting wings can make aircraft more efficient, and others that demonstrate how owls could inspire planes that fly more quietly and handle strong winds. Airbus hopes that by exploring the possibilities of biomimicry at its Filton wind tunnel near Bristol, it can soon get some of these technologies off the ground.

“Airbus’ state-of-the-art low-speed wind-tunnel is a fantastic way to validate our concepts before flight tests,” added Oliver Family. “Our computational aerodynamic analysis capability is world class, and the wind tunnel provides another valuable way to measure the performance and capabilities of the aircraft before flight testing. The technologies we have tested in the Filton wind tunnel – many inspired by biomimicry – will now be rapidly integrated for flight testing.”

What’s worse is that most of those emissions are injected high into the Earth’s atmosphere, far away from the carbon sinks like trees on the Earth’s surface that could potentially sequester some of them. The air travel industry is aware of the problems, and companies like United Airlines and Airbus are searching for ways to lower their carbon footprint.

United Focuses On Ground Support Systems

The system of vehicles and equipment that supports air travel on the ground relies heavily on diesel engines. They power the tankers that refuel aircraft, the vehicles that take luggage back and forth to the planes, the vehicles that push planes back from the gate, and the buses that shuttle passengers to and from the airport.

The FAA says 1.7% of all emissions associated with air travel come from that ground support infrastructure. That may seem like a trivial amount — air travel itself is responsible for about 3% of all global emissions — but it’s still a lot. On a positive front, United announced this week it is investing in sodium-ion battery maker Natron Energy as part of its larger efforts to curb emissions all across its operations.

Sodium-ion batteries are nonflammable and can be made from relatively cheap, abundant, and nontoxic materials, including iron and manganese. They also can recharge tens of thousands of times before they degrade and need to be replaced, and they do not have the risk of thermal runaway like lithium-ion batteries do — an important consideration for equipment operating in close proximity to thousands of gallons of jet fuel.

Natron’s batteries could be used to electrify ground equipment, such as forklifts and pushback tractors, and to store renewable energy onsite — which might eventually be needed to recharge the batteries in electric passenger jets or flying taxis. “Aviation is an emerging space for us that appears to be potentially very high impact from a decarbonization perspective,” Colin Wessells, CEO of Natron Energy, told Canary Media.

While sodium batteries only have about half the energy density of their lithium-ion counterparts, that is less of a concern for stationary applications and heavy-duty equipment that mostly stays in one place. “This opens up the opportunity to safely electrify a lot of airport operations,” Wessells said.

United has recently invested in a number of companies that are searching for ways to transform its airplanes from oil guzzling machines to climate friendly aircraft powered by hydrogen fuel cells, batteries, or alternative jet fuels. “United is going to lead the way in decarbonizing this business, and this [investment] is another piece of that puzzle,” Michael Leskinen, president of United Airlines’ venture capital division, told Canary Media.

Airbus Experiments With Hydrogen Combustion And Fuel Cells

Airbus is one of the largest aircraft manufacturers in the world. Like United Airlines, it is working to lower the emissions associated with air travel. In an announcement this week, Airbus said it is developing a hydrogen-powered fuel cell engine. The propulsion system is being considered for use in the zero-emission aircraft it expects will enter service by 2035.

Airbus will start ground and flight testing this fuel cell engine architecture onboard its ZEROe demonstrator aircraft towards the middle of the decade. The A380 MSN1 flight test aircraft for new hydrogen technologies is currently being modified to carry liquid hydrogen tanks and their associated distribution systems.

“Fuel cells are a potential solution to help us achieve our zero-emission ambition and we are focused on developing and testing this technology to understand if it is feasible and viable for a 2035 entry-into-service of a zero-emission aircraft,” said Glenn Llewellyn, vice president for zero emission aircraft at Airbus.

“At scale, and if the technology targets were achieved, fuel cell engines may be able to power a one hundred passenger aircraft with a range of approximately 1,000 nautical miles. By continuing to invest in this technology we are giving ourselves additional options that will inform our decisions on the architecture of our future ZEROe aircraft, the development of which we intend to launch in the 2027–2028 time frame.”

There are two ways hydrogen can be used as a power source for aircraft propulsion, the company says. First, via hydrogen combustion in a gas turbine. Second, by using fuel cells to convert hydrogen into electricity in order to power a propeller engine. A hydrogen gas turbine can also be coupled with fuel cells instead of batteries in a hybrid-electric architecture. An engine powered by hydrogen fuel cells produces zero NOx emissions or contrails, which adds additional decarbonization benefits.

In a separate announcement, Airbus and Renault said they have signed a research and development agreement that will accelerate their electrification efforts and improve their future products.

The Airbus and Renault engineering teams will join forces to improve technologies related to energy storage, which remains one of the main roadblocks for the development of long-range electric vehicles. The cooperation agreement will include energy management optimization and battery weight improvement. In addition, the two teams will look for the best way to move from current cell technology to solid-state designs which could double the energy density of batteries.

“For the first time, two European leaders from different industries, are sharing engineering knowledges to shape the future of hydrid-electric aircrafts. Aviation is an extremely demanding field in terms of both safety and energy consumption, and so is the car industry. At Renault Group, our 10 years of experience in the electric vehicle value chain gives us some of the strongest feedback from the field and expertise in the performance of battery management systems,” said Gilles Le Borgne, executive vice president for engineering for Renault Group.

“Driven by the same ambition to innovate and reduce the carbon footprint, our engineering teams are exchanging with those of Airbus to converge transversal technologies that will enable both hybrid aircraft to be operated and the vehicles of tomorrow to be developed.”

“This cross-industry partnership with Renault Group will help us mature the next generation of batteries as part of Airbus’ electrification road map,” said Airbus CTO Sabine Klauke. “Reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2050 is a unique challenge that requires cooperation across sectors, starting today.

“Bringing together Renault Group’s experience in electric vehicles with our own track record in electric flight demonstrators will allow us to accelerate the development of the disruptive technologies required for future hybrid aircraft architectures in the 2030s and beyond. It will also foster the emergence of common technical and regulatory standards in support of the clean mobility solutions needed to achieve our climate targets.”

The Takeaway

Air travel is one of the wonders of modern technology. It shrinks time and distance so that you can board a plane at noontime in Sydney and be in LA in time for lunch the same day. (The International Date Line makes such weirdness possible.) But it raises the question of how much damage we are willing to tolerate for the convenience of flying.

United, Airbus, and Renault are far from the only companies focused on lowering emissions from air travel, and there is no guarantee they will be successful in their efforts. They deserve credit for at least addressing the issue. There is a lot of work to do yet, but if a way can be found to merge the convenience of air travel with zero-emissions technology, that will be good news for the environment and the planet.

The research flights, which started at the end of February are being conducted until the end of this month in specially reserved airspaces off the coast of France.

German aerospace research agency DLR is using its Falcon 20E research aircraft to fly ahead of the A321neo and measure the emissions and contrail formation from the A321neo.

The Airbus A321neo is using 100% SAF in both engines for the first time. Sensors and instrumentation onboard the Falcon 20E research aircraft are measuring the emissions and ice crystals formed in the aircraft’s exhaust plumes.

The flight tests are part of the VOL avec Carburants Alternatifs Nouveaux (VOLCAN) and the DLR Neofuels project. Partners on the project include Safran, Dassault Aviation and French research agency ONERA.

SAF, which has been shown to reduce the emissions of air travel by up to 80%, can currently only be used in aircraft up to a maximum blend of 50%. Most major aero-engine manufacturers and aircraft OEMs are investigating the use of 100% SAF blends.

While sustainable aviation fuels can reduce the climate impact of aviation, there are concerns over the increased formation of contrails.

The aim of the current flight tests is to measure the emissions from lean-burn combustion and to investigate the resulting contrail formation. According to DLR, a key question is whether other particles can lead to the formation of contrails, even when the soot emissions have already been reduced.

The A321neo is powered by CFM Leap-1A lean-burn engines that produce very little soot.

DLR Project Leader Christiane Voigt from the DLR Institute of Atmospheric Physics said, “We are particularly interested in how ice crystals form when several orders of magnitude less soot is emitted by the CFM Leap-1A engines in lean-burn mode.

“To do this, we will use the Falcon to conduct emission measurements both in the near field, approximately 100m behind the A321neo, as well as in the contrails in the far field at distances of several kilometres.”

The flight test program comprises of 15 flights. Different variants of Hydro-processed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) SAF are being tested under various modes of engine operation. HEFA is derived from used cooking oil and other waste fats, and is free of cyclic hydrocarbons (aromatics) and sulphur.

100% SAFs with no aromatics have several benefits such as the reduced generation of soot particles during combustion. This can also lead to a reduction in ice crystals that form on the soot. Reducing ice crystals and contrail formation can significantly reduce climate effects, as DLR has demonstrated together with NASA.

VOLCAN and Neofuels are the latest in a series of DLR flight tests to characterize the emissions of synthetic fuels, which started in 2015 with ECLIF1. These flight tests were continued in 2018 with the ECLIF2 campaign in collaboration with NASA. During the ECLIF3 campaign in 2021 the first emission measurements were conducted during flight tests using 100% SAFs on an A350, in partnership with Airbus and Rolls-Royce.",DLR and Airbus measure 100% SAF emissions with flight tests

The SAF-powered A380, given the title MSN 1, took off from Blagnac Airport in Toulouse, France at 08:43 local time on Friday, March 25. The aircraft flew for approximately three hours, powered by a Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engine running on sustainable fuel.

A second flight then took place on Tuesday, March 29 aimed at testing take-off and landing using sustainable fuels. This was the third Airbus aircraft type to fly on 100 percent SAF over the last year, and it is by far the largest. In March 2021, Airbus flew an Airbus A350 on sustainable fuel, followed by an SAF-powered A319neo single-aisle aircraft in October 2021.

For this month's first A380 flight, Airbus used 27 tons of unblended SAF that was provided by petroleum firm TotalEnergies and comprised mainly of cooking oil and other waste fats.",A massive Airbus A380 flew using 100% sustainable fuel made from cooking oil

Bringing not only hydrogen— but so-called green hydrogen—at the right price and quantity and from the right sources to the airports where Airbus’s ZEROe aircraft will operate stands among the foremost considerations. As Airbus vice president of ZEROe H2 ecosystem Karine Guenan put it, “there is no point having a zero-emission aircraft if the aircraft doesn’t meet airline needs.”

Appearing in Toulouse during the first day of Airbus’s recent Sustainability Summit, Guenan and Airbus vice present of zero-emission aircraft Glenn Llewelynn cited the scores of partnerships since the launch of the ZEROe project has entered to address infrastructure and “ecosystem” needs around the world. Just in the last year, it signed an agreement with Changi Airport Group, global industrial gases and engineering company Linde, and the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) to study the potential for a future hydrogen hub in the city-state. Other agreements in Asia-Pacific involve partners in Japan, South Korea, and Australia, while in the U.S. it inked an MOU with Delta Air Lines among other undisclosed partners, and in Europe with Milan Airport, Venice Airports, and the UK’s National Gas company.

Guenan also stressed the importance of Airbus’s discussions with electricity suppliers and its studies into the possibility of using current gas pipelines to transport hydrogen. “Securing an entire end-to-end clean hydrogen value chain is absolutely key,” she said. “And there is no point either in having a zero-emission aircraft if an airport can’t host and operate it.”

While studies continue into the infrastructure needed to support aircraft operation in 2035, recent efforts by Airbus have already yielded more immediate and concrete results. For example, Airbus has signed a partnership agreement with HyPort, a joint venture between Engie Solutions and the Regional Agency for Energy and Climate in Occitanie (AREC), to develop one of the world’s first low-carbon hydrogen production and distribution stations at an airport.

Crews completed construction of the hydrogen station at Toulouse-Blagnac airport earlier this year and the production, storage, and distribution systems are undergoing final testing. The station, scheduled to enter service in early 2023 next year, will carry the capacity to produce about 400 kg of hydrogen per day, providing the possibility to power some 50 ground transportation vehicles.

Airbus and HyPort continue work to put into place a deployment plan for the expansion of the hydrogen-fueled ground operations, adapting production and distribution means, as well as infrastructure capacity, to cope with the expected increase in hydrogen demand in the coming years. Airbus also expects the partnership to help outline requirements and provide guidance on the safety of operations, regulatory compliance, social acceptance, and the financial investment needed for the widespread use of hydrogen at airports.

“Our involvement with HyPort demonstrates the tangible progress Airbus is making on its journey to secure the future energy ecosystems of tomorrow,” said Guenan, “Using hydrogen to decarbonize all airport-associated ground transport in the 2020 to 2030 timeframe will pave the way for hydrogen availability for zero-emission aircraft by 2035.”

In 2020, Airbus launched “Hydrogen Hub at Airports'' to help airports identify infrastructure requirements for future hydrogen aircraft and low-carbon airport operations across the entire value chain.

The European aerospace group is preparing to start taking delivery of parts for its CityAirbus NextGen eVTOL prototype, allowing it to begin assembly of the four-seat vehicle this year ahead of the planned launch of flight testing in 2024.

Meanwhile, the scope of work to develop the ecosystem to support the new all-electric mode of transportation is also growing with more resources being committed to this effort. This year is already seeing the expansion of partnerships with prospective aircraft operators, infrastructure providers, and key policymakers across the spectrum of a diverse set of use cases that Airbus says will include medical services, commuter flights, and ecotourism. Work is underway with new use case initiatives in locations including Estonia, Germany, Italy, Latin America, Japan, and Saudi Arabia.

The CityAirbus NextGen is expected to have a range of 80 kilometers (50 miles) and a 120 km/h cruise speed, with projected noise levels below 70 dBA during takeoff and landing, and 65 dBA in flyover mode. At the HeliExpo show in Atlanta (March 6-9), Airbus will display a one-fifth-scale model of the aircraft, having brought a one-10th-scale version to the 2022 event.

Back in 2016, Airbus’s ACubed technology incubator first started work on the Vahana single-seat, fully autonomous eVTOL technology demonstrator, which was to take to the air for the first time in January 2018. By May 2019, it had the larger CityAirbus demonstrator flying, and the lessons learned from these projects proved to be the genesis for the CityAirbus NextGen program launched in September 2021.

“Now we feel we are at the execution stage,"" Balkiz Sarihan, head of urban air mobility (UAM) at Airbus, told a media briefing this week. ""The exploration is done and the ideas matured—now it’s getting really serious. For us, it’s always been about taking one step at a time. We don’t care about being the first or the fastest [to market].""

The first CityAirbus NextGen prototype will be built at the Airbus Helicopters facility at Donauwörth in southern Germany, where the company is establishing a dedicated test center for its eVTOL program. Significantly, though, the Airbus UAM business unit is not part of the group’s rotorcraft division and instead draws on expertise from across the wider company, tapping expertise in fields such as new propulsion technology.

The latest partners to join the program are Eaton and Crouzet, which will respectively provide the electrical power distribution system and the flight deck human-machine interface. These companies join a cast of suppliers that already includes Magicall (electric motors), KLK (rear fuselage structures), Spirit AeroSystems (wings), and Thales and Diehl Aerosystems (joint development of flight control computers).

The rest of the aircraft is being built in-house at Airbus. The Airbus Helicopters facility at Marignane in southern France is providing the flight control system and main fuselage sections while the batteries are coming from the group’s Defence & Space division and propeller development and testing are taking place at Paris Le Bourget Airport.

Safety First, Hydrogen to Follow

For dual redundancy, each vehicle will have 16 electric propulsion systems to support eight sets of propellers and motors. With the longer term in mind, Airbus is exploring how hydrogen propulsion systems might be applied to eVTOL aircraft, building on the group’s wider work for the ZeroE program to bring hydrogen-powered airliners to market by 2035.

For the foreseeable future, Airbus expects its eVTOL aircraft to have a pilot on board. Nonetheless, it anticipates a high degree of automation in the flight deck as the company’s engineering team follows the aircraft manufacturer’s wider “autonomy roadmap” based on the main objective of reducing pilot workload.

The latest ecosystem development initiative is in Estonia where Airbus is working with the ministries of health and the economy to explore ways to tap eVTOL connectivity to boost the performance of the Baltic state’s public healthcare system. The project, which is part of the wider LifeSaver program Airbus launched last year, involves mapping what the company describes as the “rescue chain” in provinces across Estonia. In addition to eVTOLs, Airbus is proposing to deploy helicopters and is also seeking to support operations with its communications satellite capability.

Plugging Healthcare Gaps

“With LifeSaver, we’re looking at healthcare needs at a country level to address gaps exposed during Covid,” Sarihan explained. “It’s not just about the vehicles; it involves creating an accreditation program for new operators, setting emergency medical services standards, and working with hospitals to make the rescue process work better.”

Closer to home in Bavaria, Airbus’s UAM team is working with Munich Airport and several cities on The Air Mobility Initiative. The partners intend to confirm locations in 2024 for an initial two vertiports and a network of predefined routes that could be scaled up after initial trial operations.

In Japan, local partner Hiratagukuen is already testing a possible new air mobility ecosystem using helicopters. These are being deployed to simulate eVTOL routes and a concept of operations for services in Kansai, and later in other areas, too.

Similar initiatives are underway in Chile, Peru, and Ecuador with Airbus Helicopters customer Ecocopter, as well as in Italy through a partnership with ITA Airways and in Saudi Arabia with rotorcraft group The Helicopter Company. Initially, type certification of the CityAirbus NextGen will be in Europe with EASA, followed by approval in the U.S. by the FAA.

According to Sarihan, winning public acceptance for eVTOL aircraft now requires more concerted attention. Within the European Union, Airbus has joined the Urban Air Mobility Cities Community initiative to step up public engagement across a network that already encompasses 42 cities.",Airbus Steps Up Delivery of eVTOL Aircraft Prototype and Operational Ecosystem

December 7, 2022, © Leeham News was at Airbus Summit: Airbus briefed media and influences on its Sustainability progress during briefings in Toulouse and Munich last week. Here is an update on where Airbus is with its programs.

The overall impression is of tangible progress on techno brick research and development and echo systems programs like SAF production and hydrogen supply and ground infrastructure.

At the summit, key customers like Airlines, technology partners, and leasing companies were part of the panels, giving the customer perspective and the view of the passengers.

The presented areas

Status were given for the following areas;

The status of SAF for the installed fleet and deliveries of regular turbofan jets.

The status of technology development for the 2035 introduction of a hydrogen-fueled airliner.

To what extent can hybrid be a part of Sustainable airliners, and how shall it be done?

Can helicopters be more sustainable, and how?

What part of air transport can UAM traffic systems do better?

SAF for yesterday’s and today’s turbofan airliners

Airbus had invited Neste, a pioneer in Sustainable Aircraft Fuel (SAF) to discuss the present status. Today most aircraft and engines can accept up to 50% mix of SAF/Jet-A1 blend. But we only have 0.1% SAF in production right now of the total usage of 350 million tonnes of jet fuel per year.

Neste will increase its production with new production plants from today’s 0.1 million tonnes to 2.2 million tonnes by 2026. Total production by 2026 will be around 5 million tonnes, a too-low figure.

To foster investment in SAF production capacity, we need a strong demand signal. Airbus and several airlines have set a goal of a 10% SAF mix by 2030 by it, creating a demand signal to the SAF producers.

It’s important to understand that a 10% mix for all 25,000 airliners flying each day is far more important than that one or two types can be delivered capable of flying a 100% mix by 2030. With a 100 or 200-per-year production rate, a 100% mix for an aircraft type will do nothing to reach carbon neutrality by 2050. A blend of 10% SAF by 2030 and 50% by 2040 will.

Airliners need changes in fuel systems and engines to go beyond 50%. It can only be achieved with newly produced aircraft. What shall we then do with the other 24,000 flying each day?

The development of a ZEROe airliner

Airbus has committed to introducing a hydrogen-fueled airliner by 2035. Several activities must be completed for such an introduction to be successful:

An airplane must be developed, certified, and produced.

An ecosystem with green hydrogen production and distribution must be set up.

Governments, Regulators, and Airlines must be brought onto the project so commercial traffic can be operated on commercially acceptable terms.

Hydrogen airliner development

Airbus is working on all the technobricks (Airbus speak for all the parts/system that are needed) that need to be explored and matured so a configuration decision can be made in 2027 after flight trials of a hydrogen Turbofan and a Fuel Cell turboprop has been done 2026 on a test A380 (Figure 1).

The tricky bits are the hydrogen fuel tank with piping/filling system and the fuel cell-based turboprop system. The hydrogen-burning turbofan is relatively straightforward; GE/CFM, Pratt & Whitney, and Rolls-Royce all have hydrogen-burning gas turbine knowledge and can offer an engine for 2035.

The tricky side of H2-burning engines is the emissions. CO2 emissions are zero, but the engine emits NOx and water vapor. The NOx emissions are reduced to around 20%, so it’s a five times improvement over today’s engine, and steam injection in the combustor, like for the SWITCH engine, could reduce this further.

The water vapor forming condensation trails is a problem that needs more research. It’s an altitude problem. There will be no condensation trails below and above a certain altitude. How tricky it will be to avoid the condensation altitudes is not fully understood. Therefore, Airbus is flying a glider with an H2 engine this winter; to learn more about this phenomenon.

The 2026 A380 flights with an H2 converted GE Passport engine will also investigate the contrail problem with a sniffer aircraft flying behind the A380 to sample the exhaust from the engine.

The fuel cell turboprop units will benefit from bench tests in Airbus’ ZEROe system test house in Ottobrun Munich. Systems are run with complete hydrogen-fueled fuel cell systems that power electric MegaWatt motors, running in normal conduction form and superconduction setups (Figures 2 and 3).

The results from these and OEM tests with burning H2 engines go into trade studies around different ZEROe airliners. These studies have already settled the H2 tank placement behind the rear pressure bulkhead of the fuselage.

The static Center of Gravity (CG) influence of duel tanks there (dual for redundancy) is compensated by moving the wing backward. As H2 is lighter than jet fuel for the same energy content, the variation in the center of gravity with different H2 levels during the mission is acceptable with such a tank placement.

The trade studies around the different propulsion alternatives are made with different size regional to single-aisle aircraft sizes. A typical size aircraft would be 100 seats with a 1,000nm range. It would be the practical limit for a fuel cell alternative, whereas an H2-burning alternative can be larger.

The hydrogen supply ecosystem

A major part of a feasible hydrogen airliner by 2035 is producing and distributing the necessary hydrogen to the aircraft. Airbus has a dedicated team that works with the hydrogen industry’s stakeholders to enable such an ecosystem, Figure 4.

It can use the space industry, which has used hydrogen as one of its primary fuels for 70 years, but also the road truck industry. Several truck manufacturers base their future long-haul trucks on hydrogen (due to energy density and refueling times), while their distribution trucks use batteries.

The world’s largest truck company, Daimler, with its Mercedes trucks, has decided on liquid hydrogen, LH2. It’s developing production and filling stations for the LH2 and will set this up in the thousands.

These will give Airbus and the H2 industry valuable insights, as it needs to equip perhaps 20 to 50 airports with this capacity to form a viable ecosystem. The pilot airport, Lyon, is already preparing to run its ground equipment vehicles on hydrogen from a pilot H2 storage and distribution system at the airport. Air Liquid will assist in setting this up based on its space launcher H2 knowledge.

Airbus showed examples of the hydrogen infrastructure that airports like Lyon will install, Figure 5.

How to use hybrid technology for airliners

The hybrid technology part of the Airbus Summit was refreshing. Airbus has realized that using hybrid technology to propel airliners doesn’t make sense. The energy source available, batteries, are just too inefficient. This is valid today but also tomorrow.

It doesn’t mean hybrid technology is dead in an airliner; it just has to be used cleverly. Forget about using it to propel the aircraft. A plane the size of an A320 uses 18 to 22 MegaWatt (MW) power to the fan during takeoff and 5 to 7 MW during cruise. There is NO way batteries can supply useful energy for such power needs (a battery system weighs about 5 tonnes for 1 MWh of energy).

Instead, use the electric technology in an expanded “more electric airplane” scheme. Place the auxiliary gearbox generators on the spools as starter motor generators and use these to assist the engines with their tricky power changes. Also, put electric motors on the main wheels and taxi on electric power. Convert a number of bleed or hydraulic power functions to electric.

We used to call this “the more electric aircraft.” The Airbus hybrid is an extension of this theme, rather than the classic hybrid interpretation, where electric energy is involved in the aircraft’s propulsion. It uses the advantages of electric functions and avoids the downside, the heavy and expensive batteries.

Can helicopters be more sustainable, and how

Helicopters are incredibly flexible as they can take off and land almost everywhere. But they are also noisy, vibrate a lot, and consume a lot of energy per passenger kilometer.

Airbus is the world’s largest helicopter manufacturer and is hard at work to address the above drawbacks and make the helicopter more environmentally friendly and sustainable.

It works on electrifying several of today’s mechanical functions to replace these with intelligently controlled electrical functions. For this purpose, it uses technology demonstrators, Figure 6.

What part of air transport can UAM traffic systems do better?

As described in my Friday Corner, Airbus is one of the few eVTOL developers that need not pitch to investors. Its strategy for the CityAirbus NG is long-term, and Airbus is very cognisant of public perception of eVTOLs flying above people’s heads to transport executives to and from an airport.

It has, therefore, identified the EMS (Emergency Medical Services) as its first use case. It has engaged with Europe’s most digitally aware country, Estonia, to create an end-to-end optimized emergency service called LifeSaver.

Airbus is one of the few OEMs that is perfectly honest with its eVTOL performance, speed of 65kts, and range of 43nm, a fraction of other OEMs’ claims.

The CitryAirbus NG is, therefore, the close-range component of this system, which has unique features by being quiet and environmentally friendly (no gas turbine exhaust and noise like from a helicopter). Its drawback is load capability (no stretchers) and range. So the eVTOL is a complement to a helicopter fleet.

The approach shows how the eVTOL forms part of something larger, important, and end-to-end optimized; the saving of people’s lives where the first hour makes all the difference in survivability.

Speaking at a press briefing to unveil the initiative at the Aircraft Interiors Expo in Hamburg today, vice-president of the manufacturer’s cabin & cargo programme, Andre Schneider explained: ”Airspace Link is a multi-layered and flexible approach, which starts with the intelligent core management platform – ICMP…. [a] digital backbone covering the cabin management system as well as other layers.”

The second “brick” of the ecosystem is the Internet of Things service that enables the system to connect the different elements within the cabin such as overhead bins, galleys, seats and life vests.

Airbus says this enables services for optimisation of ancillary revenues, passenger experience and operational efficiency.

“We will also have what we call simply the ‘app store’ that will host various applications for passengers as well as for airlines,” Schneider adds.

He compares Airspace Link to “a flying smartphone”. Schneider says: ”It’s about bringing the potential of the technology we use on the ground to the air. The flexible end-to-end system enables us to connect all the data and unleash all the potential that we see in the market, and generate efficiencies, ancillary revenues and a better passenger experience.”

The system will enable passengers to personalise their journey - from ordering meals in advance, reserving overhead bin space, and applying their preferences to other aspects of their travel plans - and will allow the airline and flight crew access to this data. As a result, the carrier can potentially make more-conscious decisions that could cut down on waste as well as CO2 emissions, Airbus says.

That system will connect with the ground. The air-to-ground solution will provide broadband connectivity using radio-telephony transmission to be tailored for regional operations.

In addition, HBCplus or high-bandwidth satellite connectivity, “aims to become the one agnostic, supplier-furnished equipment (SFE) cross-programme connectivity platform, capable of hosting multiple satcom providers”, Airbus says.

The HBCplus system’s first managed service provider will be Inmarsat, while Safran Passenger Innovations will provide the equipment and lead the hardware integration.

“We are excited to offer airlines a new connectivity service solution that will provide improved speed and reliability for passenger experience and more flexibility,” Schneider says. “HBCplus is as simple as it is revolutionary.”

Entry into service of the Ka-band satellite communications solution is planned for 2024 while the Ku-band will be introduced at a later date, Airbus adds.",Airbus unveils digital ‘ecosystem’ to drive efficiencies and passenger experience

When Sienna Miller arrived on the set of Extrapolations for the first day of filming in October 2021, a Native American shaman came to bless the grounds. There were no printed signs directing her where to go, or stacks of paper scripts available for producers to scribble their notes in the margins. Instead, there were clothing racks filled with thrifted and vintage garments sustainably sourced by the costume department, water stations for refilling nonplastic bottles, compostable plates and utensils, and plant-based craft services. It was the greenest set the actress says she’s ever been on.

“It was really environmentally conscious, and that was a treat,” says Miller. “I’ve been on sets with bamboo stools, but nothing to the degree that this was.”

That difference was intentional on the part of Scott Z. Burns, writer, director and creator of the new Apple TV+ series, and executive producers Dorothy Fortenberry and Media Res’ Michael Ellenberg.

“Dorothy and I, along with Media Res and Apple, felt that if we were going to make this show, we needed to try and make it in the way that the subject matter required of us,” says Burns.

All filming took place throughout New York City’s five boroughs, drastically reducing the project’s carbon footprint. But the greatest success of the production, which employed the help of Green Spark Group, a consulting firm that trains filmmakers on how to reduce their environmental impact during production, was simply demonstrating what’s possible when it comes to how we engage with the Earth and with each another.

Which is precisely the point of Extrapolations. Rather than fixate on hypotheticals about what the planet might be like if humans continue on our current path or depict a distant, apocalyptic-like universe, the eight-episode drama drops viewers in near-future societies around the world where its characters’ entire relationship to one another revolves around the climate issues many believe we still have the luxury to ignore. And that, in and of itself, is terrifying, says Yara Shahidi, another member of the star-studded cast.

“I think that this series asks a question in a really helpful way, which is, As much as you may think of it as an extreme imagining of the future, is it really all that extreme? Is it really all that unrealistic?”

Daveed Diggs in Extrapolations Courtesy of Apple TV+

Extrapolations begins in the year 2037 with climate activists protesting Alpha Industries, a tech company that claims economies will fail if corporations such as theirs aren’t allowed to develop technologies that will raise average temperatures more than 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels — which scientists say is the cutoff to avoid climate catastrophe — in the short term in order to remedy ecological issues in the long term. The argument sets the stage for the theme of environment versus enterprise that plays out in the series.

Kit Harington plays Alpha CEO Nicholas Bilton. “He’s obviously shaped around a few different people in our consciousness right now,” says Harington. “You could pick any one of those kinds of tech billionaires and decide that’s who he’s based on. But really, he’s his own invention. It’s this idea of someone who is ultra-capitalist and very motivated by the free market and believes that they can save the world through capitalism and all of the issues that come with it.”

It’s also during this episode that audiences are introduced to two of the characters who’ll humanize the threat of environmental calamity: newly appointed youth Rabbi Marshall Zucker (Daveed Diggs) and marine biologist Rebecca Shearer (Miller).

“The fame of the cast was important because we wanted characters and actors that the audience would immediately connect to and feel for,” says Ellenberg. “We wanted to collapse the distance from this issue, and with these famous actors you’re there automatically.”

Episode two, “Whale Fall,” set in 2046, finds Shearer in Cali, Colombia, working as a species archivist for a company called Menagerie 2100. She’s developed a relationship with Eve, the last humpback whale on earth, who’s on a forlorn quest to find a mate after losing all four of her children. She shares this desire with Shearer, who’s able to communicate with Eve by assigning her the voice of her late mother, played by Meryl Streep.

“It was extraordinary to watch her work because she can be having a laugh one minute and then suddenly, she gives the greatest emotional performance you’ve ever seen take place and it’s so grounded in truth,” Miller says of Streep. “Because she’s so open and available, it just inspires something in return.”

The thread of parenthood and loss is personal to Burns, whose passion for saving humpback whales dates back to the second grade when he first helped raise money for the cause.

“I think the fact that my father was dying while I was writing that episode made me think a lot about my childhood and about saying goodbye and the idea of, What would it be like to do an exit interview with the last whale?” he says. “What would they say about us?”

In the midst of her grief, Shearer’s also managing 9-year-old son Ezra’s “summer heart,” an illness that requires him to limit his time outdoors. It’s one of several presently fictitious, yet futuristically plausible conditions brought on by global warming — along with “heat rage” and even earlier onset dementia — that shows up in the series.

“We talked to different scientists and experts about potential realities,” explains Fortenberry. “We asked, ‘How will climate change affect agriculture? How will it affect real estate? How will it affect cities? How will it affect politics?’ What we were able to do was come up with potential worlds that really unfolded in ways that surprised us.”

One such world is that of adult Ezra (Tahar Rahim), now living in London in the year 2066, which is explored in episode six, titled “Lola.” Facing cognitive decline, having outlived his summer heart diagnosis, Ezra relies on a technology known as “Cache Cloud” to keep his most precious memories alive. However, when the cost of the service increases after an earthquake causes the servers to crash, he’s forced to make difficult decisions about which moments to preserve.

It’s through his work with a personnel application known as Pack that he meets Natasha (Gemma Chan), a single mother who uses the platform to provide a father figure for her daughter after her biological dad disappears. Using technology and his command of multiple languages, Ezra is able to assume the appearance of different individuals whom he’s hired to impersonate for various purposes, from human connection to confessing wrongdoings. With most clients, the job is merely a task to check off his daily to-do list, but he finds himself forming a bond with Natasha.

“They’re grieving, they’ve both lost their respective loves of their lives, they’re yearning for connection. and, really, against the odds, they’re falling for each other,” says Chan. “I found it really interesting, this idea that in society at that time, everything will have become so divided and fragmented that we’re connecting in this kind of way.”

There’s a desperation that comes over Ezra, however, when no amount of money or technology proves sufficient to keep his memories safe, with Cache Cloud servers continuing to overheat as temperatures soar to 2.32°C above pre-industrial levels. Ultimately, he’s forced to assess what he’s sacrificing to cling to a life that’s no longer his.

“One of the themes of the episode is about letting go and being in the present and that conflict that we all have — whether we’re looking too much into the future or still trapped by the past — of, How can we be completely present and focused on now?” adds Chan. “I think that’s relevant to your romantic life, but also every area of your life.”

Beyond depicting how climate change could upend individual lives on an intimate level, the series also zooms out to the larger, geopolitical landscape. Ecocide — widespread, long-term and severe destruction of the natural environment that’s brought on by either deliberate or negligent human action — is a concept that originated in the 1970s following the Vietnam War. While 10 nations have domestic laws criminalizing ecocide, only one of which — France — is a Western country, there’s currently no international law that bans the practice in peacetime. In Extrapolations, world leaders can no longer afford to overlook how the devastation brought on by increasing global temperatures affects countries in disparate ways.

In episode one, representatives from Algeria and Palestine make pleas to France for access to water, which they argue will also slow the increase in refugee migration. In episode five, set in Mumbai in the year 2059, a nationwide drought resulting from extreme temperatures has rendered stolen goods from the Svalbard Global Seed Vault in the Arctic useless. The predicament calls into question whether the illegal practice of geoengineering, foreshadowed in the prior episode, would be justified if it could bring back the rain needed to germinate the unmarked seeds, even if it played into the hands of controversial billionaire inventor Gita Mishra (Indira Varma).

All the while, Alpha Industries continues to develop technologies that Bilton argues satisfy the basic human desire for convenience.

“So as far as he’s concerned, he’s trying to do right by everyone,” Harington explains. “He thinks his company is the company to help the emerging climate crisis. The trouble is that, like with anyone who spends their life at the top of a company such as that, things get distorted in his mind and money enters in an unhealthy way into his motivation.”

It’s that acknowledged propensity to place comfort above climate concerns that gives audiences an opportunity to take a look at their own choices. (In one scene, a government official confesses, “I feel like I traded the future for the present.”) It’ll be an international court, however, and not individuals’ own consciences, that will decide the cost of doing so.

“If God made humans in his image, why do they suck? Or did we just evolve into sucking?” a precocious preteen (Neska Rose) asks Rabbi Zucker as they stand in the middle of a synagogue in Miami, wearing rain boots due to the persistent sea level rise in episode three, “The Fifth Question.”

“I wanted to write something that was broadly about what we do in society when the stories and the myths that we tell each other at home or in church or in synagogue begin to fray at the edges. Because the world that exists in those stories is also fraying at the edges,” explains Burns.

The episode, which stars Diggs and David Schwimmer as two practicing Jewish men with conflicting agendas for the climate-displaced, is inspired by the Coen brothers’ 2009 black comedy A Serious Man and is one of several ways Burns plays with various genres throughout the series. Episode four, “Face of God,” starring Edward Norton, which Burns co-wrote with novelist Dave Eggers, draws from Sidney Lumet’s 1964 Cold War thriller Fail Safe, written by Walter Bernstein. Burns likens episode seven, which he crafted with playwright Bess Wohl, to Edward Albee’s 1966 play, Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?

“I remember saying to Michael and Dorothy, ‘You should be able to take a story as fundamental as Romeo and Juliet and ask, so how does that change in a climate-changed world?’ — because all the stories that we know were written for a climate that no longer exists.”

In the penultimate episode, “The Going Away Party,” set in San Francisco in 2068, Sylvie (Marion Cotillard) invites Nic (Tobey Maguire) and his much younger girlfriend, Elodie (Eiza González), over for a New Year’s Eve feast with her husband, Auggie (Forest Whitaker), that costs them six carbon credits. It’s more than they can afford, which is why Sylvie, in her floor-length formal gown, tells Anna, the help she’s hired for the night — who has to wear an oxygen mask as she treks through the street to make it to the couple’s walk-up apartment — not to expect a tip.

During dinner, Auggie reveals he’s won a lottery that allows members of society’s upper echelon to upload themselves into a digitized cloud to be awakened at a later date when the world is in a happier and healthier state. He shares his desire to take advantage of the opportunity without first consulting his wife — an indicator of the state of their marriage. What follows is a meltdown on the part of Sylvie that’s so impetuous you can’t help but laugh as it unfolds onscreen.

“That’s her strength,” González says of Nicole Holofcener, who directed the episode. “She really understands how to bring out the comedy and absurdity of certain situations.”

Still, there’s an equal level of realism in uncovering how interpersonal relationships will be affected by individual responses to the new way of living brought on by climate change.

“What I loved about the episode is it allowed for deep conversations on-set,” adds González. “Marion comes from a completely different culture growing up in France, and me in Mexico, and with Forest and Tobey there’s all of these different years, times and places in the world, and we had to figure out, How does that intertwine? These conversations really bled into our lives on a daily basis.”

The final episode of season one of Extrapolations opens with a scene of Grammy Award-winning Blues musician Ben Harper singing a pared-down version of Marvin Gaye’s “Mercy Mercy Me (The Ecology)” onstage. The year is 2070, the average global temperature has increased by 2.59°C, and the reality predicted in the song’s 1971 lyrics have been fully actualized.

Where did all the blue skies go?

Poison is the wind that blows

“It’s important that people learn that Marvin Gaye’s ‘Mercy Mercy Me’ is kind of the first song that brought awareness to this issue,” says Burns. “Once you understand that, you begin to learn that this issue shows up in people’s lives in different ways, and it’s not surprising that frontline communities often experience this in ways that aren’t on the weather report.”

Burns’ words speak to the personalization of environmental issues that defines Extrapolations and underlines its effectiveness. The hope, says Chan, is that “people are moved, entertained and perhaps a little bit scared” after watching the series.

The creators also want viewers to be galvanized to act. “When I describe the series, people are like, ‘OK, so do we fix it or don’t we?’ ‘Do we win or do we lose?’ And that’s not the question,” says Fortenberry. “It’s not a binary. It’s an ongoing, unfolding event that we’re all going to be living through, and we’re all going to be influencing, and there will be challenges and opportunities at every turn.”

In fact, many of them are already here.

“My daughter watched the trailer and said, ‘The reality is, this is not far away,’ adds Miller. “It’s probably a decade too late that we’re making this show, but how wonderful that there’s a platform to tell it.”","The Making of Star-Studded Climate Drama ‘Extrapolations’: “I Hope People Are Moved, Entertained and Perhaps a Little Bit Scared”"

The wild custard apple is one of a number of “forgotten food crops” identified as being potentially instrumental in adapting future food systems to climate change.

Researchers at Scotland’s Rural College (SRUC), the World Vegetable Center, World Agroforestry and partner institutions have modelled how nutrient-rich forgotten food crops – crops not promoted in recent decades with the dominance of major staples – could help diversify future food systems to make them more climate-resilient and healthier.

The research, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA, considered the case of sub-Saharan Africa, where the need to support food and nutritional security is high and where there any many potential forgotten food crops that could be more widely grown. Like elsewhere in the world, Africa’s climate is getting hotter, and weather events like floods and droughts are increasing, and this means that agriculture must adapt.

Climate niche modelling was used to prioritise 58 forgotten food crops from seven different food groups including fruits, leafy vegetables, pulses and cereals that have the highest potential to contribute to healthy climate-proof cropping systems of the African major staples of maize, rice, cassava and yams to the year 2070.

Dr Ian Dawson, a reader at SRUC, explained: “Africa already has massive problems in achieving sufficient nutritious food supply, and climate change is expected to make the situation a lot worse. Colleagues at the World Vegetable Center and World Agroforestry are committed to supporting the diversification of Africa’s food systems with a range of healthy foods.”

Lead author Maarten van Zonneveld from the World Vegetable Center said: “Of the 58 prioritised forgotten food crops, many are annuals and tree fruits rich in Vitamin A and C, and a large number are vegetables high in Vitamin A, iron, folate and zinc. Our study shows that in most locations where major staples are currently grown in sub-Saharan Africa, one or more forgotten food crops from the different food groups will be suitable for cultivation under 2070 climate conditions and can diversify major staples to support more nutrient-rich diets.”

Dawson added: “Although our paper looks at future food systems for Africa, there is no reason why similar climate-niche modelling methods should not be applied to forgotten foods in other parts of the world, and that includes Europe and the UK. Already, the UK is thinking about how to introduce or reintroduce unusual legume, cereal and vegetable crops into production, to reduced greenhouse gas emissions by providing alternative sources of protein to meat, and to create healthier diets. So these moves would also help adapt our food system to the future climate we anticipate.

“The special thing about our current research was that we not only modelled crop distributions, but we looked at the nutritional value of the crops and therefore more directly how their production affects diets, which is a crucial factor in support of micronutrient supply ‘beyond calories’ that current staple crops provide. In the UK recently, we have seen the problems of getting access to healthful salad crops, for example.

“As we note in the paper, the climate modelling we have done is of course only an initial step in supporting food system diversification, and many other considerations are needed to design future food systems and put these designs into practice. We need to work with producers and consumers to find out what works in bringing about useful change, but our modelling is a useful step on the way.”",Custard apple ‘among climate change solutions’ in Africa

When I first heard about the new Apple TV+ show “Extrapolations,” I assumed that the best thing about the series would be that Daveed Diggs plays a rabbi.

To be sure, the show as a whole looked great from the outset. “Extrapolations” boasts an ensemble cast full of star-power and a narrative that interweaves personal stories of the near-future with that of environmental catastrophe due to climate change. But I mean, come on. It’s Daveed Diggs as a rabbi. What could possibly be better than that?

Reader, I’m now here to tell you that I was only half-right.

While I was correct in that Daveed Diggs as Rabbi Marshall Zucker is spectacular, it’s just the tip of a very compelling (and hopefully not melting) iceberg. For an incredibly well done show, the whole of Zucker’s episode is the absolute pinnacle for me, succeeding in both the performances of its actors and its powerful telling of a futuristic Passover story.

Set during Passover 2047, “The Fifth Question” takes place 10 years after the series premiere. In the first episode, viewers had met a newly ordained Rabbi Zucker. The passionate Zucker had his heart set on serving a congregation in Tel Aviv and advocating for tikkun olam — healing the world. During his time there, we even see him quoting Elie Wiesel from the bimah in support of action to save the planet. But clearly, things have not worked out the way he intended. Instead, the rabbi is serving Temple Israel in his hometown of Miami, which requires pandering to public officials in hopes that the Department of Sea Level Mitigation will zone the synagogue to be saved from sea-level rise and flooding. “This year, my prayer is simple: that our leaders in Tallahassee will save this building and that next year, we will all be here together in Miami,” Rabbi Zucker announces to his congregation, in passionless contrast to his previous sermons.

Enter Alana Goldblatt (played masterfully by actress Neska Rose). The socially conscious tween, a perfect mix of the haggadah’s wise and wicked child, begins preparing for her bat mitzvah with Rabbi Zucker. But more often than not, their conversations turn into tense interrogations, with Alana questioning the rabbi about whether climate change is an expression of divine anger towards human sin. (Alana has a front row seat to this kind of sin thanks to dad Harris, a callous businessman played by David Schwimmer, who profits on climate disaster.)

“Why else would God be doing this?” Alana asks one day after Shabbat services.

Rabbi Zucker counters, “Doing what?”

“The sea level rise, the droughts, the refugees, the diseases. He’s angry, he has to be,” Alana responds.

Try as he might, Zucker never quite has the right answer to give Alana. And tensions are only increasing.

First, Harris bribes officials at the Department of Sea Level Mitigation, with Zucker’s knowledge. (Allowing Harris to do this isn’t an action Rabbi Zucker takes lightly, later having a stress dream in which he and Alana sing and dance to “Singin’ In the Rain” in the flooding sanctuary.) As a result the synagogue is saved, but it’s at the expense of a homeless shelter full of climate-displaced peoples when a massive hurricane is just about to make landfall in Miami. Then, Alana’s grandfather (Judd Hirsch) dies due to a nasty mosquito bite, and her dad is arrested for bribery during the shiva. Horrified by the state of the world and infuriated by the adults around her, Alana turns her bat mitzvah — and her Sodom and Gomorrah Torah portion — as a diatribe.

“Were they selfish? Were they cruel? Were they any different than us?” Alana asks her close family and friends, revealing that, tired of his behavior, she called the cops on her dad and is predicting that the category 4 storm will “wipe the planet clean” at God’s behest. Alana also plays a video she found of Zucker’s Elie Wiesel climate sermon for the crowd, reminding him of the kind of person he once was.

Deeply impacted by Alana’s own sermon, Rabbi Zucker resigns and goes home to wait out the storm. But he’s not gone for long. When the seawall in Biscayne Bay in breached, Zucker risks his life to return to the completely flooded synagogue to save the Torah scrolls. With the help of a plumber named Julia, Zucker carries the scrolls to the roof, in the torrential downpour, where a helicopter saves them all.

Flashing forward a few weeks or months, Zucker and Julia are now serving food in a displaced persons camp in a stadium in Tallahassee. “I guess we’re all homeless now, rabbi,” one of the unhoused people from the shelter in Miami quips as Zucker serves him a plate. “I’m sorry, Elijah,” the rabbi responds. (Elijah!!! Get it?!)

The episode ends with Alana approaching the table, revealing that she survived the storm as well. She asks the rabbi again why God seemingly won’t intervene with climate change, allowing humans to suffer. This time, Zucker references an interaction when Moses asks God why humans are allowed to suffer, to which God essentially answers, “I’d tell you, but you wouldn’t understand because you’re a human and I’m God.”

“That’s it? That’s the answer?” Alana resists.

“Being human? Yeah, it has to be,” Zucker responds.

Finally rendered question-less, Alana joins Rabbi Zucker to serve food as the pair hum “Singin’ in the Rain.”

Last year, I collected the 18 best Passover episodes on television for Hey Alma. This year, I can confidently say that “The Fifth Question” far surpasses all of the episodes on that list — even “A Rugrats Passover.”

This year, at Passover seder, as I dip my fingers in the wine and list the plagues of Egypt, I’ll no longer see them as metaphorical, biblical afflictions but rather as analogous to environmental collapse. When I say “Next year in Jerusalem” I will wonder when my family will be displaced from New York City by rising sea levels and where they will go in generations to come. And I’ll remember, in the words of Rabbi Marshall Zucker, that “being human,” or taking action, is the only way to liberate our planet from impending climate catastrophe.",Apple TV+’s ‘Extrapolations’ Imagines Passover During Future Climate Disaster

11-year-old environmentalist Mason Blomberg, star of the Apple TV+ series JANE, has received the invitation of a lifetime. Mason has been personally chosen by world renowned environmentalist Jane Goodall to be an ambassador for the Jane Goodall Institute's Roots & Shoots Program.

Mason Blomberg is a born conservationist. Since he was very young, he has looked up to Dr. Jane Goodall, and at the age of seven, he became a vegetarian himself because he ""didn't want to be the reason animals die."" A talented actor as well, it was no surprise when he was offered a starring role in the Jane Goodall inspired series JANE now streaming on Apple TV+ just in time for Earth Day.

""I really care about the environment and saving animals, so to be part of a show that is sharing this message was a dream come true. Jane Goodall has always been an idol of mine so being on this show not only allowed me to do my favorite thing, which is acting, but also share a message I believe in - what more could a kid ask for?""

On the series JANE, two best friends, Jane and David (Blomberg) set out on imaginative adventures to help protect wild animals all around the world. It was a dream come true for Mason Blomberg who was able to travel to amazing places while learning firsthand about the importance of conservation and protection for the Earth.

The Jane Goodall Institute was founded in 1977 to ensure that her life's work and vision will ""continue to mobilize the collective power of individual action to save the natural world we all share"". In 1991, The Roots & Shoots Program was created for preschool to university age participants to ""identify the problems in their communities while becoming the compassionate citizens our planet needs"".

Through the series and his ambassadorship, Mason will be working and interacting with children from around the world to spread the message of Dr. Jane Goodall: ""Only if we understand, will we care. Only if we care, will we help. Only if we help, can they be saved.""

Srinagar, Mar 27: Farmers in Kashmir valley are worried about the early blooming of apple trees, which is an unusual phenomenon that experts attribute to global warming and fluctuating temperatures. Despite intermittent rainfall, the rising temperatures in March have concerned orchardists and environmentalists in the valley.

According to Dr. Tariq Rasool, Associate Professor of Plant Pathology at SKUAST-K, proper temperatures are required for fertilization or pollination. When temperatures decrease or it rains, it affects pollination and flowering. Last year, Kashmir witnessed a dry and hot March, and this year the bloom has come out very early. Dr. Tariq stated that there is no normal weather in Kashmir due to climate change and fluctuating temperatures over the past several years.

Dr. Tariq suggests that the government and SKUAST-K should issue weather-based advisories and decision support systems for the management of diseases, pests, and all agricultural and nutrient management. The climate change and fluctuating temperatures will have a definite impact on the horticulture industry. Generally, crop failures happen in Kashmir orchards due to bad or adverse weather conditions. When there is bloom and all of a sudden there is a decrease in temperature and rains occur, there are chances of crop failure.

Abdul Quds Beigh, Horticulture Development Officer of the Horticulture Department Kashmir, said that the early blooming of flowers has left farmers and apple growers concerned. He suggested that farmers change the spray schedule according to the dip in temperature and the stage of growth in their orchards. When the temperature dips, there would be less pollination in apple trees.

Director of the Indian Meteorological Centre Kashmir, Sonam Lotus, stated that this year has been warmer and witnessed a rise in temperature as compared to previous years, especially in February and March. He attributed the reason for the warm winter to less frequency of western disturbances, adding that the temperature is fluctuating. In previous years, J&K would witness good snow in February and March, but this year that did not happen. This year, the valley is witnessing an early spring.","Amid climate change concerns, early bloom of apple trees worries farmers"

Across two long days, unlikely allies will transport a secret package that many other interested parties are gunning for.

Extrapolations is essentially an omnibus series about the future, as seen through the eyes of people affected by climate change. That means every episode bears a distinct identity. In this week’s installment, entitled “2059 Part II: Nightbirds,” the creative team hits upon something partly neo-realist, partly Bourne-inspired action and party speculative fiction. It’s the most consistent and engrossing episode of the very patchy show so far.

Extrapolations recap: ‘2059 Part II: Nightbirds’

Season 1, episodes 5: We’ve seen Gaurav (played by Adarsh Gourav) before. He was on the street when the private security fleet owned by Nicholas Bilton (Kit Harington) blew up the plane of would-be environmental terrorist Gita (Indira Varma). She had threatened to release calcium carbonate all over the world, forcing the hands of millions to combat climate change.

Gaurav had no idea about any of that, of course. He’s a small-time hood in Mumbai. He’s on a job now, and he’s been paired with the foul-mouthed, short-tempered, sarcastic Neel (Gaz Choudhry), who immediately proves a thorn in Gaurav’s side. They have to get to Varanasi, which is 12 hours by truck, so they need to leave now.

Neel’s nursing a breakup. His girlfriend left him after he lost his leg, and he wants to talk about it, along with everything else in his life. Gaurav usually works alone and does not want to talk. Mumbai is a dangerous place to live, even if you don’t factor in Gaurav’s criminal side hustles. The air isn’t breathable, and everyone has to fight for hits of oxygen on the street. Birds can’t fly during the day anymore, so they crash into cars a lot more often.

Gaurav turned to crime when his family’s farm collapsed and his father killed himself. He doesn’t have a lot of hope for the future. Neel does, though, and he tries desperately to get his new companion to get some.

And the contraband cargo is …

They don’t get too far before the police shake them down, beating them pretty badly, but they’ve got a pretty good cover story for the stolen goods in the back. Unfortunately, the cops don’t want to hear it. Somehow, Neel manages to get the drop on the police and shoot his way out.

They make it to the first checkpoint, then trade cars and pick up a new passenger, a genetic scientist (played by Waris Ahluwalia, always a welcome sight) who was hit by a burst of radiation sickness. Now he’s only lucid a few minutes a day. They also learn what kind of contraband they’re carrying: seeds. The trouble is, someone else (Keri Russell) is looking for them. And she doesn’t seem like she’ll be as careless as the corrupt cops.

Neel makes a foolhardy decision to help a little boy (Dhruv Jagan Badireddy) in danger of dying from intense sun poisoning — and almost dies for his altruism. The boy’s family takes in the three travelers for the night. That’s when Ms. Someone Else shows up and a bloody gunfight ensues. The seeds are safe … at great cost. The question is, will it have been worth it?

Solid directing and writing trump a preachy cli-fi message

I didn’t know the name Richie Mehta before it showed up under the “directed by” credit in this week’s episode of Extrapolations, and that made for a pleasant surprise. Mehta’s been making what sound like dependable, solid movies in a number of genres for the last two decades. And I think his not having the ego of some other directors means that he really just tells this story with as little nonsense as possible.

Prolific playwright Rajiv Joseph scripts this week’s episode. And though he occasionally reaches for theatrical devices and over-enunciates his themes, compared to the previous entries in this series, he might as well be Samuel Beckett. Together, the two men make something that just flies to its violent outcome.

The touchstones were likely not simply show creator Scott Z. Burns’ Bourne movie script, but that’s basically the territory we’re in, with a little neo-neo-realism thrown in. (It gets nowhere near as dark, but the idea of a nighttime odyssey into darkness and violence reminded of Brillante Mendoza’s Kinatay, a movie I’m sure at least nine other people have seen.)

All hail Keri Russell

The violence was quite effectively utilized as well. Keri Russell (who you might have seen in Felicity or The Americans) showing up and just laying waste to folks was quite unexpected. Extrapolations isn’t necessarily afraid of going dark, but there’s metaphorical bleakness (which could very easily have been the title of this show) and then there’s the sight of people bleeding to death in an impoverished village.

The key to this episode working while the others flail and drown is that it’s tangentially related to the show’s broader themes at best. Yes, Neel’s optimism is meant to be a kind of stand-in for the creators’ worldview (and spoiler alert: he isn’t rewarded for it). But the global climate change stuff this week acts merely as set dressing. The protagonists could have been hauling gold or radium or something. Doesn’t matter.

Admittedly, this dilutes the moral of the story. But I’ll take it over being hit in the head with the least-subtle version of “Hey people, we’re doomed! Do something!” like I am every other week by Extrapolations.

Half of those executives were from the US.Chinese officials' meetings with foreign representatives have sent a clear signal on China's unswerving commitment to opening-up, and is testimony to China's increasing role as a magnet for foreign investors. Beijing's concrete welcoming gesture is also a divergence from Washington, which has spared no effort to suppress Chinese companies in the US, even at the cost of sinking its own national reputation, experts said.Wang said China will unswervingly promote high-level opening-up, and steadily expand institutional opening-up with regard to rules, regulations, management and standards. China is willing to provide a good and stable business environment for foreign companies, including Apple, to invest and operate in the country, according to the official website of the Ministry of Commerce.Other US executives included Corning Inc CEO Wendell P Weeks, Procter & Gamble CEO Jon Moeller, US-China Business Council president Craig Allen, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla and Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon.During his meetings with foreign business executives, Wang expressed his willingness to provide a good environment and services for companies from all over the world to develop in China.China's economic contributions to the world are expected to rank No.1 in the world this year, so it is natural for global executives to fly to one of the world's fastest-growing markets and scale up investment, Tian Yun, former vice director of the Beijing Economic Operation Association, told the Global Times on Monday.""In terms of cost controls, China - with controllable inflation - also offers the ideal option for global companies to manufacture price-competitive products,"" Tian noted.China has been committed to optimizing the business environment and creating convenient conditions for investors in recent years. For example, during the COVID-19 epidemic, the Chinese government established a special team to help foreign companies solve difficulties in raw materials and labor in a timely manner.These efforts have been welcomed by foreign companies.According to a survey by the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, foreign-funded enterprises were generally satisfied with China's business environment in the fourth quarter of 2022 - 90.2 percent were ""satisfied"" or ""very satisfied"" with conditions for renting business space and paying taxes.Zheng Shanjie, the newly designated chairman of the National Development and Reform Commission, China's top economic planner, stressed that China welcomes foreign investment and is willing to share its development achievements.""Walking with China means communicating with opportunities, investing in China means investing in the future,"" Zheng said at the CDF on Sunday.China continues to adopt a welcoming gesture to foreign investors and treats them on an equal footing, a further draw for global firms.Observers said that it is in stark contrast to the US, which has been plotting a ""political witch hunt"" against companies with a Chinese background, ranging from TikTok to Huawei.The US Congressional hearing on TikTok was politically manipulated to cover its real purpose of robbing the profits of the firm from China, which reflects mounting US hegemony and bullying of firms with a Chinese background, experts said.Mao Ning, the spokesperson of the Foreign Ministry, on Monday blasted US' presumption of guilt against TikTok without any proof.""Technical problems should be resolved in a professional way. Unreasonable crackdowns on others will not make the US stronger,"" Mao said.","Chinese Commerce Minister meets with Apple CEO, promising better, more transparent business environment"

In the second episode of Apple TV Plus’s new climate drama “Extrapolations,” a scientist sits in an underwater base, communicating with a humpback whale. The year is 2046 — all of the “Extrapolations” episodes are named after a year in a future, brutally warmed climate — and the whale appears to be the last of her kind alive on the Earth. Humans have, conveniently, learned to translate whale songs, and the humpback speaks e.e. cummings-esque phrases in the voice of Meryl Streep. “Have you caused some of us to fall?” she clicks and whistles.

“No,” the scientist, Rebecca Shearer (played valiantly by Sienna Miller), responds quickly. “No, I would never hurt you.”

Implicit, of course, is that while Rebecca herself may not have hurt the humpback whale, humanity as a whole — with its fossil fuel-burning, ecosystem-destroying ways — did. It’s one of many lines in “Extrapolations,” the limited-run series from showrunner Scott Z. Burns, that feels almost painfully on-the-nose. Earlier in the same episode, Rebecca, comforting her young son (Joaopaulo Malheiro), who is suffering from a warming-induced medical condition known as “summer heart,” says: “The world made you sick. Because we made the world sick.”

While many Hollywood actors and actresses — Leonardo di Caprio, Jane Fonda — participate in climate activism of various kinds, the subject has rarely been made into a hit film or TV. The genre is dominated by apocalypse narratives — from “The Day After Tomorrow” to the more recent meteorite satire/allegory “Don’t Look Up” from director Adam McKay. Climate change has historically seemed too diffuse, too scientific and too political to translate into a successful feature film or TV series.

So “Extrapolations,” as a star-studded drama series focused entirely on the issue, paves new ground. Burns, who is best-known as the writer of the scarily prescient pandemic film “Contagion,” has a long history of interest in the environment and climate change. He once worked for two advocacy groups, the Sierra Club and the Natural Resources Defense Council, and helped produce Al Gore’s PowerPoint lecture-turned-documentary “An Inconvenient Truth.”

But even as the show makes history, its moral framework feels a bit too familiar. While each episode has a distinct storyline and characters, the good people are always deeply wholesome, the villains clearly villainous. There is a teenage activist who exhorts politicians at the 46th U.N. climate conference to finally take action; there are insufferable, whiny billionaires who see the world — and even the rapidly melting Arctic — as possibilities only for development.

Kit Harington of “Game of Thrones” fame plays the obviously evil Nicholas Bilton, CEO of a Google-esque company that owns everything from an AI search engine to cheap desalination technology. Edward Norton, on the other hand, is slightly more nuanced as a well-meaning climate scientist hoping to save the world from solar geoengineering.

Burns envisioned the series as a climate-change version of “Dekalog,” the 10-part miniseries from Polish director Krzysztof Kieślowski, in which each episode covers one of the Ten Commandments. The climate version of this moral code seems similarly stark, although perhaps not deeply morally illuminating: Thou shalt not drive species to extinction. Thou shalt not inject aerosols into the air to cool the planet.

In “The Great Derangement: Climate Change and the Unthinkable,” one of Burns’s inspirations for the series, the Indian writer and scholar Amitav Ghosh argued that Western fiction’s focus on the individual has held literature back from exploring the profound and unequal impacts of climate change. Burns and his co-showrunner, Dorothy Fortenberry, argue that film and TV have their own version of the same problem: Climate apocalypses create immediate drama and character-level tension. The messy middle ground — the not-quite apocalypse, the slow burn, if you will — is harder to turn into marketable entertainment.

In “Extrapolations,” that messy middle ground sometimes feels too educational. Climate content in any form can feel a bit like eating your vegetables, and the series does not escape that trap. The first episode alternates between images of raging wildfires and debates at the U.N. climate conference — as journalists who have covered such meetings know, they are hardly a place of great television dramas. In one scene, a rich corporate executive puts on a VR headset and is confronted by visions of the fires. He takes it off in annoyance. The question is whether viewers will do the same.

The most effective moments in the series show people experiencing planetary warming as routine, making drastic adjustments feel like a matter of course. A group of people rides on a boat through the melted Arctic, wearing nothing but thin windbreakers. A boy learns that the weather forecast is “an orange day” thanks to endless wildfires and heat. Congregants sit in the pews of a Miami synagogue, their feet clad in heavy rain boots and resting in several inches of water.

Later episodes are stronger. One episode, which cinematically covers the dangers and trade-offs of solar geoengineering, is a thoughtful exploration of the different ways people might try to save the world. And as the show progresses into the future, its science fiction elements begin to carry the plot.

But there is still a simplicity to Extrapolations’ story arc: comeuppance for the evil characters, victory for the good. Climate change, with its collective and yet uneven responsibilities and its manifest unfairness, is more complicated than that. If only it were that simple.

Based in Cupertino, Calif., Apple is the largest tech company measured by revenues: $366 billion in 2021. It was founded in 1976 by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne.

Apple has connected the world through its electronics, and it also trying to better the planet through its sustainability efforts. As such, its goal is carbon neutrality by 2030 and to create products that are also net zero by the same time. Finally, it hopes to ensure its product supply chain only uses renewable electricity by 2030.

Furthermore, it only uses recycled and renewable materials in its products and packaging. It aims to eliminate plastics in its packaging by 2025 and reduce its water impact while making its products and operating its facilities. And it wants to eliminate waste sent to landfills from its corporate facilities and suppliers.

“Across all of these efforts, we never lose sight of our primary mission — working to address the climate crisis,” says Lisa Jackson, vice president of environment and policy for Apple. “It’s an urgent challenge no one company, entity, or individual can tackle alone, and this year, we’re addressing it with more ambition than ever before. In fact, we’ve begun to decouple business growth from emissions as we drive towards our goal of bringing our entire carbon footprint to be net zero by 2030 — including our supply chain and the use of our products.”

Jackson, whose comments appeared in the company’s sustainability statement and who previously served as EPA administrator in the Obama administration, said that Apple’s revenues grew by 33%. At the same time, its net emissions remained flat in 2021. She adds that 213 of its top suppliers are committed to using 100% green energy, and in the last year, Apple doubled its use of renewable power. Additionally, last year, 18% of the materials in Apple products came from recycled sources.

What is Apple doing to fight climate change?

Carbon neutrality is an aggressive goal, especially for a multinational company with operations all over the world. But Apple wants to achieve this by 2030. It also intends to reduce related emissions by 75% using a baseline of 2015. In 2021, it avoided more than 23 million metric tons of emissions and reduced its carbon footprint by 40%. This reduction comports with the goals set by the Paris agreement — to limit warming to 1.5°C.

It attributes this success to efforts and initiatives that had long been underway — things like sourcing all of its renewable electricity for its facilities and using low-carbon materials in products. In 2018, Apple set out to fuel all of its retail stores, offices, and data centers using green energy. In 2020, it expanded its efforts to include business travel and employee commute.

Here’s what else Apple is doing:

— designing products and manufacturing processes to be less carbon-intensive by increasing material and product energy efficiency.

— increasing energy efficiency at its facilities and supply chain by, in part, reducing energy use. This has avoided 0.06 million metric tons of CO2.

— using 100% renewable energy at its facilities. This has avoided 1 million metric tons of CO2.

— scaling up investments in nature-based solutions and restoring ecosystems worldwide.

“Since April 2020, we have been carbon neutral for our corporate emissions, including direct emissions (scope 1), electricity-related emissions (scope 2), as well as emissions from business travel and employee commute (scope 3), the company says. “To reach neutrality, we focused on driving energy efficiency improvements and transitioning our facilities to 100% renewable electricity, which we achieved in 2018. These programs have reduced our scope 1 and scope 2 emissions by 67 percent, even as our business grew.”

Tell us more about your recycling efforts.

The company makes dozens of products and ships tens of millions of products worldwide. Its strategy is to use low-carbon energy and recycled content. For example, by switching to recycled and low-carbon aluminum, its CO2 emissions tied to aluminum have fallen by 68% since 2015. The Ipad now uses 100% recycled aluminum in its enclosure. So does the Apple Watch.

In 2021, Apple released eight products with 20% or more recycled content. It also doubled its use of recycled tungsten, rare earth elements, and cobalt while using for the first time certified recycled gold.

It is using 75% fewer plastics in its packaging compared to 2015. However, the goal is to eliminate plastics in its packaging by 2025. Further, it will banish waste sent to landfill from its corporate offices, data centers, and retail stores.

“We aim to have our products be part of thriving, responsible, circular supply chains — where finite material extraction is replaced by continual recycling and reuse. We’re increasingly sourcing more of the materials we use from circular supply chains drawn from recycled content and renewable resources,” says the sustainability paper.

In the last year:

— 18% of product material came from recycled and renewable sources. “This milestone is part of our broader strategy focusing on 14 materials that account for more than 90 percent of the total product mass shipped to our customers.”

— plastics made up only 4% of packaging.

— 59% of the aluminum came from recycled sources.

— 13% of the cobalt in current products came from certified recycled sources, including end-of-life batteries.

— At least 100 facilities are ‘zero-waste’ while recycling and composting efforts diverted 68% of the company’s waste to landfills.

And water use?

Apple tracks water use at its corporate offices, retail stores, and data centers, which have water management systems. Data centers make up 30% of the company’s water use. It says its supply chain accounts for 99% of its water footprint.

It uses recycled water for irrigation, cooling systems, and toilet flushing. The recycled water comes primarily from municipal treatment plants; less than 5% comes from onsite treatment. It also captures rainwater.","Apple Is Tackling Climate Change by Using Renewables, Increasing Recycling, Limiting Waste"

The net-zero emissions plans of 24 multinational companies are not only largely misleading, but also distract from a failure to cut climate-wrecking emissions in line with the Paris climate goals.

The latest Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor , which is authored by German think tank, the New Climate Institute, paints a picture of private sector obfuscation in regard to meaningful decarbonization.

The report found the climate strategies of 15 of the 24 companies surveyed were of ""low"" or ""very low integrity"" due to inadequate or ambiguous pledges.

Nearly all of the corporations have committed to becoming net-zero or carbon neutral in the next three decades. Net-zero can only be reached after a 90% minimum emissions cut, say the report's authors.

Yet on average, the companies will only reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by about 36%, which is ""wholly insufficient"" to limit temperature rise to 1.5 Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit), said the report.

Just five of the 24 companies — H&M Group, Holcim, Stellantis, Maersk, and Thyssenkrupp — commit to decarbonize their emissions by at least around 90% by their respective net-zero target years.

Claiming carbon neutrality while doing business as usual

Promises of climate neutrality by half of the corporations analyzed – including tech companies Apple, Google and Microsoft, and German postal delivery service Deutsche Post DHL — are highly misleading in that they only refer to 3% of total emissions.

""Quite shockingly,"" the largest share of the companies' own emissions are left out, noted Thomas Day, an analyst at the New Climate Institute and report co-author.

He said the terminology of net zero ""should really mean deep decarbonization to not mislead investors and consumers.""

Only three corporations — shipping company Maersk, and telecommunications firms Vodafone and Deutsche Telekom — commit to deep decarbonization across all their emissions up and down the value chain.

Mercedes-Benz' climate pledges were rated as having ""low"" integrity Image: AP

""This creates a really difficult situation for the handful of companies that are genuinely ambitious and are taking part in the process with more honesty and integrity, because it's impossible for them to distinguish themselves from companies who are greenwashing,"" said Day.

The inadequacy of the pledges is compounded by the fact that two-thirds of the companies plan to rely on offsetting emissions through carbon credits – rather than cutting emissions at the source.

The companies, which are all members of the UN initiative, Race to Zero — whose membership has tripled to nearly 9,000 companies since January 2022, noted the report — commonly use forests and other biological carbon reservoirs to offset their emissions.

However, the report noted that such offsets might be unable to neutralize GHG emissions in the long term if destroyed by forest fires, for example.

Furthermore, two to four planets would be required if all companies were to plan CO2 compensation strategies on a similar scale.

2030 targets won't be met

The inadequacy but also the ambiguity of the longer term net-zero corporate targets is masking the even bigger failure to make immediate emissions cuts in line with 2030 targets, said the authors.

To achieve carbon neutrality by mid-century, the report estimates that companies need to cut emissions 43% by 2030 from 2019 levels.

""On average, these 24 companies commit only 15% emissions reductions by 2030,"" noted Thomas Day. ""So it's much closer to business as usual than it is to where we need to be going.""

Companies are responding to calls from consumers, shareholders and regulators to decarbonize by setting goals and demonstrating their climate leadership.

""[But] the fragmentation of approaches and the general lack of regulation or oversight, means that it is more difficult than ever to distinguish between real climate leadership and unsubstantiated greenwashing,"" according to the report.

Moreover, the ambiguity of these net zero targets is ""actually distracting from the grave insufficiency of short-term targets,"" said Day.

Since the publication of the first Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor a year ago, there has been little progress in general, said the authors.

Only one company with 'adequate' pledges

Of the companies surveyed, German steel giant Thyssen Krupp's climate strategy was rated to have ""moderate"" integrity, but those of Deutsche Post DHL, Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz all had ""low"" integrity.

As in the 2022 edition of the report, Danish multinational Maersk is the only company whose climate strategy had ""adequate"" integrity, in part through investment in alternative fuels.

One of the report's key findings is that intense scrutiny and transparency is vital for ensuring that pledges and claims are credible. Companies must be held accountable if they are not.

This should be the job of regulators who cannot rely on public and shareholder pressure to keep corporations in line with climate targets, said Thomas Day.

""Regulators, international standard setters and companies need to focus with great determination on the integrity of companies' emissions reduction plans up to 2030,"" he said.

""Current corporate plans in no way reflect the urgency for immediate drastic emissions cuts.""

Apple's aggressive iPhone updater cycle has us now conditioned to expect better and faster, but the iPhone 14 launch might change all that.

A couple of things lead to this conclusion.

First, back in March, Apple-watcher Ming-Chi Kuo reported that only the 6.1-inch ‌iPhone 14 Pro‌ and the 6.7-inch ‌iPhone 14 Pro‌ Max would be getting the new A16 chip and that 6.1-inch ‌iPhone 14‌ and the 6.7-inch iPhone 14‌ Max will stick with the A15 chip found in the iPhone 13 line up.

Now this tells us something interesting: The iPhone is no longer limited by processor speed since Apple can bundle the older chip into newer handsets without compromising the experience.

Kuo also mentioned at the same time that all four iPhone 14 handsets would get a RAM bump to 6GB (up from 4GB) and that the Pro and Pro Max versions would also get a RAM upgrade from the existing LPDDR4X to LPDDR5.

And now DigiTimes Asiaseems to corroborate this, claiming that Samsung Electronics, SK Hynix, and Micron Technology are all expecting to see increased sales of LPDDR5 RAM.

So, what will LPDDR5 bring to the iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max?

Well, along with increased performance thanks to increased speed (6400 Mbps vs. 4266 Mbps) and an increased performance thanks to a doubling of the bank density (a maximum of 16 banks vs. 8 banks) compared to LPDDR4X, another massive benefit is better power efficiency because LPDDR5 operates at 1.1V compared to 1.2V for LPDDR4X.

iPhone RAM isn't something that Apple talks about during launches, so either Apple is going to make a big deal of this change, or it's going to be a silent change that Apple is implementing to give the iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max handsets a bigger performance and battery edge over the lower-specification models.",Why would Apple recycle old chips in the new iPhone?

Over the last few months, various OEMs have been busy touting their sustainability credentials. At the launch of its latest foldable smartphones in early August, Samsung emphasised its ‘Galaxy for the Planet’ initiative, a sustainability platform which establishes a set of targets to be reached by 2025 to reduce Samsung’s environmental footprint and lessen resource depletion from production to disposal of its Galaxy products. And in early September, HMD Global introduced ‘Circular’, a new sustainability subscription service that aims to give Nokia devices a second life through recycling, refurbishing and re-subscribing. Then, at its launch event last week, Apple went to great lengths to outline the eco-friendliness of its new devices.

Let’s take the iPhone 14 Pro as an example. Using Apple’s own words, the iPhone 14 Pro is “designed to minimise its impact on the environment, with 100% recycled rare earth elements used in all magnets, including those used in MagSafe, and 100% recycled tungsten in the Taptic Engine. The model also includes 100% recycled tin in the solder of multiple printed circuit boards, and 100% recycled gold in the plating of multiple printed circuit boards and in the wire of all cameras. Fiber-based packaging does not use outer plastic wrap, bringing Apple closer to its goal of completely removing plastic from all packaging by 2025”.

Sustainability highlights of the iPhone 14 Pro

All the focus on recycled materials has resulted in a drop in carbon emissions throughout the new devices’ life cycles compared to last years’ iterations. For example, the iPhone 14 has a carbon footprint of 61kg of CO2e, down from 64kg for the iPhone 13, and the iPhone 14 Pro has a carbon footprint of 65kg of CO2e compared to 69kg for the iPhone 13 Pro. This reduction in carbon footprint is mostly down to the increased use of recycled materials and a more efficient supply chain, meaning that the production proportion of the phone’s life cycle has dropped by as much as 10%.

One concerning point, however, was the increase in carbon emissions through the use of the new devices. This is especially true with the iPhone 14 Pro, where carbon emissions through use have increased by 18% compared to the iPhone 13 Pro (9.8kg CO2e versus 8.3kg CO2e). This could be down to the iPhone 14 Pro’s use of the new A16 Bionic chip, although Apple claim the A16 is 15-20% more efficient than the A15. Perhaps then it is due to the slightly upgraded Pro Motion display?

Carbon footprints for current and previous iPhones

Another interesting point is how much of the carbon footprint is accounted for by the manufacturing of the devices (around 80%). Yes, this is on the way down, but still accounts for the vast proportion of the phone’s life cycle. It is heartening, therefore, to see that iPhones are the most popular second-hand phones globally. Refurbished iPhones are a great way to ensure that the significant carbon emissions of producing a new iPhone go towards multiple lives of the device, not just one.

Refurbished smartphone sales, 2021

Apple also reiterated its carbon neutrality goals: by 2030, Apple plans to be 100% carbon neutral across its entire manufacturing supply chain and all product life cycles. This means that every Apple device sold, from component manufacturing, assembly, transport, customer use, charging, all the way through recycling and material recovery, will have net-zero climate impact. Setting ambitious goals such as this is vital in creating a sustainable future for the smartphone industry. With Apple’s resources and momentum, its target looks achievable.",Apple adds to growing industry sustainability drive

For the quarter, Apple posted revenue of $117.2 billion and net quarterly profit of $30.0 billion, or $1.88 per diluted share, compared to revenue of $123.9 billion and net quarterly profit of $34.6 billion, or $2.10 per diluted share, in the year-ago quarter.

Apple's revenue was down approximately 5% year-over-year, a steeper decline than had been expected by analysts as Apple grappled with iPhone supply issues in particular but which also saw declines in Mac and wearables.

Gross margin for the quarter was 43.0 percent, compared to 43.8 percent in the year-ago quarter. Apple also declared a quarterly dividend payment of $0.23 per share, payable on February 16 to shareholders of record as of February 13.

“As we all continue to navigate a challenging environment, we are proud to have our best lineup of products and services ever, and as always, we remain focused on the long term and are leading with our values in everything we do,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “During the December quarter, we achieved a major milestone and are excited to report that we now have more than 2 billion active devices as part of our growing installed base.”

As has been the case for over two years now, Apple is once again not issuing guidance for the current quarter ending in March.



Apple will provide live streaming of its fiscal Q1 2023 financial results conference call at 2:00 pm Pacific, and MacRumors will update this story with coverage of the conference call highlights.

Conference call recap ahead...



1:39 pm: After rising almost 4% in regular trading today, Apple's stock has given up almost all of those gains in after-hours trading following the earnings release, currently down around 3.5%.

1:42 pm: After four straight quarters of Services revenue in the $19 billion range, Apple finally broke through the $20 billion mark with an all-time record of $20.8 billion. iPad performance was also strong at nearly $9.4 billion in revenue, up from $7.2 billion in the year-ago quarter. But that wasn't enough to offset a decline in iPhone revenue from $71.6 billion to $65.8 billion. Mac revenue also saw a significant decline from $10.9 billion to $7.7 billion as Apple didn't release any updated Macs during the quarter.

2:01 pm: The call is beginning. Apple CEO Tim Cook and CFO Luca Maestri are on the call.

2:01 pm: Apple is reminding that the December quarter, as happens once every 6 years, has 14 weeks to align Apple's fiscal calendar year with the actual calendar year.

2:02 pm: ‌Tim Cook‌ is on for the prepared remarks.

The latest Mac mini and MacBook Pro models use 100% recycled aluminum in the enclosure, and recycled rare earth elements in all magnets. In HomePod, using 100% recycled gold in the printing of circuit boards.

2:15 pm: Cook is ""more confident about the future of Apple"" than he has ever been.

2:15 pm: CFO Luca Maestri is coming on to discuss the results in more detail.

2:16 pm: Revenue was down 5% year over year, including a very difficult foreign exchange environment that affected performance by almost 800bp. Grew revenue on constant currency basis across the vast majority of markets.

2:16 pm: Significant supply shortages for ‌iPhone 14 Pro‌ and Pro Max in November and through December. Offset by impact of 14th week of the quarter.

2:16 pm: Product revenue down by 8% due to factors mentioned. Install base of active devices grew double digits and set all time records in each category and geographic segment. More than 2 billion active devices.

2:17 pm: Extremely strong levels of customer satisfaction and loyalty and a high number of new users.

2:17 pm: Services set all-time revenue record, up 6% year over year. 700bp of negative FX. All-time records in Americas, Europe, and Asia Pac. Revenue records for Cloud, Payments, Music.

2:18 pm: OpEx of $14.3 billion were significantly below guidance, grew at slower pace than in the past, as the company took actions to respond to the negative macro environment. Strong operating cash flow of $34 billion.

2:20 pm: 96% customer sat on Macs according to 451 Research.

2:21 pm: ‌iPad‌ revenue up 30% year over year, driven by constraints in 2021 vs 2022 with ample supply, new ‌iPad Pro‌ powered by ‌M2‌ chip. ‌iPad‌ install base reached an all-time high. High number of new customers. Over half of new ‌iPad‌ customers were new to the product.

2:22 pm: Wearables/Home/Accessories was $13.5b, down 8% YoY. FX headwinds and challenging macro environment, but install base set a new all-time record, thanks to largest number of customers new to a smartwatch ever in the quarter.

2:23 pm: Record for Services and across most services offerings. FX and macro headwinds affected mobile gaming and digital advertising. Continue to observe several trends that reflect the strength of our ecosystem. Increased customer engagement with services, both transacting accounts and paid accounts grew double digits setting new alltime records. Paid subs grew nicely, with more than 935 million paid subs across services on platform, up 150 million during the last 12 months. Nearly 4x what we had 5 years ago.

2:23 pm: Reach and quality continue to improve, Apple Pay is available to millions of merchants in 70 countries and regions, record purchases during the holiday season. 2 billion active devices represents a great foundation for future expansion of the ecosystem. Continues to grow even during difficult macro conditions.

2:26 pm: Looking forward to March, Apple is not providing revenue guidance but sharing directional insights based on assumption that macro outlook and COVID impact does not worsen from current projects. March quarter YoY to be similar to December quarter. Acceleration in underlying business performance as December benefitted from an extra week. FX will be a headwind, and expect YoY impact of 5%. Services will grow YoY but face macro headwinds in digital ads and mobile gaming.

2:27 pm: Mac and ‌iPad‌ to decline double digits YoY because of challenging compares and macro headwinds. GM to be between 43.5 and 44.5%, OpEx between $13.7 and $13.9 billion, tax rate around 16%. Cash dividend of $0.23/share.

2:27 pm: The call is being opened to questions from analysts.

2:30 pm: Q: Talked about supply chain returning back to normal, we're still seeing disruptions across tech products in enterprise or consumer. What do you need to do to insulate your business from these episodic disruptions and how does that affect margin and balance sheet?

A: From supply point of view, saw disruption from early November through most of December, and from a supply chain point of view, we're now at a point where production is what we need it to be. The problem is behind us, but in terms of going forward and the supply chain, we build our products everywhere. There are component parts coming from many parts of the world and final assembly coming from 3 countries on just ‌iPhone‌. Continue to optimize it over time and change it to continue to improve, but I think when you zoom out and back up from it, the last three years have been a pretty difficult time between COVID and silicon shortages and the like. We've had a resilient supply chain in the aggregate.

In terms of supply for this quarter, I think we're in decent supply on most products for the quarter currently.

2:32 pm: Q: Dig into commentary on gross margins, especially guidance of 43.5-44.5 is quite strong. What's helping you out there? How should we think about currency and hedges looking forward?

A: We've had good margin for Dec quarter, 43%, December we have benefit of leverage thanks to seasonality, but favorable mix across the board. FX is an issue right now. In December, sequential 110bp negative, and YoY 300bp, so FX has changed a lot during the last 12 months. For March, we see margin expansion, 43.5-44.5, doing a lot of work around cost. Mix will continue to help, both within categories and Services as we move away from the holiday season, but doing a lot of work on the cost structure. FX is still a negative, about 50bp sequentially, but it's mitigating the last couple of weeks the dollar has weakened a bit, hopefully things will improve but for now we are in a good position on margins.

2:34 pm: Q: Can you talk about China? What you're seeing, issues with production but I mean on the demand side. Into Chinese new year and the reopening, are you seeing the Chinese consumer come back and what are they buying?

A: Declined by 7% last quarter, but grew on constant currency basis and despite significant supply constraints. Obviously the covid restrictions throughout China that happened in different places also impacted demand during the quarter. Look at the opening that started in December, we saw a marked change in traffic in our stores as compared in November and that followed to demand as well. I don't want to get into January, Jan is included in color that Luca provided earlier, but we did see a marked change from December compared to November.

2:35 pm: Q: That 2 billion device installed base figure, up 200m units YoY, suggests strongest growth in new devices as far back as you provide data points. Can you provide install base for ‌iPhone‌? Anything you see in new cohort of users that might look similar or different to past cohorts?

A: Install base is now over 2 billion active devices, and we set records across each geographic segment and product category, so broad-based change. To correct one thing, it's up 150m year over year. Last report we said was 1.85 billion. Up 150 which we're very proud of. Strong double-digit in several emerging markets, which is very important to us. India and Brazil as two examples. Very strong and obviously it bodes well for the future.

2:38 pm: Q: The Dec quarter was impacted by production challenges, can you unpack where channel levels are today across the ‌iPhone‌ broadly and what data is telling you about ‌iPhone‌ demand deferral vs destruction, and pushing upgrades into later of the year vs March.

A: Channel inventory on ‌iPhone‌, we obviously ended the December quarter below our target range given the supply challenges on ‌iPhone 14 Pro‌ and ‌iPhone 14 Pro‌ Max. Keep in mind, a year ago, we exited December below our target inventory range because of supply challenges in the year ago quarter, but not the same issue, just as a point. That hopefully gives you some flavor.

In January, we've included in our color, hard to estimate the recapture because you have to know what would have happened and how many people bought down and it takes a while to get those reports in during the quarter. We've made our best guess at it, in terms of sizing of the constraint in Q1, what we estimate (not with precision), we believe ‌iPhone‌ would have grown during the quarter had it not been for the supply shortages.

2:39 pm: Q: Talk more about guidance? What's that include re component pricing?

A: Capture every bit of cost structure and components are a part of that. Sequential negative on FX is 50bp, vs a year ago is 270bp, with the US dollar moving a lot over the last 12 months. Need to find offsets and more to negative FX in order to provide this kind of guidance and components are a big part of that.

2:40 pm: Q: How do you think about the role of AI particularly in services. Expand monetization in base, how do you implement it strategically?

A: It's incredible in terms of how it can enrich customer lives, and look no further than some of the things we announced in the fall with crash detection and fall detection, or back aways with ECG. These things have saved peoples lives. Enormous potential to affect everything we do. Horizontal technology not vertical, so it will affect every product and service that we have.

2:42 pm: Q: ‌iPhone‌ would have grown ex of production, tough to see what happens this time around, but historically with production issues, what has the consumer behavior been typically? DO they go to lower end model or do they defer, from a historical production?

A: It's very hard to estimate is the real answer, because you need a lot of data and it's only in hindsight that you have a more reasonable view of it. We put our best views in the color that Luca provided. That's kind of what I would say.

2:44 pm: Q: Think about services going forward, really good growth over the last several years. What do you think drives the growth of expansion of install base vs ARPU going forward?

A: A number of things, the first step is always the install base. It's the engine for services growth. Growing nicely in emerging markets and growing faster, gives us a larger addressable pool of customers. Seeing that the level of engagement for customers already in our ecosystem continues to grow. Both transacting accounts and paid accounts grew double digits, so that bodes very well for the future. A lot of transacting accounts that move to paid accounts over time. Other aspect is to continue to improve the reach and quality of our services. Gave example of ‌Apple Pay‌, it's a great example, started in the US, taken to 70 markets, millions of merchants, payment services set new highs for us. As you've seen for us over hte last few years, we launch new services over time. We're very excited and when we look at the behavior of our install base we think it's promising for our services business.

2:46 pm: Q: Question on emerging markets, lot of strides in India. Wanted to understand share in China and India, and what would be aspirational but achievable share in those territories?

A: Set quarterly revenue record in India and grew strong double digits year over year. Feel very good about how we performed and that's despite headwinds. India is a hugely exciting market for us and is a major focus. We brought the online store there in 2020, we will soon bring Apple Retail there, and putting a lot of emphasis on the market. A lot done from financing and trade-ins to make products more affordable and give people more options to buy. A lot going on there, we're in essence taking what we learned in China years ago and how we scaled China and bringing that to bear and I don't have the exact market shares in front of me, but you would see that from a share point of view, we grew around the world last quarter on ‌iPhone‌ despite challenges on the supply side. I wouldn't expect to have a difference in those two markets.

2:47 pm: Q: Theoretical question on pricing. Manufacturing in the US and other territories that might be more expensive than where you're building now, have you studied the elasticity of demand relative to small price increases in products?

A: We have experience in that, but I wouldn't necessarily draw the same conclusion in terms of the cost of the product. We don't know what the impact will be at this point, we're all in in terms of being the largest customer for TSMC in Arizona and we're very proud to take part in that. That's what I would say about that.

2:50 pm: Q: How do we compare this cycle for iPhones for Pro vs non-Pro over last several years? Is move to higher ASP sustainable or does it reverse in tighter spending environment?

A: 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max have done extremely well up to the point where we had a supply shortage and couldn't provide the total of the demand. It's definitely a strong Pro cycle. I think there are a number of reasons, but the important one is the product. The innovation is the product and they speak for themselves and we feel very good about the product we announced in September and are happy that we're at a point where we're shipping to the demand.

Q: Is the move to higher ASP, is that sustainable in this tough macro environment?

A: I wouldn't want to predict, but I would say that the smartphone, for us the ‌iPhone‌, has become so integral into people's lives, it contains their contacts and health information and banking information and smart home and so many different parts of their lives. Payment vehicle for many people. I think people are willing to really stretch to get the best they can afford in that category.

2:51 pm: Q: Emphasizing the focus and importance of the install base, think about growth of install base from 1 to 2 billion, how should we think about the penetration of services and paying customers on services over that time frame? How fast is that growing vs the install base?

A: We keep track of that, very important for us. Over the last 7 years as we've doubled the install base, we've seen a growing engagement of our customers on that platform. That happens by customers transacting on the platform and then moving to paid accounts, starting to pay for some of the services. That percentage of paid accounts tends to grow over time. We see it in developed and emerging markets. We made it easier for our customers to get engaged on the platform, we have multiple payment methods in many countries and we've made it easier to explore for more services, we've add a lot of services on the platform over the last 7 years. Higher engagemenet means higher percentage of paid accounts, over time.

2:54 pm: Q: You mentioned earlier on the call about India. Are we now entering a situation of more opportunity exiting COVID, India building out higher-speed transmissions and you're underrepresented there. Diversifying operational risk not specific to a country, opening up stores, is it more primed for opportunity now than ever?

A: We actually did fairly well through covid in India and I'm more bullish now that we're hopefully on the other side of it. That's why we're investing there with retail and the online store. Putting a significant amount of energy there, I'm very bullish on India.

2:55 pm: Q: Services overall were better than expected. What surprised you to the upside on services?

A: Primarily the level of engagement that we saw, which reflects into the paid subscriptions. Saw very good results in cloud services, payment services, Music was very strong. We had a number of categories that set new all time records, and did a bit better than we were expecting at the beginning of the quarter. Tim mentioned it during his prepared remarks, when you look at it in constant currency we grew Services double digits and that was on top of 24% increase a year ago. Sustained growth that we're seeing.

2:56 pm: Q: Mentioned how the macro had an impact, when you look across hardware products and services, where do you see biggest and smallest impact from softening macro?

A: Some impact across products and services, probably the ones that we saw the most impact on were Mac and Wearables, you can see that in those numbers. Probably least was ‌iPhone‌.

2:57 pm: Q: PC industry is expecting a decline in shipments, how does Mac as a whole match that and is there any color?

A: The industry is challenged as you say. Industry is contracting, I don't want to predict the year. We have a reasonable sized, big market. We have a low share and we have a competitive advantage with Apple Silicon, so strategically we are well positioned within the market albeit I think it will be a little rough in the short term.

New Zealand-based company VentureFruit has unveiled Tutti, the world’s first branded apple variety bred specifically for production in hot climates.

Twenty years in the making, Tutti’s commercial launch at Fruit Logistica in Berlin follows five years of extensive research and production trials under the variety name HOT84A1.

Morgan Rogers, VentureFruit’s general manager, described Tutti as a stand-out apple which meets both grower and consumer needs.

“With the world’s climate changing, it’s vital innovative new varieties are developed to withstand high temperatures and enable growers across all major continents to adapt and have sustainable businesses, while providing consumers with great tasting apples,” he commented, “and that’s what Tutti delivers.”

In Spain, for example, challenging growing conditions and extreme daytime temperatures of over 40 degrees, combined with warmer nights, make it difficult to grow apples.

“Tutti solves this challenge,” said Morgan. “It has been specifically bred to grow in hot conditions and produce a deliciously light crisp apple, with bright red skin and a rounded sweet fresh flavour. Tutti also grows successfully in different growing conditions, having been tested throughout Europe, including Italy, France, Germany, Switzerland and the UK.”

He added: “With today’s commercial launch of the variety, we now invite interested parties from across Europe to submit their interest in being a Tutti licence holder and growing this innovative new apple variety.”

Product pipeline

Tutti is the first apple brand to be released commercially by the Hot Climate Partnership (HCP), a collaboration between Spanish institute IRTA, New Zealand’s Plant & Food Research, Catalonian producer association Fruit Futur, and VentureFruit, a genetics and variety management business created by NZ multinational T&G Global.

HCP was founded in 2002 in response to challenges experienced by Spanish growers. Its specific aim is to develop new varieties of apples and pears and release them commercially. Initiated in 2002.

At present, it has an extensive pipeline of apple and pear varieties, 13 of which are now in their final years of evaluation and testing.

This includes consumer sensory research conducted across key markets to help shape the commercial proposition of each new variety.

Following the release of Tutti, VentureFruit expects to commercialise an additional five new apple and pear varieties over the next seven years, all of which have been specifically bred to be tolerant of hot climates.

A climate of collaboration

T&G Global’s chief executive Gareth Edgecombe said the strength of the unique HCP was its combined scientific, growing and commercialisation expertise.

“Addressing the potential impact of climate change on the world’s apple and pear sector is not something one business can do, it takes collaboration, knowledge sharing, commitment and a vision for what is possible,” he said.

“Through the dedication of our partnership and testing partners, the Hot Climate Partnership addresses both climate change mitigation and adaptation. Innovative varieties like Tutti can grow in warm and rising temperatures, while at the same time potentially help open up new growing regions which previously may have been unsuitable for growing apples and pears given their climatic conditions.

“It’s innovative solutions like Tutti that our sector needs to meet the evolving needs of our global consumers and customers, and ensure we continue to build a sustainable and resilient sector.”

Brand benefits

The brand name Tutti was chosen to underline the variety’s potential benefit to growers, who want more sustainable production, and to consumers, who want a great-tasting apple.

Kate James, business development manager at VentureFruit, said the name was also chosen to reflect the fun, fresh feeling of the eating experience, as well as the programme’s core concept.

“Tutti’s translation means ‘everyone’ or ‘all together’ in Italian, a concept at the very heart of the Hot Climate Partnership, which is delivering better solutions for growers, consumers and retailers,” she said.

“Its brand tagline ‘love every bite’ promises to meet the test of a great apple – how it tastes. With commercial plantings already underway, we can’t wait to see Tutti apples on retailers shelves.*

Tutti will be sold and marketed through a peer-to-peer network that allows participating third-party licence-holders to grow, market and sell the variety within their licensed territory according to agreed brand specifications.

The new variety is open for licensing to all growers, fresh produce sales and marketing companies, and plant nurseries.","VentureFruit unveils Tutti, world’s first ever hot-climate apple"

April 5(Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) on Wednesday said that more of its supply chain is committing to use renewable energy in producing the company's iPhones, Macs and other products.

Apple said suppliers are supporting 13 gigawatts of active renewable energy projects, up from 10 gigawatts last year. Apple suppliers have made commitments to support an eventual total of 20 gigawatts of projects, up from a total of 16 gigawatts a year before, the company said.

Apple says its own operations have been carbon-neutral since 2020, but the company has been working to extend that promise to its entire global supply chain by 2030. Some of Apple's biggest suppliers such as Foxconn have been part of its clean energy program since 2019.

Apple on Wednesday said that 250 of its suppliers have pledged to use renewable energy for Apple production, up from 213 suppliers the year before. The 250 suppliers represent about 85% of Apple's direct manufacturing spending, the company said.

In China, 70 suppliers have made clean energy pledges for Apple production, up from 55 last year, the company said.

Apple has announced a major acceleration of its work to expand recycled materials across its products — including new 2025 targets to use 100 percent recycled cobalt in all Apple-designed batteries; all magnets in Apple devices will be composed of entirely recycled rare earth elements; and all Apple-designed printed circuit boards will use 100 percent recycled tin soldering and 100 percent recycled gold plating.

In 2022, the company significantly expanded its use of key recycled metals and now sources over two-thirds of all aluminum nearly three-quarters of all rare earth metals, and more than 95 percent of all tungsten in Apple products from 100 percent recycled material.

“Our ambition to one day use 100 percent recycled and renewable materials in our products works hand in hand with our goal to achieve carbon-neutral products by 2030,” said Lisa Jackson, Apple’s VP of Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives. “We’re working toward both goals with urgency and advancing innovation across our entire industry in the process.”

Charting progress to 2025

Cobalt is a critical material in most consumer electronics batteries, but the mining of it is rife with human rights abuses including child labor. Apple-designed batteries found in iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, MacBook and many other products represent a significant majority of the Apple’s cobalt use; the company’s significant expansion of its use of 100 percent certified recycled cobalt over the past three years all but eliminates its need for unearthing new cobalt and makes it possible to include in all Apple-designed batteries by 2025. In 2022, a quarter of all cobalt found in Apple products came from recycled material, up from 13 percent the previous year.

Apple’s use of 100 percent certified recycled rare earth elements has also expanded in the last year — going from 45 percent in 2021 to 73 percent in 2022. Since first introducing recycled rare earths in the Taptic Engine of the iPhone 11, Apple has expanded its use of the materials across its devices — including in all magnets found in the latest iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, MacBook and Mac models. As magnets are by far Apple’s largest use of rare earths, the new 2025 target means nearly all rare earths in Apple products will soon be 100 percent recycled.

As part of the accelerated new timeline, all Apple-designed printed circuit boards will use 100 percent certified recycled gold plating by 2025. This includes rigid boards, such as the main logic board; and flexible boards, such as those connecting to the cameras or buttons in iPhone. Since pioneering an exclusively recycled supply chain for gold in the plating of the main logic board for iPhone 13, Apple has extended the material’s use in additional components and products — including the wire of all cameras in the iPhone 14 lineup; and printed circuit boards of iPad, Apple Watch, AirPods Pro, MacBook Pro, Mac mini and HomePod. Apple is also working to encourage broader adoption of recycled gold for non-custom components across the electronics industry.

By 2025, the company will use 100 percent certified recycled tin soldering on all Apple-designed printed rigid and flexible circuit boards. In recent years, Apple’s use of recycled tin has expanded to the solder of many flexible printed circuit boards across Apple products, with 38 percent of all tin used last year coming from recycled sources. The application of recycled tin across even more components is underway, and the company is engaging more suppliers in this effort.

Progress in responsible sourcing of primary and recycled materials

As Apple reduces its reliance on newly mined minerals, it is also pursuing ways to directly support communities whose livelihoods depend on mining. The company is partnering with experts such as the Fund for Global Human Rights to provide support for frontline human rights and environmental defenders, including in the African Great Lakes region; as well as vocational education programs that enable members of local communities moving away from mining to build skills and pursue new opportunities.

Apple continues to broaden its efforts to sources primary minerals responsibly. In the transition to recycled and renewable content, it has prioritized 14 materials based on environmental, human rights and supply impacts that together account for nearly 90 percent of the material shipped in Apple products: aluminum, cobalt, copper, glass, gold, lithium, paper, plastics, rare earth elements, steel, tantalum, tin, tungsten and zinc.

Apple was the first electronics company to publish a list of cobalt and lithium refiners in its battery supply chain, with cobalt in 2016 and lithium in 2020. In 2017, the company mapped its supply chain for rare earths. And since 2015, every identified smelter and refiner for the four main conflict minerals — tin, tungsten, tantalum and gold — has participated in independent, third-party audits.

In 2022, about 20 percent of all material shipped in Apple products came from recycled or renewable sources. This includes the first use of recycled copper foil in the main logic board of iPad (10th generation), the introduction of certified recycled steel in the battery tray of MacBook Air with the M2 chip, 100 percent recycled tungsten in the latest Apple Watch lineup; and the aluminum enclosures found in many Apple products, made with a 100 percent recycled aluminum alloy designed by Apple.

From minerals to plastic

Apple has also announced progress on its 2025 commitment to eliminate plastics from its packaging through the development of fiber alternatives for components such as screen films, wraps and foam cushioning. To address the remaining 4 percent plastic in its packaging footprint, Apple is working to replace labels, lamination and other small uses. In the last year, Apple developed a custom printer to introduce digital printing directly onto the boxes of iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro, eliminating the need for most labels. And a new overprint varnish found in iPad Air, iPad Pro and Apple Watch Series 8 packaging replaces the polypropylene plastic lamination found on boxes and packaging components — the company says this innovation has helped avoid over 1,100 metric tons of plastic and over 2,400 metric tons of carbon dioxide.

Advancing electronics recycling

Apple’s continues to work to pioneer advancements in end-of-life disassembly and recycling. Through extensive efforts including partnerships with leading research institutions and the Material Recovery Lab in Austin, Texas, Apple is developing ways to give materials in its products new life, and helping inform design decisions that support disassembly and recovery.

The company’s iPhone disassembly robot, Daisy, separates batteries from other components; and enables specialty recyclers to recover cobalt, lithium and rare earth elements — which are largely lost through traditional electronics-recycling processes. Apple estimates that more than 11,000 kilograms of cobalt have been recovered from batteries extracted by Daisy and then returned to the secondary market since 2019.

Daisy is just one example of how Apple’s innovations in recycling and disassembly can drive industrywide change. The company’s Dave robot, now deployed with a recycling partner in China, helps further recovery of rare earth elements by disassembling Taptic Engines.

Apple has also begun deploying overhead projector-based augmented reality (AR) systems to recycling partners, which guides the disassembly of devices including MacBook and iPad by projecting video imagery directly onto a work surface. The company publishes Apple Recycler Guides for global recyclers to maximize efficiency of material recovery while safeguarding human health and safety. As recycled and renewable materials can contribute to lowering each product’s carbon footprint, enhanced recovery is also bringing Apple closer to its goal to be carbon neutral across its entire supply chain and the life cycle of every product by 2030.","Apple Products to Include 100% Recycled Cobalt, Rare Earth Metals by 2025"

The MacBook Air is always considered an entry-level due to its lower specs and smaller screen size. Usually, if you need a MacBook with a better performance, then you will be forced to purchase the more expensive pro model. Apple limited some high-end processors to the Pro models in the days of using intel. After switching to Apple’s own M-series of silicon chips, the MacBook Air got an upgraded performance to the level of the Pro models.

Now, you can get a powerful MacBook Air for the price of an entry-level laptop and enjoy a full pro-level performance. However, there is one important feature that all MacBook Air laptops lack till date. All MacBook Air laptops always come with smaller screen sizes. Due to this, you would have to buy a pro model if you wanted a larger display. Better still, you could get a Windows laptop if you don’t want to spend a lot of money for a MacBook Pro.

Apple is Planning to Launch a 15-inch MacBook Air

Finally, Apple has considered producing MacBook Air laptops with larger display. So, if you plan to purchase a MacBook Pro just because of the larger display, you can forget about it now. Apple will release a new MacBook Air with 15-inch display this year. However, sources have claimed that the specs of this laptop will not be too encouraging.

Gizchina News of the week Join GizChina on Telegram

The previous edition of the MacBook Air came with Apple’s M2 chip. For the 2023 edition, we all expected some great upgrades over its predecessor. However, Apple has a whole different plan. Sources close to the story have suggested that the 15-inch MacBook Air will still feature the same chip that came with the previous edition.

Also, the new MacBook Air will feature a display resolution similar to the of the current MacBook Pro. The 8GB of RAM which is tipped to come with this new Air will also be another factor to consider.

A few years back, Apple was known for releasing all of its latest products with the latest in hardware and features. However, the Cupertino company made some changes to this. Allowing only the pro models to feature the latest while vanilla models stick to specs of the previous pro models.

A notable example is what Apple started with the iPhone 14 series. The standard iPhone 14 maintained the Bionic A15 chip which was used in the iPhone 13 series. The latest A16 chip was exclusive to the Pro models only. In that case, it may not come as much of a surprise that the upcoming MacBook Air will stick to the M2 chip of the current generation. Apple making the latest M3 chips exclusive to the Pro models of this year fits very well into its new way of doing things.

Is The MacBook Air 15 2023 Worth Buying?

The upcoming MacBook Air with 15-inch display is worth every penny. As matter of fact, it is advisable to purchase it instead of spending the extra cash in buying the next pro model. The M2 chip is still very far from expiring and it packs enough power to handle all your tasks easily. Besides, you also get a larger display this time in addition to the lower price tag.

Upper Burdekin was set to begin operations in 2026 with construction to start this year.

The amount of power Apple was intending to buy was the energy equivalent of powering 80,000 homes.

An Apple spokesperson confirmed the IT giant had pulled out of the wind farm deal.

""Apple is no longer participating in the Upper Burdekin project.""

""Apple will continue to explore renewable energy projects in Australia,” the spokesperson said.

No reason was given as to why Apple had changed its mind although the Australian Financial Review suggested environmental reasons were behind the decision.

Windlab has been contacted for comment on the matter.

The company is majority owned by billionaire mining magnate Andrew ""Twiggy"" Forrest, who founded the Fortesque Metals Group.

All in all, Upper Burdekin Wind Farm was set to generate up to 500 megawatt from 80 turbines, down from 136 originally.

Once operational, the wind farm was set to have enough generation capacity to provide renewable energy for up to 300,000 homes, sufficient to power every household in Townsville three times over, Windlab said.

However, the project ran into resistance this year, The Guardian reported, after Windlab published an environmental report that said 769 hectares needed to be cleared, which ran the risk of endangering several already threatened species.

Update April 5: A Windlab spokesperson told CRN Australia that the deal with Apple is off.

“Windlab and Apple have agreed to terminate a power purchase agreement (PPA) for the Upper Burdekin Wind Farm,"" the spokesperson said.

“The development phase of the project has taken significantly longer than originally anticipated, and the project no longer meets the PPA’s milestone requirements,” the spokesperson said.

Windlab also denied the project was threatening already endangered species.

“Any suggestion that we will not apply the highest of standards to protect koalas and other species is incorrect,"" the spokesperson said.

“Following more than two years’ in-depth environmental studies and consultation, we have delivered a project design that preserves more than 98 percent of native vegetation on the cattle property where the project is located.""

“We will deliver robust management plans to ensure the welfare of native species.""

“This includes the project being a Tier 1 monitoring site for the CSIRO’s National Koala Monitoring Program, appointment of expert ecologists to supervise project activity, implementing appropriate exclusion zones, relocating wildlife if required, creating buffer zones around identified habitat and reducing weeds and predatory pests,” the spokesperson concluded.",Apple pulls out of Upper Burdekin wind farm project

The goal is to ensure backup suppliers for every component, as well as to reduce dependence on China …

Apple tiger teams

The term “tiger teams” was first coined way back in 1964 to describe cross-disciplinary teams brought together to take an aggressive and rapid approach to problem-solving – where no potential solution is off the table, and no respect need be shown to past ways of doing things.

The most famous example was the Apollo 13 troubleshooting team, originally named the White Team, and later renamed the Tiger Team. They were awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom for saving the astronauts aboard the module.

It’s common for these teams to report directly to very senior execs, and in Apple’s case, Bloomberg reports that CEO Tim Cook has direct involvement.

Reducing dependence on China

We’ve been warning for many years about both the need and the difficulty of reducing Apple’s dependence on China, but the pandemic made even clearer the risks of the company having most of its manufacturing eggs in one basket. COVID-19-related disruption at the world’s biggest iPhone assembly plant was estimated to have cost the company a billion dollars per week.

During Cook’s recent visit to China, he praised the “symbiotic relationship” the company enjoys with the country – while his tiger teams were hard at work to reduce the extent of it.

Even as Cook was smoothing things over in Beijing, Apple executives were hard at work developing ties to other countries to lessen reliance on the country, according to multiple people familiar with Apple’s operations […] Apple’s efforts center on India as a location for production of iPhones and accessories, Vietnam for AirPods and Mac assembly, Malaysia for some Mac production, and Ireland—where suppliers currently build the relatively easy-to-produce iMacs—for a range of simpler products. Managers in Apple’s operations department have instructed employees to focus on sourcing additional components and locating production lines outside China for more new products coming in 2024.

Backup suppliers

Apple has always liked to have multiple suppliers for as many components as possible. This lessens the risks of relying on a single company, and also enables the iPhone maker to play multiple suppliers against each other in order to negotiate the best possible terms.

But the pandemic made backup suppliers even more important, and today’s report says that the company is now taking this to new levels of detail, within China as well as outside it.

It has expanded the efforts of these teams, which set up shop in suppliers’ factories in China and other countries, assess facility maintenance schedules, and assemble more extensive lists of backup suppliers for every component, right down to screws and plastic inserts. The company is working to improve its forecasts, component by component, to better anticipate potential shortages.

Fear of Chinese retaliation

While the tiger teams are geared to rapid change, there are hurdles to be overcome – including retaliation by the Chinese government, or push-back from Chinese consumers.

Apple’s leadership is concerned that China might retaliate if it moves too much capacity to other countries, or transitions too rapidly. Customers in China could turn against US-designed products amid heightened nationalism. The company also has concerns about its ability to ensure high standards of quality in Vietnam and particularly Malaysia, given the current state of the manufacturing industries in those countries.

The piece also notes that there may be conflicts between the product development teams – which want to take full advantage of new tech, even if there is only one supplier, based in China – while the procurement team will be arguing against such dependence.

The full piece is worth reading.

The first batch yielded 30,000 litres of vinegar and has helped to prevent 50 tonnes of apples from being wasted.

The Continente Seleção Apple of Alcobaça Cider Vinegar, produced from fresh apple juice, has also obtained IGP certification, the retailer noted.

Select apple varieties – including Casa Nova, Golden Delicious, Red Delicious, Royal Gala, Fuji, Granny Smith, Jonagold, Reineta and Pink – have been used in making the vinegar.

Continente challenged five apple producers from Alcobaça – a Portuguese city and municipality 100 kilometres north of Lisbon – to develop a product using small or deformed apples that are not commercially viable.

Ondina Afonso, president of the Continente Producers’ Club, added, “The project began through an initiative of the Continente Producers’ Club, the ‘Waste Fair’, aimed at producers, promoting the valuation of some products, such as those that the end customer does not value, nor wants to buy, such as fruit that is too small or with defects.”

The Project

Apple producers Narc Frutas, Cooperfrutas, Frutalvor, Campotec and Lusofruta collaborated with Continente’s industrial partner, Mendes Gonçalves, to create the product.

Jorge Soares, administrator of Campotec, added, “We already have a very old partnership with MC [Mendes Gonçalves], of supplying apples from Alcobaça, and this project arises from the communion of the work of several producers as a way of solving the problem of apples that would result in food waste.

“The Alcobaça Apple Vinegar is a way for us to help the planet by transforming these apples into a value-added product.”

“In our study, we were able to see how an apple – specifically, the Empire apple developed at Cornell in the 1940s – improved the intestinal health of production broilers, and we observed signs for the overall good health of the bird,” Jackson said.

The researchers injected juice, pomace and pulp – in vivo – into the amniotic fluid of the developing embryo inside a chicken egg. After the eggs were hatched, relevant samples were collected for analyses.

The researchers found that introducing apple juice and pomace into the egg can increase the young chicken’s transport system for amino acids, improve the bioavailability of iron, boost the microbial populations in the animal’s large intestine and support the growth of potentially beneficial gut bacteria.

“Apples are comprised of bioactive constituents such as phytochemicals and prebiotics that could help intestinal health and the gut microbiome,” said senior author Elad Tako, associate professor of food science in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences (CALS) and a co-author of the paper.

Each year, the U.S. sees nearly $20 billion in apple sales, with an estimated 5 million tons of the fruit produced annually in the U.S. within the last decade, according to the paper.

For juice and apple production, about 33.4 million bushels of apples were used in 2021-22, according to the U.S. Apple Association. Nearly 175,350 metric tons of apple pomace – the fibrous waste – is produced annually and typically tossed away in landfills, according to the paper. This damages the environment, as it disrupts the carbon-nitrogen ratio of soil due to the pomace’s sugar content.

“Pomace is treated like industrial waste now. If we can potentially use the pomace, which is rich in nutrients, we can add it to the diet of broilers,” Tako said. “We can improve the nutrition in their feed and achieve productivity in a more natural way – and potentially reduce the use of added dietary chemicals.”

The researchers said this was an initial study to demonstrate the potential effect for adding apple waste to chicken feed and they indicated a need for long-term studies.

Said Tako: “Potentially, we’ll be upscaling industrial waste that is currently being discarded. That’s sustainable.”

In addition to Jackson and Tako, the co-authors of “Empire Apple (Malus domestica) Juice, Pomace, and Pulp Modulate Intestinal Functionality, Morphology, and Bacterial Populations In Vivo (Gallus gallus)” are Cornell doctoral students Viral Shukla, Nikolai Kolba and Nikita Agarwal; and Olga I. Padilla-Zakour, professor of food science.

While it did not specify the volume to be procured from the project, Apple said that the contracted power is equal to the electricity consumption of 80,000 homes per year. For comparison, Windlab estimates that its 100-turbine project can produce electricity for up to 300,000 Australian homes.

Apple is already carbon neutral across its global operations and aims to achieve the same across its entire business and manufacturing supply chain and products by 2030.

Windlab, owned by Squadron Energy and Federation Asset Management, intends to build the Upper Burdekin wind park on pastoral land in Queensland’s Badhun county. Last month, the developer sealed an indigenous land use agreement with the traditional owners of the selected site.

Upper Burdekin is the second project contracted by Apple to address the electricity customers use to charge their Apple devices and follows a deal for a 300-MW solar project in Texas.

Its decision to pivot to services and subscriptions means that around 40% of its gross revenues after costs in the last quarter were generated by those two buckets of revenue. But that’s not the only smart decision the company has made of late; the decision to migrate its entire business to renewable energy is equally far sighted.

Here's why that matters.

Services = Servers + electricity

Apple’s services live in the cloud. And because they're cloud based, they use energy — lots of it. Now, I’ve glanced though the company’s environmental reports and I’m not 100% clear just how much energy those services use. But it’s not inconsequential.

At the same time, the company has been using 100% renewable electricity at offices, retail stores, and data centers since 2018, and now it is attempting to switch suppliers to renewables.

That’s not just greenwashing, you know. It’s an essential step that every business needs to take, as the cold hard truths (particularly in context of war in Ukraine) is that energy:

Costs money.

Production is limited.

Can hold back the development of entire regions (because of the proliferation of cloud services).

What’s happening now

In West London, the proliferation of data centers means developers cannot build new properties because the grid is operating at full capacity. In the Wstelijk Havengebied region of Amsterdam, no new businesses can be put in place because of the energy demands of a 100MW data center being built there.

That’s not just a problem for property developers, new businesses, and data centers — it’s also a problem that will put limits on the evolution of electronic vehicles. After all, to replace every car with battery-powered equivalents we’d need to deploy thousands of GW of new electricity production, not to mention making big improvements to electricity supply grids to carry all that load. (And we’ve looked at the scarcity of charge points before.)

This challenge is intensifying.

The move to remote, hybrid work means enterprise users are expanding their reliance on various forms of hosted and on-prem cloud services. Those SaaS services need electricity to run. That’s driving a rapid proliferation of data centers worldwide, and while Apple attempts to run its enterprise on renewable energy, not every operator does — and even renewable energy is questionable once you make use of Carbon Offset Credits.

Even if you pay to plant trees somewhere, you’re still pulling electricity off the grid (though it is helpful that many of Apple’s data centers are based close to Apple-supported renewable energy sources).

Where does your business get its energy?

What does this mean? To me, it means that Apple should be applauded for seeing this problem coming and beginning to take steps to meet it early on.

That’s great, but the inconvenient fact is that not every company has taken similar action, which means that for every solar or wind-powered Apple data center you’ll probably find several more that rely on old-fashioned electricity supply.

It shows that a laissez-faire approach to energy production and consumption, particularly in the context of limited supplies and the fast proliferation of data-driven services essential to enterprise (and thus the economic health of the nation), needs to be organized at a national and trans-national level.

This was always going to happen in the computer world. We always knew computers used electricity, and while manufacturers continue (well, Apple continues) to explore ways to render more performance per watt than, it shouldn’t be a surprise to consider that at some point we’d hit an energy supply wall. And that seems to be what is slowly happening.

[Also read: Why you should pay more attention to Apple’s green slide]

What happens next?

Controversially, we need to look to China for some sense of this. Faced with huge demand for energy and big problems around industrial pollution, that nation has been on course to deploy alternative energy sources for years. It has achieved a great deal, pollution is down, and it continues to make more use of wind, solar, hydro, and other energy production technologies.

That’s something we must see in other nations, as the costs and consequences of fossil fuel-based energy dependency are being rapidly demonstrated in Europe and worldwide. It may seem like a simplistic analysis, but the next wave of innovation must surely be in the creation of dependable, renewable energy. Because, unless that challenge is convincingly resolved, the eternal rollout of technology is going to hit a wall.

Once again, Apple’s astute management saw this coming. Now other enterprises need to raise their game. Because digital transformation is nothing without energy supply.

An article describing the research is published in the journal Biomass Conversion and Biorefinery. The key concept is that of the circular economy, a system of closed loops designed to reduce costs, recover resources from waste, promote reuse and recycling, and maximize use of bioenergy and biomaterials.

Apples are among the most widely consumed fruits worldwide, both fresh and processed as juice, vinegar and cider, among other products. The apple processing industry throws away much of the fruit as waste.

According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), global apple production totaled almost 86.5 metric tons in 2020. The main producers were China (46.85%), the United States (5.38%) and Turkey (4.97%).

“Biorefining with dry anaerobic digestion produces electricity and thermal energy, reduces greenhouse gas emissions, and valorizes waste via conversion to organic fertilizer,” said Tânia Forster Carneiro, last author of the article. Carneiro earned a PhD in industrial process engineering from the University of Cadiz in Spain in 2004 and is currently a lecturer in bioengineering and biotechnology at UNICAMP’s School of Food Engineering (FEA).

Anaerobic digestion, she explained, is a microbiological process involving consumption of nutrients and production of methane. Dry anaerobic digestion, with total solids in the reactor exceeding 15%, is considered an efficient method of recycling solid organic waste and far more environmentally appropriate than landfill disposal.

The results pointed to a yield of 36.61 liters of methane per kilogram (kg) of removed solids, potentially generating 1.92 kilowatt hours (kWh) of electricity and 8.63 megajoules (MJ) of heat per ton of apple pomace.

The bioenergy thus recovered could supply 19.18% of the electricity and 11.15% of the heat used to operate the anaerobic biorefining reactor designed by the researchers, who conclude that biofuels and bioelectricity can contribute to public policy, reduce fossil fuel consumption and cut the greenhouse gas emissions from organic residues.

Energy transition

The research group found the greenhouse gas emissions avoided by the biogas corresponded to 0.14 kg of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO 2 e) in the electricity and 0.48 kg of CO 2 e in the heat generated per ton of apple pomace.

“Anaerobic digestion is a stable technology and can be implemented in small to medium plants, assisting the circular economy transition and offering an added-value alternative to disposal of fruit residues as waste that benefits the entire supply chain,” Carneiro said.

The other authors of the article are Larissa Castro Ampese, William Gustavo Sganzerla and Henrique Di Domenico Ziero, PhD candidates at FEA-UNICAMP; Josiel Martins Costa, currently a postdoctoral fellow at FEA-UNICAMP; and Gilberto Martins, a professor at UFABC’s School of Engineering, Modeling and Applied Social Sciences.

The research is supported by FAPESP via three projects (18/14938-4, 19/26925-7 and 21/03950-6).

Carneiro and Sganzerla recently published an article on anaerobic digestion to produce methane from malting barley bagasse in the beer industry, detailing the gains in electricity and heat in terms of the balance of mass and energy in all inbound and outbound flows. The article shows that it is possible to produce 0.23 megawatt-hours of electricity for every metric ton of barley bagasse processed (read more at: agencia.fapesp.br/39093).

However, a new leak from inside Apple has revealed that while the new iPhone will use USB-C, it will require a specialised MFi cable for proper operation, raising questions about Apple's compatibility and charging standards. Why has Apple hated the inclusion of USB-C as a standard, what has the new leak suggested, and could Apple get away with such a plan?

Why has Apple hated the inclusion of USB-C as a standard?

When it comes to USB cables, it is almost universally agreed that USB-C is by far one of the best. To start, USB-C entirely eliminates the USB superposition phenomenon whereby it takes three attempts to insert a USB connector (thanks to its ability to be inserted in any orientation). Secondly, USB-C connectors have multiple channels and can support USB 3.0 speeds (expected to exceed 40Gbps), and thirdly, USB-C connectors can support much higher charging currents. But above all else, it seems that USB-C will likely become the universal connector for all devices, and this will massively help reduce e-waste while only requiring users to have one cable type for data and charging.

As the rest of the industry rapidly moves towards USB-C, Apple has been notably resistant to its use. Sure, the latest iPad utilises a USB-C connector, and several of their MacBooks use USB-C as well, but Apple still produces consumer devices with their own proprietary connectors. But recently, the EU introduced new legislation requiring all consumer charging devices to use USB-C, and Apple was not happy with this decision.

According to Apple, forcing manufacturers to use USB-C stifles innovation, takes away design freedom, and hurts the overall capabilities of engineers. Now, while this argument may seem reasonable (as governments telling engineers how to do their job never ends well), it is more likely that Apple doesn’t want to use USB-C so it can retain control over its proprietary technologies, squeezing out money from anyone who wants to create compatible products.

It should be noted that the solutions that Apple have produced are exceptionally good; the lightning cable is also double-sided and can be inserted in any orientation like USB-C. However, as only Apple devices use the lightning port, it is very difficult for customers to use generic off-the-shelf cables with them. This is notably seen in cheap charging cables that often cannot provide quick charging or data capabilities. Thus, users are often forced to buy Apple cables that conform to their Made For iPad/iPhone (MFi) certification, which are extraordinarily expensive.









A new leak suggests Apple will circumvent USB-C requirements

Recently, a well-known leaker called ShrimpApplePro has released internal Apple information regarding the next generation of USB-C devices and how Apple will bend the rules to force users to purchase expensive cables. Despite the EU specifically stating that new USB-C devices need to support fast charging regardless of the cable used, Apple may only provide the bare minimum capabilities over standard USB-C cables while providing full capabilities when using Apple MFi-certified cables.

Whether the source of this information can be trusted is up for debate. However, the aforementioned user was correct with their leak on the Dynamic Island and the iPhone 14 RAM increase. Considering Apple’s history with custom cables, pricing practices, and resistance against right-to-repair, restricting capabilities over non-MFi cables would not come as a surprise. It should also be noted that other manufacturers routinely use their own cable standards, meaning Apple would not be alone in such a move.

Could Apple get away with this move?

According to the leaker, Apple will enforce this requirement via software to detect what type of cable is being used and effectively penalise those who opt for a third-party cable. Some online users have pointed out that if this software limitation is incorporated into Apple products, then it would violate EU law, citing that the purpose of forcing USB-C will prevent manufacturers from unfairly limiting charging speeds and data rates. However, it appears that the legislation states that it will “help prevent” as opposed to outlaw, meaning it could be perfectly legal.

With all things considered, if Apple does indeed go through with this plan, nothing will likely be done for a few years before the EU files a lawsuit. This will undoubtedly result in a fine, which Apple will fight to reduce and eventually pay after massive profits have been made. But, just like BatteryGate, Apple’s image could be tarnished by such a move, especially considering that the world is becoming more environmentally conscious.

All of this is speculation, and just because someone with credibility has supposedly leaked information internal to Apple doesn’t make any of this true. It is possible that one engineer internally to Apple mentioned how this could be done but never got passed the drawing board. It could also be disgruntled environmentalists looking to harm a successful business simply because they disagree with Apple’s repair policy.",Apple vs EU: The Battle Over USB-C Standards & E-Waste Reduction

Customers can use their own implements and tools to complete their repairs or rent custom-made toolkits for £54.90 for a week, as part of efforts to keep mobiles and computers in use for longer.

Jeff Williams, Apple’s chief operating officer, said: “We believe the best technology for our customers and for the planet is technology that lasts, which is why we design our products to be durable and rarely require maintenance or repair.

It seems the company knows that it fails to reach these consumers — Apple once considered releasing a plastic iPad with a keyboard to compete with Chromebooks. It never happened, but maybe it should have.

A plastic iPad bundled with a cheaper keyboard

According to a recent Bloomberg report, Apple has internally considered launching an iPad with a plastic back (which I assume would look like a giant iPhone 5c). But more than that, this iPad would also come with a plastic keyboard included in the box.

With this product, Apple wanted to compete in the Chromebook segment, which costs less than $200 depending on the model. The goal was to sell the plastic iPad plus keyboard for less than $500. This project never saw the light of day until now, and the report says that the idea was probably “abandoned” by Apple.

Still, it’s clear that Apple wants to compete with cheaper tablets and laptops in some way. It’s no wonder that the ninth-generation iPad remains in lineup for the same $329 as before, while the iPad 10 was released for $449. The company is quite aware that its new product is not exactly appealing to schools.

Where the iPad fails as an alternative for schools

To be fair, I don’t think the problem is the price of the iPad itself, although the new iPad 10 is quite expensive for what it offers. The $329 ninth-generation iPad certainly has more capable hardware than most Chromebooks in the same price category. But Apple definitely has a weak spot when it comes to iPad accessories.

Even Chromebooks that cost less than $200 are equipped with a keyboard and trackpad by default. On the other hand, Apple doesn’t ship any of the iPads with a keyboard.

Let’s take the new 10th-generation iPad as an example. It is priced at $449 for its 64GB Wi-Fi version, but many students will also want a keyboard to use it as a laptop. Apple’s new Smart Keyboard Folio, which is a full keyboard with a trackpad, costs $249. This puts the iPad 10 in the $700 price range, which is almost the price of an M1 MacBook Air.

For iPad 9, Apple still sells the original Smart Keyboard (with no trackpad) for $159. It is definitely cheaper than Apple’s fancier keyboards but still costs almost the same as an entire Chromebook. Together, iPad 9 plus Smart Keyboard cost at least $488. And, if you consider the Apple Pencil price, that’s $99 more.

Microsoft sells its own keyboard with built-in trackpad for the $399 Surface Go tablet for less than $100. At this point, the full iPad kit is much more expensive than its competitors. Regular consumers certainly don’t mind spending more for an iPad, but this is not the case for many schools and students.

How could Apple change this?

The idea of having a plastic iPad may not be the best way to push the iPad into the entry level tablet market. After all, the $329 iPad is made of aluminum. However, there are a few things the company could do to make the iPad more appealing to students.

Personally, I think Apple should focus on having only one entry-level model instead of two. A $399 price point would be a sweet spot for iPad 10. But more than that, Magic Keyboard Folio should cost much less than $249 – I’d suggest $159 at most. This way, consumers would have an iPad plus keyboard combo for under $560 that can compete even with mid-range laptops.

And if Apple really wants to keep selling its old iPads with a decade-old design like iPad 9, it should start at $299 with Smart Keyboard priced at $99. This combo would make the entry-level iPad more appealing particularly in emerging markets, where iPads can cost up to three times as much as entry-level Windows laptops.

Now there is Daisy, or rather double Daisy, Dave, and Taz. These aren't members of a manufactured pop band but rather Apple's evolving team of advanced de-manufacturing robots.

For the last six years, Apple has been on a mission to develop far more sophisticated and less wasteful machinery and processes for recycling e-waste, specifically that found in redundant iPhones. And that de-manufacturing idea is key.

Apple Daisy and team battle e-waste

(Image credit: Apple)

Most e-waste recycling is an exercise in relatively crude crushing and crunching. It renders smartphones – an estimated 12 per cent of all e-waste – and other technology so much fiddly fragments. This makes sorting, separating, retrieving, and recycling precious metals and materials tricky to impossible. Daisy and team have been designed to take apart iPhones with (almost) as much care and attention as they were put together.

As part of its broader material recovery strategy, Apple identified 14 priority materials – from metals including gold and tungsten to paper – that make up 90 per cent of the ingredients used in its devices and packaging, many of which were being recovered in low quantities, in low quality or not at all by existing recycling methods.

An efficient way to pick iPhones apart

The extraction of many of these materials carries a high social as well as environmental cost. Around five per cent of an iPhone’s weight is cobalt. And 60 per cent of the world’s increasingly scarce cobalt is mined, often by hand and in terrible conditions, in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

The problem with recovering these materials from a smartphone is that it packs them, in secure and complex ways, in a very small space. An iPhone is more than a powerful computer, chips and circuit boards, it is a camera, music player and more. The camera module alone contains tin, copper, gold and other rare earth materials. There are also lenses and tiny speakers to retrieve and disassemble. Apple needed to find an efficient way to pick iPhones apart.

Set up in 2016, Liam was Apple’s first stab at a robot-manned de-manufacturing line. It could only handle iPhone 5s and it took 12 minutes to dissemble each one. This was unfeasibly slow but worked as a proof of concept. Liam 2.0 was a full 30m long, employing a row of 29 separate robots. It sped up the de-production process, but one fundamental time-sucking problem was holding it back. Robots make slow work of unscrewing tiny screws. Liam was replaced by Daisy in 2018 and it abandoned delicacy and applied brute force, simply punching a hole around screws. This was the key feasibility unlock.

A 10m-long, five-robot reverse production line, Daisy is made up of four cells that break down an iPhone into 15 component parts. Cell one opens up the phone, another uses minus-80-degree Celsius cold air to nullify the adhesive that attaches the battery to the housing, another punches out screws, while the final cell separates components from the housing. Armed with sophisticated AI, Daisy can now identify 23 different models of iPhone and process one every 18 seconds, in whatever order they come.

Robot Dave, meanwhile, tackles the iPhone's 'Taptic Engine' to recover tungsten, copper and gold and its steel enclosure. Taz then separates magnets from plastics in speakers. Humans appear at the end of the chain to manually sort and separate materials.

Towards circularity

That might seem like a lot of effort but – given the colossal wastefulness of extraction – Daisy and co have an outsize impact. One metric ton of recovered iPhone parts avoids the mining of 2,000 metric tons of metal-rich rock.

Daisy is sold as a key part of Apple’s progress towards full circularity. It hasn’t put a timescale on achieving that goal and many commentators argue that, given the complexities of Apple’s resource-hungry products and its supply chain, it’s an all-but-impossible dream. Apple, though, has made advances. It has been using recycled tungsten since iPhone 12 and 100 per cent recycled certified gold since iPhone 13. In the financial year 2021, 20 per cent of material Apple shipped came from recycled sources and the 13-inch MacBook Air has 40 per cent recycled content. It has also been investing in establishing industry-wide bona fides for recycled material.

The problem for Apple, leaving it open to accusations that Daisy is more PR stunt than practical solution, is the limited supply of old, unrepairable or un-resalable devices. There’s currently one Daisy in the Netherlands to handle permanently retired European iPhones and another in Texas at Apple's Material Recovery Lab, helping take care of US business. A single Daisy could disassemble up to 1.2 million iPhones every year and Apple is keen to have four of five Daisies up and running as soon as possible. At the moment, though, neither Daisy is working at anywhere near full capacity.

Too many of us stash our old phones away in drawers or use third-party trade-in services. The battle now is to incentivise people to return phones to Apple so they can be refurbed – in the 2021 fiscal year, Apple sent 12.2 million refurbed devices to good new homes – or fed to Daisy. Apple does now have its own trade-in service, which can be used to offset the cost of an upgrade. And in the 2021 financial year that helped push 38,000 metric tonnes of e-waste to recycling.

While notorious for its privacy around product development, Apple is open-sourcing the tricks and technology behind its materials recovery programme, hoping that other tech companies and recycling specialists will adopt, adapt and perhaps even advance those processes. Critics argue that Daisy clones are too expensive an option for third-party recyclers and none have, as yet, taken up the option to create one.

iPhone 12: ready for recycling? (Image credit: press)

On a more positive note, and despite the yearly roll-out of faster, smarter best-ever devices, more and more of us are holding on to our phones for longer. Upgrades now feel more like marginal gains than absolute musts. And Apple insists that durability and longevity of devices is now a priority. It has also gone some way to answering the demands of the ‘right to repair’ movement. Early last year it made spare parts and repair manuals for the iPhone 12 and 13 available in the US, a service that will soon be extended to the iPhone 14 and some MacBooks. It went live in Europe and the UK in early December.

Of course, Apple is still very much in the business of selling new iPhones. It is estimated that 240m were sold in 2021, despite the pandemic, and iPhone sales account for over half of Apple’s revenue. Efficiently dealing with smartphone e-waste is only going to become more of a problem. It is, though, also big, profitable business – if done properly – and recycling specialists are making advances. Daisy isn’t the only show in town. But while a Daisy army might not be the sole solution to putting smartphone parts back into circulation, they are the smartest, sharpest tool available.

According to a notification appearing on the app’s home screen, Dark Sky will no longer be available as of January 1, 2023, as its forecasting technology has now been integrated with Apple’s own Weather application.

The news is not surprising, though it is disappointing.

Following the acquisition, Apple promptly wound down the Android and Wear OS versions of Dark Sky and said it would no longer accept signups for Dark Sky’s API, which had allowed third-party app developers to access the company’s database of weather forecasts and historical weather data. It later pushed back the API service’s closure until the end of 2022, and said the iOS app would shut down around the same time.

The writing was on the wall. After all, Dark Sky’s app had not been the key focus for Apple’s deal — it was the forecasting technology and the weather service itself.

Apple saw the potential in turning Dark Sky’s API into its own revenue-generating business. Previously, that API had offered 1,000 API calls for free, then charged $0.0001 for each subsequent call. At Apple’s WWDC 2022, alongside the launch of a default weather app for iPad, Apple announced it would transition the API’s paying customers to its new weather service, WeatherKit, where it would provide up to 500,000 API calls per month as part of its Apple Developer Program membership during the beta period and beyond.

It will then go on to charge businesses for additional data at the following rates:

1 million calls/month: US$49.99

2 million calls/month: US$99.99

5 million calls/month: US$249.99

10 million calls/month: US$499.99

20 million calls/month: US$999.99

As of yesterday’s iOS 16 launch, Apple also officially launched its WeatherKit subscriptions, noting developers could now access this weather data in apps built for iOS 16, iPadOS 16, macOS 13, tvOS 16 and watchOS 9 with a platform-specific Swift API and for other platforms with a REST API. Developers can upgrade for more calls or downgrade at any time via the Account tab in the Apple Developer app, the company noted.

Given this service is now live and integrated with Apple’s Weather app, it’s understandable that Apple will close Dark Sky’s iOS app. But the interesting thing here is that even though the Dark Sky app is directly pointing users to the Apple Weather app as part of its notification to existing users, Apple doesn’t necessarily have to convince those users to make the switch in order to benefit.

Because Apple bought Dark Sky’s backend weather data service, it will now have the chance to generate revenue whenever users turn to another third-party weather app that’s tapping into WeatherKit. For now, it’s unclear how many former Dark Sky API customers will make that transition, however, as the WeatherKit service has just gone live.

It is a shame to see Dark Sky’s consumer-facing product go, however. The well-designed app has been a longtime favorite for many, thanks to its easy-to-read user interface with tappable buttons for quickly swapping between forecasts for the day’s temperatures, precipitation probability, humidity, UV Index, and more, as well as its radar maps and customizable notifications. According to data from mobile intelligence firm Sensor Tower, the iOS app has seen nearly 2 million downloads to date

Thankfully, there’s still an ecosystem of third-party weather apps available that bring a little more visual flair to forecasts, if Apple’s own weather app doesn’t inspire. Among our favorites: CARROT Weather, (Not Boring) Weather, MyRadar and Clime (if you’re willing to subscribe).","As Apple’s WeatherKit launches, Dark Sky for iOS to wind down operations by year-end"

You can still buy the Apple Watch Series 3, even though Apple no longer supports it.

We've seen refurbished Series 3 models priced at $100, but you should avoid this outdated model.

For a budget Apple Watch with better value, we recommend the 2022 Apple Watch SE instead.

The Apple Watch Series 3 was discontinued in September 2022, but you can still buy it refurbished from various sellers for as low as $100. Regardless of how attractive it's priced, we don't recommend buying it.

There are two main reasons: Apple no longer supports the Series 3 with software and security updates, and while still functional, the smartwatch is showing its age. Plus, its 8GB of built-in storage (16GB in the cellular model) is now too small to be meaningful.

Instead, we recommend these newer models that offer better performance and support. And if you're looking to buy an Apple Watch on a budget, the second-generation Apple Watch SE (2022) should be at the top of your shortlist.

Apple Watch SE (2022) The second-generation Apple Watch SE is Apple’s new reigning budget smartwatch. It’s an impressive entry-level wearable that shares the same processor as the Series 8 and Ultra. It doesn’t have the most advanced health sensors as premium models, but it offers just enough features to satisfy most people.

The second-generation Apple Watch SE offers a lot of value for a new entry-level model

The 2022 Apple Watch SE is a budget option with significantly better value than the Series 3. Antonio Villas-Boas

The 2022 Watch SE replaced the Series 3 as the entry-level Apple Watch. Like the Series 3, the SE is a capable smartwatch that tells the time, delivers notifications, and tracks your fitness and health. You can make or take calls when your iPhone is nearby, or buy the cellular option if you want to leave your phone at home. It supports Apple Pay for mobile payments. It includes a heart-rate sensor for high and low heart rate notifications, irregular rhythm notifications, workouts, GPS location tracking, Emergency SOS, and water resistance.

But the SE also adds Crash Detection as a new safety feature and cycle tracking for health. It's also sleeker with a slightly larger, higher-quality display, and it has 32GB for storage. Most importantly, the SE uses the latest S8 processor, which delivers the fastest performance and reliability in an Apple Watch, and it'll also last longer due to having the latest specs.

Starting at $249 for the 40mm model and $279 for the 44mm, the second-gen SE is a better value than the Series 3 if you're on a budget. While the SE lacks an always-on display and additional health and fitness features you'd find on the Series 8 or Ultra, it's still one of the best new smartwatches you can buy.

Should you buy the Apple Watch Series 3 for any reason?

Considering that the Apple Watch Series 3 is still functional and very good for the most basic tasks, some buyers might overlook its discontinued support. Perhaps you need to replace a damaged Series 3 and aren't ready to upgrade yet, or you're gifting one to a child. Whatever the reason, we think it no longer holds its value, and there's no guarantee that it'll work as well as time goes on.",Why you shouldn't waste your money on the Apple Watch Series 3 in 2023

A “test balloon” hack on England’s Cybersecurity Division leaves surly director Richard Banks (Peter Mullan) shaken. His associate Alison Rowdy (Green) agrees, and the two begin investigating as more and more cyberattacks lead to train derailments and flooding from the Thames.

Meanwhile, in Damascus, French military contractor Gabriel Delage (Cassel) is tasked with protecting a pair of Syrian white-hat hackers and the information they’ve unveiled about the hacks. Things go poorly, as predicted, and Gabriel ends up back in London to track them down again—ending right back in Alison’s orbit. You see, a lifetime ago, they were lovers in an anti-war activist group. Everything went to pot during a particularly flammable street protest, and the two parted ways. Now, they’ve got to work together to save themselves, the hackers, and, it seems, the world.

If “Liaison” got to this point earlier, with Green and Cassel glowering at each other with white-hot erotic heat as they dug barbs out of their scarred backs or made out while gunfire raged around them, it could have been quite the pulpy ride. Unfortunately, Brac’s expanded scope involves reams of scenes in conference rooms, offices, and hideouts, with an expanding cast of unremarkable character actors playing nondescript government flacks and corporate spies.

They all have overlapping motivations and allegiances, fighting for their slice of the hack-attack pie. It’s all so dull, and it goes on for far too long. (Even stalwarts like Kieslowski regular Irène Jacob get lost in all the boring bureaucracy.)

Are you finding yourself scrambling for storage on your iPhone? Do you regularly have to deal with annoying Storage Full pop-ups that appear just when you’re ready to download an app or take an important photo or video? The solution may not be what you think it is. Even though Apple offers storage solutions, Tech Expert David Brayton, author of Electricalwheel.com, says you should never waste your money on this storage upgrade.

What Is A Storage Upgrade In Apple?

First thing’s first: what exactly is a storage upgrade in Apple? “The storage upgrade in a device is an increase in the amount of space that is available for storing data,” Brayton said. “This can be accomplished by adding more memory to the device, or by using a larger capacity storage device such as a hard drive.”

According to Brayton, you should never waste your money on this storage upgrade for two primary reasons:

“First, upgrading your storage is not going to improve your overall system performance,” Brayton said. “Sure, you may get a slight boost in speed, but it’s not going to be significant enough to warrant the cost of the upgrade. Second, most people never come close to using all the storage they have available to them. Unless you’re a power user with a lot of demanding applications, you’ll likely find that your current storage capacity is more than sufficient.”

What You Should Do Instead To Gain Back Storage

Don’t worry, if you’re looking to gain back storage on your iPhone, there are a few things you can do. First, take a look at what’s taking up the most space on your device, Brayton recommends. “If you have a lot of music or photos, consider storing them elsewhere, like in the cloud or on an external drive,” Brayton said. “You can also delete any unused apps or clear out old files and data that you no longer need.”

Another option is to upgrade to a larger-capacity iPhone. “This way, you’ll have more space for the things you want to keep on your device,” Brayton said. “Whatever route you choose, make sure you’re proactive about gaining back storage on your iPhone so you can keep using it without issue.”

You don’t have to deal with constant storage pop-ups — take proactive steps that free up space or plan in advance if you suspect you’ll need more space.",Apple Experts Say You Should Never Waste Your Money On This Storage Upgrade

This increase in production, along with factors such as uncontrolled urbanization and the lack of appropriate waste management and recycling methods, leads to the accumulation of waste in the environment, which causes irreversible environmental damages1. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the production of fruits and vegetables in the world is more than 1.74 billion tons, of which 10–50 percent of it is wasted in different countries. The value of food waste in the world is estimated at US$ 1 trillion annually. The resources used to produce that amount of wasted food are responsible for the emission of 4.4 gigatons of greenhouse gases (equivalent to CO 2 ) per year, making wasted food the third-largest producer of greenhouse gases in the world after China and the United States2.

The extent of food losses varies at different stages of the production chain depending on the type of product, the level of economic development, and the social and cultural conditions in a geographical area. In the case of fruits and vegetables, according to the FAO study, wastage in the harvesting, sorting, and grading stages is predominant in industrial areas. In developing areas, while food loss is high during the harvesting, sorting, and grading stages, the amount of wastage during the processing stage (14–21%) is much higher than in developed areas (less than 2%)2,3. This is while most fruit products are processed before consumption, so in addition to increasing the value, also maintains the quality and number of fruits on the market4. Large amounts of waste are accumulated during the processing, which imposes high costs for treatments to reduce environmental detriment5,6. Thus, fruit processing waste not only accounts for significant amounts of food waste, which means serious environmental damage but also indicates the loss of nutrients of high value7. Therefore, the conversion of waste into value-added products is important and necessary to improve the sustainability and efficiency of the food supply chain8.

Over the years, in numerous studies, the production of value-added products, through microbial conversion or enzymatic processes of fruit wastes such as enzymes, bioethanol, organic acids, heteropolysaccharides, aromatic compounds, protein-fortified feed, prebiotic oligosaccharides, and bioactive compounds, has been investigated9. Microbial processing of residual fruit fibers is a relatively new approach that uses waste as monomers for the synthesis of natural beneficial oligomers10.

In general, the structure of the fruit is composed of various compounds with different properties. After water, the highest abundance belongs to carbohydrates, which make up 50 to 80% of the dry weight in most fruits11. A large number of carbohydrates in fruit waste are types of dietary fiber, of which pectin makes up to 40% of the compounds12. Pectins are a family of high molecular weight acidic polysaccharides, which are abundant in the primary cell wall of plants, made primarily from d-galacturonic acid units in the main chain with α (1-4) linkage along with small amounts of rhamnose in the main chain and arabinose, galactose and xylose in the side chains10,13. Several studies have demonstrated the applications of pectin in the food and pharmaceutical industries. Studies have suggested that short-chain pectins have wider applications, such as prebiotic, anti-cancer agents, drug delivery systems, radical scavenging properties, cholesterol-lowering, etc., and those features are related to the structure and molecular weight of pectic compounds10,14.

Radical species are associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, diabetes, inflammation, cardiovascular disease, and myocardial infarction. Synthetic antioxidants commonly used in manufacturing processes are considered to be the cause of cytotoxicity. On the other hand, natural polysaccharides are considered to be reliable antioxidants that can scavenge free radicals and overcome synthetic substances that pose health concerns. The compounds rich in rhamnogalacturonan I as well as the compounds consisting of homogalacturonan in the main chain and rhamnogalacturonan I and arabinogalactan in the side chains show the highest level of antioxidant properties; Therefore, the antioxidant properties of pectic compounds can be traced to the structure of rhamnogalacturonan I, homogalacturonan and arabinogalactan15. Oligogalacturonic acids derived from pectin, modified by various treatments also can purify compounds including anion superoxide, hydroxyl, and reactive oxygen species. They also increase the antioxidant properties of enzymes: superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase and show antioxidant properties by increasing the amount of glutathione16.

Another promising biological activity of pectin is its potential role in preventing and reducing carcinogenesis. The positive effects of “modified pectin”, whether in the form of commercial products such as modified citrus pectin (e.g. GCS-100, FPP, or pectasol) or laboratory-modified pectin, have been studied and proven. Citrus modified pectin (MCP) in particular has been and is under extensive research17. Not all MCPs are the same because the term is used to describe water-soluble polysaccharides derived from pectin produced from citrus peel and pulp treated with high temperature, high pH, or enzymatic decomposition. pH-modified citrus pectin has reduced molecular weight and is derived from commercial citrus pectin and has galactose-rich side chains that are capable of binding to the prometastatic protein galactin-3 and inhibiting tumor cell metastasis. Galactin-3 plays a key role in several intracellular physiological and pathological processes, including tumor cell proliferation and apoptosis. The binding of MCP to galactin-3 may inhibit the negative effects of galactin-3, such as inhibiting its ability to promote adhesion and migration of tumor cells and prevent apoptosis. In addition to galactose-rich side chains, the homogalacturonan part of pectin also has anti-cancer activity. Low molecular weight pectin fragments (1 kDa) rich in galacturonic acid were absorbed by mouse and human cancer cells, which inhibited the growth of these cells and led to the release of lactate dehydrogenase and galactin-3 from them. In addition to interacting with galactin-3, some other potential anticancer effects of modified pectins have been reported in both in vitro and in vivo conditions18. Low molecular weight citrus fractionated pectin powder (FPP) produced by autoclave hydrolysis or a combination of heating and enzymatic hydrolysis also induces androgen and androgen-independent prostate cancer cell apoptosis. MCPs produced by enzymatic degradation of pectasol, induced apoptosis in prostate cancer cells and increased the doubling time of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in patients undergoing various treatments used to treat prostate cancer. Enzymatically hydrolyzed citrus pectin has also been shown to have clinical benefits, improved quality of life, and reduced pain in patients with advanced tumors in various types of cancer19.

Pectins can be degraded to pectic oligosaccharides (POS) by various degradation methods such as enzymatic hydrolysis, acid hydrolysis, hydrothermal processing, high-pressure microfluidization, or photochemical reaction in TiO 2 -containing medium10,20. Enzymatic methods have significant advantages over other methods, such as: (1) the reaction is performed under mild operating conditions, (2) the hydrolysis medium does not cause corrosion, (3) no toxic or contaminating chemicals are used (4) hydrolysis is selective and affects only specific constituent units or bonds, as expected for an enzyme-catalyzed reaction; (5) reaction efficiency may be higher than that achievable by, chemical methods and (6) the formation of unwanted products is avoided21. Pectinolytic enzymes are classified into two main groups: (a) esterases including pectin methyl esterase, and (b) depolymerase including hydrolase and lyase22. Many fungal species can break down pectin by producing different pectinolytic enzymes. Studies have shown that Alternaria sesami produces pectinolytic enzymes including polygalacturonase transeliminases, pectin transeliminases, and polygalacturonases23. Elrod reported for the first time that the Erwinia bacterium could degrade pectin23. Zucker et al.24 and Chatterjee et al.25 demonstrated the production of induced and extracellular endopolygalacturonase by Pseudomonas fluorescens and Erwinia.

Alcaligenes faecalis as a member of Alcaligenaceae from Betaproteobacteria class has many applications in biotechnology and food and health industries. Alcaligenes spp. has been used in the production of plastic-like storage material, enzymes, polysaccharides, and also commercial production of amino acids as food additives26.

As a member of Paenibacillaceae from the Bacilli class, Paenibacillus polymyxa is involved in a variety range of physiological and biotechnological processes. Different strains of this bacteria can be used in nitrogen fixation, antibiotics production, and phosphorus solubilization in the soil. P. polymyxa is known to produce cell wall degrading enzymes with hydrolytic pathways. Different strains of P. polymyxa were reported to produce exopolysaccharides (EPS) which as a secondary metabolite have a wide range of applications in bioindustries27.

In the current study A. faecalis, AGS3 and P. polymyxa S4 were isolated and identified. The objective of this study was to investigate microbial degradation of pectin by pectinase of isolated bacterial isolates A. faecalis AGS3 and P. polymyxa S4 and for the first time identify products and then investigate the anticancer and antioxidative properties of obtained compounds.",Investigation of bioactivity of unsaturated oligo‑galacturonic acids produced from apple waste by Alcaligenes faecalis AGS3 and Paenibacillus polymyxa S4 Pectinases

Recycled newspaper has traditionally been the main ingredient of so-called molded pulp packaging products, which have become increasingly popular because they are compostable. But the supply of recycled newspaper is in decline, creating a market for substitute materials.

Yanyun Zhao, an Oregon State professor who leads a research team focusing on sustainable food packaging and processing, has studied apple pomace and other byproducts from processing fruit and vegetable juice and winemaking as an alternative for recycled newspaper in molded pulp manufacturing. She and the team received a patent for this research.

“Right now, apple pomace is typically just composted or used for animal feed,” said Zhao, whose research aims to reduce food loss and waste across the food supply chain. “We thought why not turn it into an environmentally friendly product that meets an industry need.”

Zhao envisions apple pomace being the main ingredient for molded pulp packing products such as take-out containers, flower pots, beverage cartons and bottles and clamshell packaging used for fruits and vegetables.

She is focused on apple pomace, in part, because it is readily available in the Pacific Northwest. When apples are processed for juice about 70-75% of the apple goes into the juice, leaving the remaining 25-30% as pomace.

One of the key problems to solve in creating pomace and paper-based packaging is improving water resistance so that it could withstand high moisture, liquid food or non-food items and products stored under high humidity conditions.

In a just-published paper in Food and Bioproducts Processing, the team sought to create eco-friendly, bio-based, compostable and cost-effective solutions that would improve the hydrophobicity, or water resistance, of the apple pomace-based molded pulp products.

They used two strategies: incorporating polymers and compounds with characteristics to improve water resistance into the pulp formulation and applying superhydrophobic coatings on the product surface. The polymers and compounds studied include lignin, chitosan and glycerol.

Lignin is a polymer that forms key structural materials in the support tissues of most plants. Rhubarb pomace, which is particularly lignin rich, was used in this study.

Chitosan is a bio-based polymer commonly used in the papermaking industry. A previous study from Zhao’s team found that chitosan reduced water absorption of cellulose nanofiber (CNF) films significantly through adsorption of chitosan onto CNF fibers via hydrogen bonds.

Finally, glycerol is an organic compound often added to a material to make it softer and more flexible. Previous studies had shown that at low levels glycerol decreased water absorption.

The researchers determined the optimal amounts of those polymers and compounds while also adding a small amount of cardboard fiber for stability of the molded pulp packaging products.

Zhao’s team has a long history of studying food coatings as a barrier to water and gases. The team had previously created a two-step preparation of superhydrophobic coating that is heat, cold and water resistant. They applied a simplified, one-step coating on the surface of the apple pomace-based product to enhance water resistance.

They concluded that the study demonstrated the feasibility of using fruit pomace as a new source of fiber in producing molded pulp packaging and effective approaches to enhancing water resistance in those packaging materials.

Updated Friday, July 15: The update includes the proposed bi-monthly fee for the commonly-used 95-gallon barrel for residential customers.

The town of Apple Valley has announced a proposed rate increase for Burrtec Waste Industries services.

The town’s involvement with Burrtec includes billing customers directly for the waste services provided under the franchise agreement.

The proposed fee increase would help Burrtec recover from the rising cost of service caused mainly by inflation and the implementation of commercial food/green waste recycling required under state law, town officials said.

Burrtec offers rate structure fees for solid waste services, which include residential, multi-family, and commercial.

If adopted, the new bi-monthly fee for the commonly-used 95-gallon barrel for residential customers would increase from $59.04 to $72.74, a difference of $13.70.

The 60-gallon barrel would go from $53.56 to $67.54, an increase of $13.98, and the 40-gallon type, from $50.76 to $64.92, an increase of $14.16.

Proposed fee increases for commercial trash bin service are based on the size of the bin and the frequency of service/pick-ups.

For a one day pickup, a 1.5 size commercial bin would increase from $69.19 to $71.89, 2.0 size $91.56 to $95.17, 3.0 size $136.26 to $141.63 and a 4.0 size bin $181.09 to $188.24.

Some of the additional proposed fee increases would affect commercial barrels, commercial compactor trash services, recycling commercial bin services, and food waste bins.

To view the full list of proposed rate increases, visit applevalley.org/services/solid-waste-trash.

Proposition 218 protest

The proposed rate increases will be adopted and go into effect on Sept. 1 unless written protests against increases are presented by a majority of property owners (50% +1).

Town officials said they are conducting a Proposition 218 majority protest proceeding out of an abundance of caution and without conceding the applicability of the proposition to the franchise agreement.

The Town has scheduled a public hearing at 6:30 p.m. on August 23 for Burrtec/town staff to make a presentation regarding the proposed increases and for citizens to offer comments.

To submit written comments, email the town clerk at publiccomment@applevalley.org by noon on Aug. 23 and indicate whether you want your comments read aloud or forwarded to the council.

The meeting will be conducted inside council chambers at Apple Valley Town Hall, 14955 Dale Evans Parkway.

The full agenda and meeting can also be viewed online at AppleValley.org, on Frontier Channel 29, or Charter Spectrum Channel 186.

Apple Valley residents speak out

Several residents contacted the Daily Press regarding the proposed increases, including James Simon, who called the possible action by Burrtec “a sign of the times.”

“With the rising price of fuel, everything has or is going up,” said the 52-year-old Simon. “Burrtec, Southern California Edison, Southwest Gas and other utility companies are probably taking a hit so I can understand them wanting to raise prices.”

Simmons, who also has a home in Pomona, said his bi-monthly residential rate for waste pick-up is about $67 for a standard waste barrel.

“There are many retired and disabled citizens residing in Apple Valley who live on fixed incomes and are already suffering under the burden of the highly inflated gasoline prices,” Rick Van Stralen told the Daily Press.

Van Stralen added that fuel costs are already passed along on every product that is purchased and inflation is “already hurting us terribly. This proposed rate increase only creates more pain.”

“We are required under the Apple Valley Municipal code to subscribe to Burrtec’s service, so we are forced to accept whatever rate the Town Council decides to force upon us,” Van Stralen said.

He also added that between the “high cost of water through Liberty Utilities” and now the proposed increases in trash service, along with inflation, they have to choose between paying for certain costs or bills.

It continues to disclose impressive progress.

And slowly but surely, other multinationals including Walmart, PepsiCo and more than a dozen global pharmaceutical companies including Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer and AstraZeneca are embracing similar strategies.

All of these corporations have taken recent steps to create general resources and tools for their value chain and suppliers, with an eye to improving their energy efficiency and helping them procure renewable electricity through a variety of avenues. Some have even committed to helping suppliers orchestrate aggregated power purchase agreements (PPAs).

Although I haven’t actually seen any examples of those sorts of PPAs yet, PepsiCo hopes its value chain will come together on at least one collective contract by the end of the year, according to Roberta Barbieri, vice president of global water and environmental solutions at the company. If all of PepsiCo’s partners switched to renewable electricity — including those aiding with transportation, packaging, bottling and so on — the company would be well on its way to achieving its own goals, she told me earlier this week: ""Scope 3 needs to be dealt with, and it is the most challenging part of a decarbonization strategy, bar none.""

The SME factor

Remember two years ago when declaring an intention to become net zero by 2050 became all the rage with large corporations? Scrutiny of those commitments by investors, climate activists and the media has made one thing increasingly clear — big companies won’t get there without small and midsize enterprises (SMEs), and most SMEs don’t have the resources to do this on their own.

According to a recent survey conducted by the SME Climate Hub, an initiative managed by the We Mean Business Coalition, about two-thirds of small businesses believe they don’t have the right skills or tools to act. Close to 70 percent of those surveyed said they need access to external funds to take action, but just one-third of the small respondent base (about 200 businesses) had been offered a financial incentive to do so.

That’s one reason why Apple’s active role in enabling suppliers to transition to renewable electricity is so notable. In mid-April, the company reported that its suppliers had more than doubled their use of clean energy over the past 12 months — with 10 gigawatts online and a total of 16 GW committed into the future. As of the report date, 213 of the company’s ""major manufacturing partners"" had made commitments to operate all of their Apple-related production on renewable electricity. (No specific goal date provided.)

In China in particular, Apple has played an active role in helping its supply chain partners. In 2018, it created a $300 million fund to directly invest in projects that could benefit its suppliers (465 megawatts so far), and it has also helped them navigate some regulatory challenges of this market.

Plugging into value chains

Walmart also supports an initiative to help suppliers to procure renewable electricity. The two-year-old effort, Gigaton PPA, is a component of Walmart’s Project Gigaton, which aims to avoid 1 gigaton (1 billion metric tons) of CO2 from the retailer’s value chain by 2030. The initiative provides education, but it also seeks to encourage participants to collaborate on aggregate PPAs — allowing several smaller companies to pool their renewable electricity procurement requirements and negotiate together.

While there haven’t been any group PPAs announced by Walmart yet, it’s just a matter of time, according to John Powers, vice president of global renewables and cleantech at Schneider Electric. ""That is well underway. We are hoping to have something to announce this year,"" he told me.

Schneider Electric has advised corporations on more than 150 utility-scale PPA purchases in North America, Europe, India, Australia and Latin America — influencing the addition of more than 11,000 MW. Aside from the Walmart program, it is also behind a similar initiative announced in March by PepsiCo, pep+ REnew. There are two primary components to the newer program, which draws on resources provided by the energy service provider’s NEO Network: providing educational tools to help SMEs learn more about their renewable options and accelerating the shift to renewables by helping PepsiCo’s value chain partners identify projects and collaborate on aggregated PPAs. This program is in addition to an initiative PepsiCo started last year with research firm Guidehouse, designed to help suppliers set science-based targets.

When I spoke with Barbieri earlier this week, 45 of its partners — of all sizes — had joined the program and the company had hosted hundreds more as part of introductory webinars. The program is funded out of the sustainability team’s budget, but it is being managed by someone on PepsiCo’s procurement team. ""We developed the concept, and others are operationalizing it,"" she said.

While there are no specific key performance indicators for the initiative currently, Barbieri hopes it will yield its first aggregated PPA within a year. ""By aggregating companies to do this, you share the burden of all the intricacies and complexities. Schneider can help,"" she said.

While PepsiCo opted to get this program off the ground on its own, Schneider Electric is also at the center of a collaborative initiative established in November by 10 global pharmaceutical companies including AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, Merck and Pfizer. Energize encourages suppliers to learn about the renewables market, receive guidance on PPAs and potentially collaborate on procurement contracts. Because many of these suppliers often work with multiple customers across the same industry, it has the potential to scale quickly, Powers noted.

So, are programs of this nature the start of something big or, rather, small? Powers said Schneider Electric is fielding more inquiries from sustainability leaders seeking to motivate progress on Scope 3 emissions. ""There is a large demand to figure out solutions for everyone beyond just the biggest, most sophisticated companies in the world,"" he said.","Apple, Walmart, PepsiCo offer suppliers leg up on renewable electricity"

Under her, Apple committed to the ambitious goal of achieving carbon neutrality across its global supply chain and the life cycle of every product by 2030. Nandagopal Rajan spoke to her during her visit to New Delhi. Edited excerpts:

Where is Apple in its journey towards achieving carbon neutrality?

We are doing well. We set the goal in 2020… it was a 10-year goal at the time. So we are in year three of a 10-year goal. I’m really proud of the fact that we have seen carbon emissions continue to decrease across the company, except for the last environment report where carbon emissions actually stayed the same. But our production went way up, we made and sold a lot more devices. We call that decoupling, we were able to separate how much we make and sell from how our carbon intensity is. We are about to release our next environment report.. we always do that around mid-April for Earth Day… and there will be some good news there as well. It’s a very aggressive goal, but we are gonna make it, we have to make it.

Did Covid become a hurdle in this journey with supply chains and manufacturing impacted across the world?

At Apple, all of our supply chain and all of our users’ energy needs to be green. What’s been fascinating, of course, is that with COVID the world, in general, had to learn new ways to work so that we could continue to keep economies moving. It was no different for Apple, we actually had some pretty amazing innovations and products that were released during COVID. It’s been remarkable to watch the company move to a different way of working even in design and manufacturing. And so we have also had the same success with clean energy and with our climate goals as the company has continued to move. I would say it’s another innovation. It’s a challenge in terms of how to get it done. But we haven’t seen a huge slowdown and we don’t expect to see one. In fact, we have to keep moving quicker at this point.

At Apple, all of our supply chain and all of our users’ energy needs to be green, Lisa Jackson. At Apple, all of our supply chain and all of our users’ energy needs to be green, Lisa Jackson.

Does Apple have a blanket approach to environmental sustainability or is it a bit extra sensitive when it comes to some geographies?

We have to approach it where we are. I mean, we are a global company, but we have customers around the world. India is a great example. Here, we have customers and we hope that continues to grow but we also have manufacturing and offices where Apple employees come to work and every time we have an office, the energy that powers that office has to be renewable because that’s what we have pledged to do in 2030. And you can’t wait until 2029 to do the work.

One of the things I loved about the 2030 goal when we set it is that we knew Apple as a company would continue to grow. And we knew it meant that it was not a stagnant goal. Once you get to 100% renewable in India, it only lasts until the next office building opens or the next facility opens. When you get your manufacturing in India to 100% renewable, it’s only good until you add a new supplier. So it’s a very active, kinetic goal.

We really love that as we have more people who use our devices in India it means more power has to be green on the grid in order to make that power carbon neutral. What makes India so special is the government’s very strong commitment to solar, to low carbon energy. It’s like a wind at your back as you are trying to move it along. And we actually find, because the world has set this goal through the COP process, countries are taking it seriously and businesses know that governments are watching to make sure they are doing their part. We are saying if you want to do business with Apple, we expect you to take on the responsibility of climate change just as we have.

Is that more difficult to do in a country like India where you have a lot of support from the government, but the ecosystem itself is maybe just opening up to the concepts of renewable energy?

One thing that has surprised me has been how eager the people in our supply chain are to meet us and join us in the carbon-neutral goal. I won’t say it makes it easier, but everyone is pushing in the same direction. You don’t have people saying, I don’t want to be engaged in this, because they know the government expects it, not just Apple. So I wouldn’t say it’s harder… in some ways that make it easier because everyone knows that it has to be done in some ways. It makes it harder a little because there are so many things going on at the same time. People assume as soon as you leave the US, no one wants to do this work. It’s almost the opposite. Countries see an opportunity to leapfrog over traditional energy and go straight to renewable energy. There is a huge opportunity in that.

Do you think being carbon neutral, energy efficient and giving back to the community should be a standard approach for all companies? Is that even possible for all companies to do?

Every company should recognise in this day and age that your future and your ability to do business depends on people’s belief that you’re doing right by their community, by where you are working, by your workers, but also the communities around where you work. It’s sort of almost like permission to be there. You have to be, this is about our children. This is about future generations.

I think it should be standard that every company takes on the responsibility. I know that we at Apple hold ourselves to a very high standard in terms of when we say carbon neutral, we are not just gonna go out and buy offsets because we know that some offsets maybe are not high quality, you’re not really sure what you are getting. We do need to use some offsets as there are some emissions we just can’t stop at this point, we don’t have the technology.

But we are committed to innovation as a really important part of how we get to carbon neutral. Innovation in our materials innovation in the circular economy and recycling innovation across the board. And that’s kind of part of what makes Apple. I wish everyone would do it as we do. But part of what we are doing here is we are willing to share how we do it. We work with our supply chain to help them make the transition to clean energy and do it in a way that’s good for their business. At the end of the day, we have to find a way to do it within the business dynamics. The government has other imperatives and is helping with policies and economic incentives, but as a business, it’s how you take advantage of this opportunity.

How happy are you with the efforts in India?

At Apple, we have to have big goals and we have to work in big ways. We are not going to get to 2030 with tiny projects, but we also need to show up in communities. We need to show them the promise of clean energy, show them the promise of low carbon, and what it means for their community. In Maharashtra, where AERF (Applied Environmental Research Foundation) is working, the people may not know anything about carbon, but they know these mangroves are a source of livelihood and if there’s a way that a local fisherman can be paid to preserve them, it is additional pay and that supports their families. It also has the great advantage of preserving the mangroves, which are a huge sink for carbon, one of the best in the world. Those two things happen together and the community is better for it. So we look for projects, that also touch communities and show the power and the promise of clean energy. Barefoot College is another idea… that these women can make a livelihood out of being solar mamas and solar engineers is really powerful.

Lisa Jackson at the Barefoot College in Rajasthan during a 2016 visit. Lisa Jackson at the Barefoot College in Rajasthan during a 2016 visit.

Seeing so much acceleration in terms of climate change, do you think efforts from companies like Apple needs to change pace too?

When we set the 2030 goal, it was sooner than anyone was asking companies to decarbonise and we did that on purpose. We asked what is the most aggressive way we can do it and I like to remind people we couldn’t just set a goal, we had to come up with a roadmap, just like we have a roadmap for every product that Apple eventually releases. There’s a roadmap for years to get to that product.

We have the same kind of roadmap to get to carbon neutral in 2030. So I would say we set an aggressive target knowing the science. And on days when it’s incredibly hot or when we are looking at droughts or when we are looking at wildfires, we know what impact that is having on communities and on health. I am a huge believer that at the end of the day, it is our humanity that will solve this problem that each one of us will have to care for our communities and our families. And we have to do it as fast as we can. We have to make it just as important as if it was our child as if it was our home as if it was our water. And when we do that, then we will all act with the urgency that we should. There’s a reason its global climate change… none of us can be safe if all of us aren’t.",Apple’s Lisa Jackson: Indian govt’s commitment to energy is like a wind at our back

However, a lot has to be done when it comes to the used stock or mobile e-waste.

While Apple scores high on overall longevity, updates, and innovations toward sustainability, Samsung scores higher in repair, energy efficiency and after-sales networks, according to Counterpoint Research.

Production of a smartphone is responsible for about 80 per cent of the total carbon footprint in its life cycle, and hence it is the most vital of the stages.

Top brands like Samsung, Apple, and OPPO have started propagating environmental benefits through their initiatives in production, the report mentioned.

""Due to sustainability efforts, OEMs have to maintain a balance between enticing the consumer and saving the environment. Chinese leaders like OPPO, Xiaomi, and vivo are consistently trying to improve battery life and energy efficiency,"" said Glen Cardoza, senior research analyst.

However, OEMs have a lot to do when it comes to reclaiming their smartphones once their useable life comes to an end.

""Getting pre-owned smartphones back into the system is necessary to handle them sustainably. They need to be repaired/refurbished for reuse or recycled responsibly to complete the circular loop. The main objective here is to reduce e-waste. It is vital to know how much OEMs are doing for this cause,"" Cardoza added.

In 2021, the global refurbished market grew 15 per cent (on-year) and shows promise to grow further in the coming years.

""Carriers and retail refurbishment players are growing but OEM initiatives on reclamation, refurbishment, and e-waste reduction are quite limited. Even the best brands are not active enough in pulling back their used stock,"" the report mentioned.

The highest potential now rests with initiatives like trade-ins, which ensure a buyback of the older devices.

""Brands like OPPO, vivo and Xiaomi have a long way to go with reclaiming and refurbishing devices if we consider the volume of new smartphones shipped by them every year. Apple and Samsung lead here as well but most of the reclaiming and refurbishing is done by the other players in the secondary ecosystem,"" the report said.

Whether you have a tech lover (or 10) on your gift list or you’re working on your own tech-heavy list for someone else who wants to treat you, it’s always a challenge navigating among the many products out there that are yours for the choosing. These Apple experts are here to make your search just a little easier if you’re shopping for Apple products — they say you should never waste your money on these products.

Apple MagSafe Battery Pack

This battery pack is an extremely convenient battery pack for iPhone users since it is portable and charges your device on the go without the need for cables, according to Dylan Kaplan from EnjoyMachineLearning.com. “However, the price is not proportionate to its functionality,” Kaplan pointed out. “Apple’s MagSafe battery pack costs 99$ but only has a 3000mAh capacity. It can only charge an iPhone 12-13 mini up to 70%, iPhone 12-14 pro from 0% to around approximately 60%, and the Pro Max models to around 40% additional charge.”

Instead, Kaplan said, there are better options such as the Anker 622 which has more capacity. “It has 5000mAh which is around 67% more than Apple’s,” Kaplan said. “Further, it has a built-in foldable kickstand that can be used as a stand for better viewing. All of these are for only $59.99, which is obviously lower in cost compared to the Apple MagSafe battery pack.”

Magic Keyboard Folio

The Magic Keyboard Folio, specifically created for the new iPad 10th generation, can only be used by the said model — which is one of its downsides, according to Kaplan. “An extra $249 for the keyboard on top of the $449 cost of the iPad 10th gen is not worth it,” Kaplan said. “There is only a $100 difference between this combo and buying an iPad Pro that has the latest M2 chip that can compete against the current fastest processors in the computer industry.”

Kaplan recommends alternatives such as the Logitech Combo Touch for a lower price point of $199. “It has an additional portion dedicated to Apple Pencil 1 or Logitech Crayon,’ Kaplan said. “Since the iPad 10th gen does not have support for Apple Pencil 2, which is capable of attaching itself to the iPad models compatible with it, the dedicated holder adds up to convenience.”

AppleCare

AppleCare is Apple’s extended warranty program, and it is not worth the money, according to Apple and Tech Expert Ilam Padmanabhan.

“For one thing, Apple products are generally very reliable and don’t break down often,” Padmanabhan said. “And if something does go wrong, it is usually covered by the standard one-year warranty. Additionally, AppleCare is very expensive – it can cost almost as much as the product itself. Finally, many credit cards offer extended warranty coverage for free, so there is no need to pay for it separately.”

Refurbished Products

Padmanabhan believes refurbished products are another waste of money when it comes to Apple products. “These are products that have been returned by customers and then fixed by Apple,” Padmanabhan said. “While they may be cheaper than buying a new product, they are not necessarily a good deal. First of all, you don’t know what kind of problem the product had in the first place.”

Additionally, Padmanabhan added, refurbished products may not come with all of the accessories or features that a new product would have. “And finally, the warranty on a refurbished product is often shorter than the warranty on a new product,” Padmanabhan said. “Buying a new (but a slightly older model) is often a better option.”

Third-Party Accessories

“There are plenty of third-party accessories available for Apple products, but you shouldn’t waste your money on them,” Padmanabhan said. “First of all, Apple products are designed to work best with first-party accessories. Additionally, third-party accessories are often lower quality and may not last as long as first-party accessories. Finally, third-party accessories may void your warranty if something goes wrong with them.”

Non-Apple Chargers

Using a non-Apple charger with your iPhone or iPad is a bad idea for several reasons.

“First of all, non-Apple chargers are not always compatible with Apple devices and can cause damage to them,” Padmanabhan said. “Additionally, non-Apple chargers may not be safe to use – they could overheat or catch fire. Finally, using a non-Apple charger voids your warranty, so you will have to pay for any repairs yourself if something goes wrong.”

Even if it costs a little more, always opt for the Apple charger that is made specifically for your Apple device.

It demonstrates the iPhone maker's ability to steadily roll out new services that expand its product ecosystem, while strengthening customer loyalty. Apple's high-yield savings account is available Monday for users of its Goldman Sachs (GS)-backed credit card. There are no minimum deposit or balance requirements and cash-back rewards generated from Apple Card purchases will automatically be deposited into the savings account, which is also operated in partnership with Goldman. Apple noted the savings account's 4.15% annual interest rate is more than 10-times the national average, citing data compiled by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, as of March 20. The savings account launches three weeks after Apple rolled out its buy now, pay later service , which allows users to pay for purchases in four installments over a six-week period. AAPL 1Y mountain Apple (AAPL) one-year performance. The savings account is unlikely to have a material impact on Apple's profit-and-loss statement — but that's not its fundamental purpose. Like Apple's other financial services — including Apple Pay — the savings account is largely about boosting the long-term attractiveness of owning an iPhone, the crown jewel of its hardware lineup. ""We view Apple's payments and financing offerings as principally being ecosystem enhancing, and relatively immaterial in the context of Apple's overall finances,"" Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi wrote in a note to clients after Apple launched its buy now, pay later service. Bernstein estimates that despite Apple Pay's prominence in everyday life, it generates only $450 million to $700 million in annual revenue for the company — less than 0.2% of total sales. But as users further integrate their personal finances into Apple products, they become more likely to buy another iPhone when it comes time to upgrade their devices. And Apple's base of active devices is an essential part of its increasingly important services revenue stream, which includes money generated by the App Store and Apple Music. The larger that base of active devices, which stood at more than 2 billion in February , the more people who will pay for additional Apple services. While hardware and services work in concert for Apple, investors really focus on the growth of services, which are higher margin and more predictable than lumpy device sales. As a result, investors are willing to pay up for services revenue, which in practice translates into a higher price-to-earnings multiple (P/E) on Apple's stock. Services were nearly 20% of Apple's total revenue in its most-recent fiscal year, which concluded in September. That's up from about 14% in its fiscal 2018. Apple's forward P/E has steadily increased over that time period — trading today at more than 20-times forward earnings, compared with 16-times in September 2018.

And sadly, the answer is: in truth, there is a far bigger issue to be addressed. Here, Gerry McGovern underlines the reality that it is the sheer volume of phones being manufactured that is the real environmental disaster area...

Tech giants Apple, last week, announced what the corporation describes as a major acceleration of its work to expand recycled materials across its products, including a new 2025 target to use 100 percent recycled cobalt in all Apple-designed batteries.

Additionally, by 2025, the statement – issued from Apple’s global HQ in Cupertino, California – promised, ""magnets in Apple devices will use entirely recycled rare earth elements, and all Apple-designed printed circuit boards will use 100 percent recycled tin soldering and 100 percent recycled gold plating.”

The background to these heavily trumpeted targets was explained as follows.

""In 2022, the company significantly expanded its use of key recycled metals, and now sources over two-thirds of all aluminium, nearly three-quarters of all rare earths, and more than 95 percent of all tungsten in Apple products from 100 percent recycled material. This rapid progress brings Apple closer to its aim to one day make all products with only recycled and renewable materials, and advances the company’s 2030 goal to make every product carbon neutral.”

And there was specific reference to cobalt in the statement.

""Apple has significantly expanded the use of 100 percent certified recycled cobalt over the past three years, making it possible to include in all Apple-designed batteries by 2025.”

WHOLLY UNSUSTAINABLE

That all sounds like good news. But it is important for us all to maintain a bit of perspective.

The reality is that there has been an almost 400% increase in cobalt mining since 1970. The vast majority of this cobalt comes from the Copperbelt of Democratic Republic of Congo and Zambia. In the region of 50% of world production of cobalt emanates from the DRC alone, where the conditions under which workers have to operate are beyond appalling. And, equally, where the impact on the local environment is notoriously destructive.

Mining, as is argued in a major piece on Ireland’s mining policy, in the current issue of Hot Press, is a fundamentally dirty business. It inflicts significant damage on the environment. The only question is: how bad can it get? In relation to the production of cobalt, the answer is: very bad indeed.

Advertisement

So what will Apple’s new targets do to change that reality, considering that demand for cobalt is accelerating madly in other areas that are being touted as part of the green agenda – most obviously the introduction of electric cars?

It is estimated that all the cobalt available on land today, anywhere in the world, is less than would be required to help even just the UK to achieve its electric vehicle targets over the next ten years, let alone servicing the demand from the rest of the world. In other words, the demand for the cobalt that’s required for the so-called “green” transition, is going to be wholly unsustainable.

This stark realisation is driving an increasingly aggressive agenda for deep sea mining, at who knows what environmental cost? As a result, you might reasonably conclude, the transition to renewable energy is itself going to be responsible for the renewed devastation of ecosystems on both land and sea.

As John Lennon said, “Strange days indeed. Most peculiar, mama.” But this is where we are, in the spring of 2023.

MONOPOLISTIOC PRACTICES

So, am I excited to hear Apple’s announcement? In fairness, it's a positive that Apple intends to use 100% recycled cobalt. They are, you might say, at least trying.

But it is a small positive, against a backdrop where – in a wider sense – Apple are up to their necks in a game that wreaks social and environmental havoc. Or that’s certainly the way I see it.

The Apple corporation is still part of a system that is geared towards built-in obsolescence – and that is the single biggest problem that we are facing on the planet right now.

They accumulate the vast fortunes that have made them among the Top 3 richest companies in the world, by changing models every season, by making a phone look different, by adding features that can’t be hooked onto to a phone that was sold less than 24 months previously. They profit from the demand they create for new gizmos, even while the older ones are still fully functional. Which makes Apple – and other companies like them – part of the problem rather than authors of a viable solution.

Recycling is positive, but really it should be a last resort. It is 100 times better for the environment to keep products longer in use than to recycle them.

In any event, right now, recycling of smartphones is at an abysmal level. Only 15% of smartphones are recycled – and of those that are, only about 30% of reusable materials can be retrieved from the little boxes, because so many materials are packed into such a small space.

Advertisement

So, the Circular Economy for smartphones is currently running at about 5%. How absurd and shameful is that?

So, I’m afraid that my response to Apple’s announcement is shot through with a deep sense of disquiet.

The inescapable truth, in my view, is that Apple would be doing a lot more for the environment if it embraced material simplicity as a design philosophy and committed to 100% recyclability of all the materials it uses.

Even more important, I believe that Apple must genuinely support the Right To Repair movement, something that up until now it seems to have done everything in its power to thwart. This is something that increasingly affects all areas of tech-based consumer products. Cars, for example, are deliberately designed to make it difficult for anyone other than a designated “main dealer” for the car brand to service, repair, or even change a faulty bulb.

That the regulators in charge of consumer protection have failed to address what are self-evidently monopolistic practices is scandalous. But there is little doubt either that Apple Inc understands what is involved in being “sustainable.""

Genuinely aiming for that holy grail would mean moving away from the Planned Obsolescence model that it – and other corporations like it – have perfected. It would mean designing and supporting phones that last at least 10 years. It would require a whole new mind-set.

Then and only then would Apple be genuinely entitled to claim it is a sustainable company.

Everything else, I’m afraid, is greenwashing.",Are Plans Announced by Apple to Use 100% Recycled Cobalt Worth a Damn?

Two recently published Apple patents, spotted by Gizmodo, describe how the iPhone maker will achieve full body tracking using its existing devices.

One of the patents, filed in 2021, talks about capturing inertial sensor data from a head-mounted device and using it to track the changes in the body posture. For example, detecting all stages when a person sitting on a chair stands up (and vice versa). The patent also talks about tracking a user's head movement with respect to the rest of the body.

The other patent, filed in 2022, enhances full body tracking by fetching data from different wearables like an Apple Watch, AirPods, etc., all worn simultaneously. These devices can be used in combination with compact sensor modules like the inertial sensor, altimeter, and camera placed at different parts of a user's body or clothes to ""create a distributed sensing system.""

The inertial sensor data and point-of-view video data collected can be used to ""reconstruct a full body 2D skeletal model"" and create a ""3D mesh model of the user's full body based on the depth data."" These attributes combined with a machine learning model can predict body movements.

As per the second patent, this kind of body tracking can ""provide detailed insights into a user's movements, allowing improved progress tracking for various fitness activities or health monitoring."" For instance, a workout summary could include stuff like the number of weighted squats and workout trends such as range of motion improvements. The tech has other applications like detecting if a person is sick or has fallen, or apps that can understand full-body sign languages such as the ones used at airport runway signals and by traffic police.

For now, there is no word on when (or if) the patented tech will arrive on the market. One Apple product that could possibly house such features is Apple's long-awaited mixed-reality headset whose delayed launch is now expected in the third quarter of 2023.

However, a Chinese company has recently released a replica that not only boasts a price tag of a mere $35, but also offers a unique twist: a circular design.

A circular Apple Watch Ultra may look something like this

At first glance, the Chinese copy looks a lot like the Apple Watch Ultra, but it is different because it has a round shape. The device is 51.0 x 44.8 x 11.8 millimetres and has a 1.6-inch HD screen with a 454 x 454 pixel resolution. The case has a sporty leather strap that goes around the wrist.

The replica claims to have a heart rate sensor, blood oxygen monitoring, sleep monitoring, sedentary warnings, step tracking, and exercise tracking. This list also includes a blood pressure monitor, which is something that none of the Apple Watches have.

Some of the other benefits are remote control of the camera and music, weather forecasts, reminders for calls and SMS, and more. When you raise your hand, the screen instantly gets brighter.

The battery life of the IP67 rated device is advertised as up to a week in normal mode and 25 days in standby thanks to a 300mAh battery. That should be a goal for the real Apple Watch to reach for!

Looks can be deceiving

While this intriguing knockoff may give us a glimpse of what a circular Apple Watch Ultra could look like, it’s important to remember that appearances can be deceiving.

Essential reading: Top fitness trackers and health gadgets

When it comes to functionality and programme support, the Chinese copy is far behind. The device won’t be able to track health and fitness nearly as well as the Apple Watch Ultra. This makes it more of an interesting design experiment than a real option for people who want a high-quality smartwatch.

There are several reasons for this disparity:

To save money, such companies often use materials and parts of lower quality, which can hurt a device’s durability, reliability, and general user experience. Cloned devices do not have access to the same software, firmware updates, and app ecosystems as their real versions. This makes them much less flexible and useful. Most companies that make cheap copies don’t spend a lot of money on strict quality control methods, which leads to uneven performance and a higher chance of problems. The sensors in these kinds of devices may be way off when it comes to health and exercise tracking. For example, this watch can track your blood pressure, which isn’t something that most watches can do because it’s hard to measure correctly. If a user has problems with their replica gadget, they might not be able to get help, repairs, or a refund, unlike customers of well-known brands like Apple.

So, even though the circle shape of the Chinese copy of the Apple Watch Ultra is an interesting design idea, the device is not nearly as good as the real thing because it doesn’t work as well and isn’t as well made. It is not even in the same ballpark!

When looking at these kinds of goods, consumers should be careful because they often have hidden costs in terms of performance, reliability, and customer service. With these warnings in mind, you can take a closer look at the device on AliExpress. It is available in Black case and strap, along with a silver case orange strap option.

At this point, smart home systems aren't something brand new. Apple competitors such as Amazon's Alexa, Google's Home Assistant, and many others certainly do a pretty good job, but there are certain ways in which HomeKit stands out.

In 2014, Apple officially introduced HomeKit as a software framework that allows users to control smart home devices using their iPhone or iPad. Since then, HomeKit has expanded to support over 1,000 devices from over 100 manufacturers and has become an essential component of Apple's overall strategy to dominate the smart home market. This article will shed some light on HomeKit's usability and the hurdles that it currently faces.

Apple HomeKit's potential and challenges

The great potential of HomeKit

One of HomeKit's key advantages is its ability to provide a unified user experience across a wide range of devices. Users can control everything from their lights and thermostats to their door locks and security cameras using HomeKit, all from the convenience of a single app.

This makes managing smart home devices much easier for users as it uses the Siri voice assistant, which reduces the friction that generally arises when dealing with multiple proprietary apps.

Another advantage of HomeKit is its heavy focus on security and privacy. Apple is well-known for having stringent security standards, and HomeKit is no different. Additionally, it even syncs the settings to the Apple iCloud.

With end-to-end encryption being used by HomeKit to protect users' data, every device must have a unique certificate to ensure that they are genuine. Furthermore, before any device can access or control their home, users must explicitly grant permission to HomeKit.

The challenges faced by HomeKit

Despite its promise, HomeKit faces a number of obstacles that could stifle its growth in the smart home market. One of the most difficult challenges is the lack of compatibility with non-Apple devices.

Currently, HomeKit requires manufacturers to include a special HomeKit chip in their devices, which subsequently increases manufacturing costs and general complexity. As a result, various smart home device manufacturers have chosen to use other software frameworks, such as Amazon's Alexa or Google's Assistant, which boast greater device compatibility.

As such, there's a lack of support for certain popular smart home devices, such as the Nest Thermostat and the Ring doorbell. Considering that these devices are owned by Google and Amazon, respectively, this means that they're unlikely to ever support HomeKit. This can be frustrating for users who want to use these devices alongside their other HomeKit-enabled devices.

Finally, the user interface of HomeKit has been criticized for being rather clunky and difficult to use. While the company has made significant efforts in recent years to improve the interface, some users still find it less intuitive than other smart home apps.

HomeKit certainly has the potential to be a major player in the smart home ecosystem, and in some contexts, it definitely is. It offers a unified and secure user experience across a wide range of devices. Device compatibility with HomeKit might be an issue for those who want to use different types of devices in their smart home, but there's no real competition in the market when it comes to security features.

As every brand provides a different user experience, consumers might side with one more than the other. Issues such as this can easily be fixed with software changes, but at the end of the day, it all comes down to the users' individual preferences.

When it comes to a holistic tech ecosystem, few do it quite like Apple. Sure, you could just use a MacBook, or an iPhone, and have it work fine. You might especially like the Apple Watch, or find an iPad easiest to get along with.

But when you combine them, the real magic happens. All of the devices feed off one another, and some intelligent features make it effortless to complete everyday tasks across devices. Put simply, it just works.

One of the cornerstones of Apple's ecosystem is AirDrop. It works as a sharing platform between devices, allowing you to select a file on one device and 'drop' it onto another.

In practice, it's really useful. Take a file from your emails on your laptop and save it on your phone for easy access. Or sign a document on your tablet, then send it onto your laptop to return it.

The popularity of AirDrop clearly hasn't gone unnoticed. A couple of years ago, Google unveiled Nearby Share – its own take on the concept. Initially, it worked with Chromebooks. Then, Android phones also got the ability. Now, a beta version of Nearby Share for Windows is live, allowing users to share between their Android devices and traditional Windows-based PCs.

In principal, this allows the same functionality that users in the Apple ecosystem get. Simply select a photo, video, or other file on one device, hit share and select the nearby share option. You'll then be greeted with a host of applicable nearby devices which you can pass the file onto.

It's a brilliant feature for those who want to use a non-Apple ecosystem. I personally use AirDrop every day, and its impact on how smooth simple day-to-day tasks are is immeasurable. Getting that functionality on Android and Windows should be seen for what it is – an absolutely stellar upgrade, which makes the whole package much more appealing.",Nearby Share brings one of Apple's best features to Android and Windows

The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) is the president's main advisor on telecommunications and Internet policy. In April last year, the NTIA announced that it had launched an investigation into competition in mobile app ecosystems. The investigation was triggered by an executive order on Promoting Competition in the American Economy from July 2021, with the aim of making recommendations for improving competition, reducing barriers to entry, and maximizing user benefit.

Months after its contents were shared with the White House, the NTIA this week published the ""Competition in the Mobile Application Ecosystem"" report – the first such report into Apple's ecosystem by a federal organization. On the basis of the investigation's findings, the report recommends:



Third-party app stores should be permitted and users should not be prevented from sideloading apps outside a gatekeeper's own app store. Legislative and regulatory measures should prohibit restrictions on sideloading, alternative app stores, and web apps.

Requirements that ban developers from using alternative in-app payment systems should be banned.

Third-party web browser apps should be able to offer full functionality and not face browser engine restrictions.

Pre-installed apps, default options, and anticompetitive self-preferencing should be limited, including in search results.

Users should be able to choose their own apps as defaults and delete or hide pre-installed apps.

And it’s only getting better.

Not simply that, but it’s an ecosystem that’s independent of Google. Though it has distinct ties to the company, it can survive without buying a single piece of Google hardware — and that is where its value ultimately lies.

Why Apple’s ecosystem lock-in is so good

The Apple ecosystem needs no introduction for anyone even tangentially connected to tech. It’s the term given for the synergy that one can get when purchasing all Apple products. That synergy grows exponentially; the more people have Apple products, the more useful the ecosystem gets.

Take something like iMessage or AirDrop. It’s good and laudable that it can work with all your devices seamlessly, but they are no good if they can’t interface with those of your friends. As a result of the sheer popularity of Apple’s devices in the western world, Apple’s ecosystem has turned into a self-perpetuating machine, and it’s something that other companies would love to emulate for that very reason.

The more people have Apple products, the more useful the ecosystem gets.

“#MadeByGoogle” is Google’s own attempt to mimic the Apple ecosystem. There, if you equip yourself with a bevy of Google products, you’ll be able to have a similar experience as with Apple products. Your Pixel Buds follow you from Pixel phone to Pixel phone, you can access your phone’s photos on a PixelBook with a click, your Nest Mini can form the center of your home, while your Pixel Tablet and Pixel Watch round out the slate.

I’ve criticized Google’s ecosystem before for being an inconsistent one, and the same still holds true in 2023. The Pixel Tablet is yet to materialize, who knows when the Pixel Watch would be updated, and there’s no Pixelbook 3 because Google is done with laptops this year.

Google isn’t the only company to attempt to imitate the Apple ecosystem. Microsoft has its Surface devices as well as a toe in the mobile market with the Surface Duo. Might a Surface Solo or Surface Fold be forthcoming? The folks at Windows Central certainly think so. Samsung has tried to imitate Apple’s ecosystem, but the varying ecosystems (none of which it directly controls) don’t quite mesh together as cohesively. As an Android, Windows, and ChromeOS manufacturer, it is beholden to both Google and Microsoft to push its ambitions. Is that a good idea? Huawei would say, probably not.

Google has a big advantage Apple can’t replicate

On the other hand, Google’s failings have created a powerful ecosystem that supersedes Apple’s in one way — it’s widely available. Android is one of the most widely used software platforms on the planet. Certainly, Apple has an advantage in some countries, but on a larger scale, Android is more widely used. Google has also done a lot of work in making sure that some of the touted Apple ecosystem features are available on all platforms that allow it.

Google’s failings have created a powerful ecosystem that supersedes Apple’s in one way — it’s widely available.

This means that not just Chromebook users, but Windows 11 users can try out quite a few integration features through Microsoft’s Your Phone Companion feature. For more specific features like App Streaming, there are certain limitations, and then it breaks down to more brand-specific tools. But broader features — sending files across devices, universal clipboards, messaging across platforms, and so on — all work.

Of course, Google fails at driving the engagement that makes Apple equivalent features useful. Whether due to poor branding — like with RCS and Nearby Share — uneven feature rollouts, or a lack of confidence in Google supporting its own services for an extended period. The company has built a powerful ecosystem, but it’s been handicapped by factors outside its control.

There’s a tendency in tech to consider things that Apple does as the best way and an ideal to slavishly strive for. Of course, there’s no denying that Apple is incredibly successful and that there is wisdom in following the well-beaten path. However, Apple’s ecosystem approach places an undue amount of trust not only in the company but that all the individual cogs that make up the ecosystem will work well and will continue to do so in the future.

If you’re not a fan of the iPhone 14 Pro Max because its cameras don’t agree with you, to throw a random example out there, you’re kind of stuck. At the same time, putting all your tech eggs in one basket rather than spread out carries its own risks — as anyone following Twitter will agree. It’s true that Google wants to have an ecosystem like Apple. The cool thing about Google’s multi-pronged approach, though, is that we don’t necessarily have to care.

Leading up to it I had been bombarded with photos and videos of girls my age with their iPhones and MacBooks slathered in filters and cool stickers. I wanted so badly to take part in that, and finally, understand what the hype was all about.

Now I’m all grown up and I’ve had my hands on almost every kind of Apple product the average person would come into contact with. I got through university thanks to an iPad Air, and now with my job, I’ve used MacBooks and Mac minis and I’ve just recently got my hands on an Apple Watch. Safe to say I have used most of the products aimed at the everyday consumer and I must say, the Apple ecosystem is seamless. Not perfect, but incredibly close.

With all these products now part of my everyday life, I’ve noticed they kind of … cancel each other out. I know most people wouldn't actually have this much stuff (I am very lucky my job gives me access to so many fruit-themed gadgets) but it does give me a pretty interesting insight into how one product makes the other one obsolete. If I’ve got a tablet and a phone, I don’t need a MacBook unless something in my life demands it. I can just get a keyboard and a mouse and save a lot of money . If I’ve got a MacBook and an iPhone, I don’t need a Mac Mini. I’ve been thinking about how much we spend on so many products that are not very useful to us in a real-world sense.

Do they all have to talk to each other?

My iPad was my baby for about three and a bit years. I did assignments, job interviews, presentations and project designs on the handy little tablet. It was also my television for most of my university life. And with just the iPad as the only other device besides my iPhone, the ecosystem was useful in that it skipped over all the annoying set-up bits of the iPad and I could always hop between my phone and my tablet whenever I needed to without much fuss.

One by one, as I added more Apple devices to my collection, the more convoluted things got for me. It can be a lot to keep up with, particularly if you have work or school devices and then your own personal ones. Keeping up with which device has what setting, which Focus Mode every device is in, and the incredibly annoying moment when you get a Facetime Call and everything in your house starts screaming can quickly end up being a bit of a nightmare.

I know, it's a first-world problem I’m describing here. Again, I only own two of the devices I’m talking about here. It got me thinking though; you don’t need a lot to get the most out of the Apple ecosystem. The more you add to the web of devices the more settings you have to regulate, the more screens light up when you get a call, and the more passwords you need to remember.

Sometimes it's all a bit much

If you’ve got a work or school device you’re getting personal and professional emails on both sides, Slack or BlackBoard messages and then texts from your mates constantly popping up. Even when you put your devices into do not disturb mode you’ve got a load of places now to go to and comb through notifications. Often when I go from my phone to my iPad I’ll have 60+ unread emails on the iPad to delete even though I’ve read them all on my phone ages ago. Plus it can become very overwhelming to be bombarded

Getting to the point where everything around you has that iconic apple engraved on the back of it is an incredibly expensive journey, so I’m definitely not recommending burying all your money into that. In fact, I am encouraging the exact opposite. I kind of want to start plucking Apple devices out of my life.

The point I’m making is this: less is more. We live in an ever-overflowing consumerist society where every day there is a new product that will seemingly change your life. We buy and buy and buy and end up with a whole lot of stuff we don’t need and end up throwing away or hoarding in our homes because ‘it’ll be useful someday’ and fill landfills in third world countries with e-waste. Every time a new tech trend comes around or a device becomes a status symbol of some kind - think MacBooks and the popularity of AirPod Max headphones among young people for being ‘aesthetic - we’re encouraging each other to buy things we don’t need and spend money a lot of us don’t have. The Apple ecosystem works great, but you don’t need a dozen different devices to experience that.

Abbott also reveals league in no rush to grow beyond 30 franchises

Major League Soccer’s (MLS) new broadcast partnership with Apple will be “transformational” for the competition and enable it to be incorporated into the technology giant’s wider ecosystem.

The US soccer league’s deal with Apple, which was revealed in June, kicks in next season and runs until the end of 2032. As part of the agreement, reportedly worth US$250 million per year, every match will be offered through a new, MLS-dedicated subscription streaming service available exclusively through the Apple TV app.

At the time of the announcement, the league’s commissioner Don Garber believed the partnership would provide the catalyst for further growth, describing it as “a bit of the icing on the cake”.

Now, MLS president and deputy commissioner Mark Abbott has shone further light on the ambitions plans for the tie-up.

“We recognised with the advent of streaming and how that market’s changing, that there was going to be a demand for someone like Apple,” said Abbott, who was speaking at the Leaders Week sport business conference.

“We’re fortunate that they wanted to do [the broadcast partnership], to want to have all the games without territorial restriction.

“I think that the deal with Apple is transformational for the league without question, but also transformational for our industry. When we think about the global reach of Apple, to be able to partner with the most innovative [and] successful company in the world, there could be no better partnership for us.

“There’s so many aspects that are exciting about it. Among the most, is the ability to incorporate MLS throughout the Apple ecosystem.

“Just look at what happened when Apple got into music and how it transformed that business. Now it’s going to happen that they’re into sports.”

Abbott, who is stepping down from his position at the end of the 2022 season after nearly 30 years with MLS, also gave an update on the league’s franchise expansion plans. He confirmed the league was focusing on bringing a new club to Las Vegas, reaffirming comments from Garber last December that the city was the favourite to secure a 30th franchise slot.

Among those interested are Wes Edens and Nassef Sawiris, the co-owners of Premier League side Aston Villa, with the Las Vegas Review Journal (LVRJ) reporting in January that the pair had entered exclusive talks.

While Abbott did not reveal a specific timeframe for a Vegas franchise, he did state that MLS currently has no firm plans to grow beyond 30 teams, even though he feels the US is comfortably big enough to accommodate additional clubs. He added that interest from potential new franchise owners is high and sounded out San Diego as a “really dynamic market”.

The league, though, will not be rushed into making a decision.

“We want to be strategic about that,” Abbott said. “We’ve always been strategic in the way we grow. But we’re getting towards the end of our growth plans.”",MLS will tap Apple ecosystem to turbocharge growth

More and more smartphone OEMs are adopting the circular approach. Apple and Samsung stand out as leaders in sustainable initiatives.

Each of the top OEMs performs differently across the three major stages of the smartphone circular economy – production, usage and end of life.

OEM tie-ups with local sustainability partners have increased, leading to circular initiatives across geographies. But OEM initiatives fall short when compared to the volumes of new smartphones being shipped every year.

London, Jakarta, Hong Kong, Boston, Toronto, New Delhi, Beijing, Taipei, Seoul – December 27, 2022

Apple leads the smartphone space in the overall approach towards sustainability, according to Counterpoint Research’s latest “Smartphones and Circular Economy: Creating a Sustainable Future” report. This report assesses how well the OEM is reducing its impact on the environment by reusing materials, recycling devices, and minimizing waste at each stage, from the design of the smartphone, processing chips, and packaging to power consumption. The report also encompasses corporate-level initiatives, progress on carbon neutrality, and SDG 13 (one of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals adopted by the United Nations).

The Smartphone Circular Economy Report Scorecard includes a robust metric system that evaluates the top five smartphone OEMs globally. Each OEM has its own vision and overall approach toward sustainability. Apple’s vision seems to be clearer than its competition and its actions support the said vision.

Apple on Top in Sustainability Vision Rankings Compared to Immediate Competition

While sustainability vision is just the start, each of these OEMs has performed quite differently across the three major stages of the smartphone circular economy:

Production

Usage

End of Life

Production

Production of a smartphone is responsible for about 80% of the total carbon footprint in its life cycle, and hence it is the most vital of the stages. OEMs have concentrated on and advertised this aspect the most. Newly sourced materials are being replaced with eco-friendly components, while biodegradable and eco-friendly packaging is the norm now. Even water-saving mechanisms are being adhered to in the entire manufacturing ecosystem. OEMs are now expecting their vendors to adhere to environmental norms as well. Top brands like Samsung, Apple, and OPPO have started propagating environmental benefits through their initiatives in production. The details, however, are more complex than what is being advertised. While the initiatives are a big step in the right direction, revenue and profit remain the apex objectives.

Usage

Most consumer durable brands inherently work towards motivating consumers to replace their devices with newer, more technologically enhanced versions. But due to sustainability efforts, OEMs have to maintain a balance between enticing the consumer and saving the environment. Chinese leaders like OPPO, Xiaomi, and, vivo are consistently trying to improve battery life and energy efficiency.

While Apple scores high on overall longevity, updates, and innovations toward sustainability, Samsung scores higher in repair, energy efficiency and after-sales networks. In the end, it depends on how long a consumer chooses to use a device. Any steps taken by OEMs to support this endeavor matter most.

End of Life

OEMs have a lot to do when it comes to reclaiming their smartphones once their useable life comes to an end. Getting pre-owned smartphones back into the system is necessary to handle them sustainably. They need to be repaired/refurbished for reuse or recycled responsibly to complete the circular loop. The main objective here is to reduce e-waste. It is vital to know how much OEMs are doing for this cause.

The global refurbished market has grown by leaps and bounds in the last few years. In 2021, the market grew 15% YoY and shows promise to grow further in the coming years. Carriers and retail refurbishment players are growing but OEM initiatives on reclamation, refurbishment, and e-waste reduction are quite limited. Even the best brands are not active enough in pulling back their used stock. The highest potential now rests with initiatives like trade-ins, which ensure a buyback of the older devices. This takes volumes of landfills. Brands like OPPO, vivo and Xiaomi have a long way to go with reclaiming and refurbishing devices if we consider the volume of new smartphones shipped by them every year. Apple and Samsung lead here as well but most of the reclaiming and refurbishing is done by the other players in the secondary ecosystem. The end-of-life stage is quite complex but one of the most rewarding if done right.

OEM tie-ups with local sustainability partners have increased, leading to circular initiatives across geographies. But such initiatives need to grow at a faster rate to be in consonant with the volumes of new smartphones being shipped every year. There are opportunities as well. Sustainability and its different aspects, initiatives and players can be broken down into many sectors with varying opportunities. The benefits for the environment compound when the industry and government take steps in the right direction.

OEMs already have a name for themselves, but their sustainability initiatives will either make or break their perception in the years to come.

But new Macs, iPads, and iPhones might not be the star of 2023. Instead, a new report suggests Apple is readying an entirely new ecosystem.

According to Bloomberg, Apple is “ramping up work on a mixed-reality headset” that is due to finally launch in the new year. Along with the hardware, which has managed to avoid major leaks so far, Apple is working on a new dedicated operating system called xrOS, as well as an xrOS App Store for third-party software. Like iOS and macOS, the new name suggests the platform is a major component of the headset.

Bloomberg had previously reported that Apple’s OS was being developed under the realityOS name, but the new xrOS branding suggests Apple has bigger plans for the ecosystem. Bloomberg notes that “xr” stands for extended reality, which encompasses both virtual and augmented reality devices and applications. Like iOS and macOS, xrOS will likely constitute a full platform of devices with features that complement each other and Apple’s other devices.

One of the xrOS devices will surely be a headset—or possibly two if Apple continues to separate its products into Pro and non-Pro models—but another could be something a little smaller and even more personal. In a patent filing with the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office, Apple has described a “Self-Mixing Interferometry-Based Input Device” or an Apple Ring. As spotted by Patently Apple, Apple describes the system as an “SMI-based gesture input system including at least one of a wearable device or a handheld device.”

Such a system would obviously work extremely well in conjunction with a headset. Apple also shows the Ring working with an Apple Pencil for AR applications. An Apple Ring would also presumably have health features that work independently from a headset as well, similar to the Oura Smart Ring that tracks sleep, readiness, and activity.

Work on Apple’s mixed-reality “metaverse” has been steadily ramping up, with rumors pointing to a 2023 launch. The headset will reportedly feature a pair of 8K displays and an M1 processor, and come with a hefty price tag. But if the rumors of a new platform and ecosystem are true, the price and the wait will be worth the investment.",Apple is reportedly developing xrOS to power the next ecosystem of devices

Bayer makes substantial progress in accelerating development of biologicals through collaborations with Ginkgo Bioworks, Kimitec and M2i

Innovative varieties of fruits and vegetables can help develop more sustainable and regenerative food systems and increase access to essential nutrients

BERLIN, GERMANY / ACCESSWIRE / March 23, 2023 / - At this year's Fruit Logistica taking place in Berlin from February 8-10 Bayer highlights its solutions towards regenerative agriculture (Bayer booth: hall 1.2, stand C23), meaning the balance between productivity outcomes and environmental protection, while supporting the needs of society and farmers. Key to regenerative agriculture is partnering with players along the whole food chain. ""The pressure on food systems is rising each year. To nutritiously feed a growing world population while protecting the planet's boundaries, we need to produce more food with less resources and develop solutions that can cope with climate change,"" said Inci Dannenberg, President of Global Vegetable Seeds at Bayer's Crop Science Division. ""The challenges are so big and multi-faceted that they can only be addressed if we join forces.""

Biologicals innovation with tremendous environmental and business potential

One pillar in that collaborative approach towards regenerative agriculture is Bayer's advancement in Biologicals, in other words agricultural inputs that are derived from biological instead of synthetic processing. The company has recently entered multiple promising collaborations in that space which will be showcased at Bayer's booth at Fruit Logistica.

Bayer just lately entered a strategic partnership with Spanish biologicals company Kimitec focusing on accelerating the development and commercialization of biological crop protection products, as well as biostimulants to promote plant growth. Bayer also entered a partnership with French company M2i Group to supply fruit and vegetable growers around the world with pheromone-based biological crop protection products. In 2022, Ginkgo Bioworks became a multi-year strategic partner with Bayer to develop biological solutions in areas such as nitrogen optimization, carbon sequestration, and next generation crop protection.

Story continues

Driving the development of biologicals is promising as it addresses environmental and business potential likewise. While it reduces the impact on the environment the biologicals market is expected to grow to nearly €25 billion by 2028.1

Advancing sustainability and access to essential nutrients through seed innovation and food chain partnerships

The world is not only facing food insecurity, the need for a more sustainable and regenerative food system, and climate issues but also a nutrition gap. Bayer, through its Vegetables by Bayer business along with its Seminis® and De Ruiter® brands, has been developing various innovative solutions to address these challenges. Examples that are highlighted at Fruit Logistica include Strabena tomato with excellent attachment to vine and improved shelf life reducing the need for plastic packaging, Orange Candy® melon with good field holding and longer shelf life helping to reduce losses, or the Huntington sweet pepper which is a climate resilient variety. Bayer will also present its comprehensive offering to fight the tomato virus (ToBRFV), one of the biggest challenges for growers. This includes the De Ruiter® varieties with Intermediate Resistance2 to ToBRFV, such as Strabini, already growing commercially in many glasshouses and the two new varieties Ferreira and Novero recently launched in North America and Mexico.

To enable access to essential vitamins and minerals, particularly in underserved communities, Bayer, through The Nutrient Gap Initiative, also engages in direct intervention, education and advocacy. Originally an initiative by Bayer's Consumer Health division, Bayer's Crop Science division will also be part of it from 2023 onwards adding the importance of access to essential nutrients from fruits and vegetables.

Another example of how Bayer is contributing to food security and nutrition supply through engaging with partners along the food value chain is the company's effort to curb the spread of Tropical Race 4 (TR4). This disease threats the existence of the banana as it is known. It causes a lethal wilt in banana plants and an infested plantation will lose its entire production for that year, and potentially several years more. Bayer has engaged with the Global Alliance Against TR4 and, through a module of its BayG.A.P. program, has trained hundreds of banana farmers on prevention against TR4. BayG.A.P. is a service program which supports and educates farmers worldwide to get certified and connected to the food value chain.

New water strategy

This week, at the UN 2023 Water Conference in New York, Bayer launched its new water strategy — pledging to making water an integral part of its business decisions, investments and selection of suppliers. Bayer's water strategy reflects its position as a key player in the fields of health and agriculture and aims to have an impact that goes beyond the company's own business.

“The world is facing a severe water crisis affecting ecosystems, food security and human health,” explains Bayer CEO Werner Baumann. “As a leader in health and nutrition, we have an intrinsic motivation to address the water crisis and make a valuable contribution. With our global footprint and strong supplier engagements, Bayer will create value and encourage sector-wide action. Our ambition is to play a leading role in promoting corporate water stewardship and rallying other businesses to take action to protect the world’s water resources.”

Bayer’s commitments will encompass the entire value chain, from its own operations to the farmers Bayer serves. Key elements of the water strategy are:

Resilient agriculture: On average, 70 percent of global freshwater withdrawals are in agriculture. Bayer commits to improving water productivity in water-scarce regional cropping systems, starting with rice — which is responsible for up to 43 percent of the world’s irrigation water withdrawals. The company is committed to improving water use per kilogram of crop by 25 percent by 2030, by transforming rice-cropping systems for smallholder customers in the relevant regions where Bayer operates. Bayer’s existing commitment of reducing the environmental impact of its crop-protection portfolio by 30 percent by 2030 also contributes to water quality.

Content creators for good Join us as we explore a brand guide to collaborating with influencers and their audiences, as well as the role of content creators as brands themselves in the behavior-change movement, at Brand-Led Culture Change — May 22-24 in Minneapolis. Tell me more! Business and investment: Bayer is developing a concept to integrate water quality and quantity into business decisions and processes that will be rolled out from 2024 onwards. The company will develop a methodology to quantify the value of water and incorporate it into investment processes. In 2021, water and wastewater matters represented roughly 10 percent of Bayer’s total CapEx projects.

Suppliers and growers: Bayer evaluates the sustainability performance of all key suppliers and of selected high-sustainability-risk suppliers using a sustainability-risk classification that includes water. The company has launched a new Supplier Code of Conduct, with dedicated items to address water and wastewater. At the same time, Bayer will continue to drive improvements in water-use efficiency with growers across seed production.

Sites and facilities: Bayer is committed to providing safe drinking water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) to all employees at its sites; and it continues to minimize emissions at its sites worldwide, including emissions into wastewater. Beyond that, Bayer has established strict voluntary-discharge limits for active ingredients into wastewater at all sites where they are produced. Bayer will build upon the existing water-management systems to optimize the use of water at relevant sites in water-scarce areas and extend them to sites that are forecasted to be in water-scarce regions by 2030. Bayer will set context-relevant water targets for its own operations by 2025 that are to be achieved by 2030.

Ambassador and partnerships: Addressing the water crisis will require broad-based, joint action from a myriad of stakeholders. Bayer is well connected in the water space via its involvement in the World Meteorological Organization for Water and Climate Leaders, its active participation in the Water Resilience Coalition, and its partnership with Australian businesswoman and renowned water advocate Mina Guli; as well as with the International Drought Resilience Alliance — an initiative launched during COP27. Bayer will leverage these strong partnerships to assemble and connect the right leaders and ensure appropriate private sector engagement in the upcoming water debate.

“Until now, the topic of water has been overlooked in the climate debate despite the many interlinkages, but with the UN 2023 Water Conference it is gaining momentum,” says Cristina Alonso Alija, Head of Sustainability, Safety, Health & Environment, and responsible for the water strategy at Bayer. “There are new opportunities to take the right sustainable actions, and we must seize these opportunities now. This is why we make water an integral part of our business and investment decisions across the entire value chain. With these decisions, we will contribute to climate resilience and to more sustainable water usage.”

New Harris Poll study

More than two billion people lack access to safe water around the world. This includes in the US, which has its share of regionalized water-related issues. A new study from The Harris Poll, commissioned by Bayer, confirms people in the US recognize the myriad concerns associated with water, including inequitable access, safety and combatting drought. In fact, nearly two in three (61 percent) are concerned about “ensuring everyone has their fair share of clean water”; while more than half are concerned about the safety of their local water supply (54 percent) and ensuring they personally have access to clean water (57 percent). Across the board, Hispanic and Black Americans are more likely to be concerned about water issues than their white counterparts.

“The water crisis is happening right now, everywhere on our planet — and we are still not doing enough to fight it,” said Matthias Berninger, EVP of Public Affairs at Bayer US. “The concrete, scalable solutions we need to combat the crisis are within our reach; but I believe to get us there, we need more commitment from the private sector, more wide-ranging cooperation, and overarching political action. Our vision of ‘Health for All, Hunger for None’ mandates we do our part to make water accessible, clean and abundant.”

Run Blue campaign

In support of expanding education on the global water crisis, Bayer US is the lead sponsor of Mina Guli’s Run Blue campaign. Guli ran 200 marathons in a year (March 2022 – March 2023) and engaged with local stakeholders along the route to raise awareness around water issues and inspire action. Guli completed her 200th marathon at the United Nations in New York on March 21st, just prior to World Water Day.

“The world still turns a blind eye to our worsening water crisis, even though its effects are very real. I’ve seen how drought, dried-up lakes, a lack of access to water or extreme events like floods shape people’s lives across the globe and in the US. Addressing the water crisis requires real action from everyone, including businesses,” Guli said. “That’s why it’s so impactful for a company like Bayer to make water a priority in its operations, supply chain and innovations.”

Bayer has joined the fight to combat the water crisis by developing innovative solutions for one of the most water-intensive sectors. Some current solutions include:

Advanced breeding — with between 34-43 percent of the world’s irrigation water going to irrigated rice, finding solutions that boost the water efficiency of rice cultivation are critical. Bayer plant scientists continue to pursue modern breeding methods to develop locally adapted hybrids that have higher flooding and drought tolerance.

Irrigation technologies — with irrigation accounting for the lion’s share of agriculture’s water consumption, precision agriculture contributes to significant water savings as well as optimization of energy, labor and use of inputs such as crop protection and fertilizers. Bayer is partnering with irrigation pioneers including Netafim and BGN Tech to develop and promote automated irrigation systems that use up to 60 percent less water, and significantly less energy, than conventional irrigation.

Conservation tillage systems — the adoption of adapted tillage techniques (such as strip-till and no-till) reduces run-off, increases infiltration rates and decreases the evaporation of water in the soil, contributing to improved soil moisture and better soil quality, and ultimately, less water needed for irrigation.

“Water is everybody’s business,” Berninger adds. “It’s up to businesses across all sectors to voluntarily reduce the water footprint of their own activities, invest in innovations that help their customers to become increasingly water-smart, scrutinize their supply chains for planet-conscious water management, and incorporate water use in their investment decisions.”

Expanded Nutrient Gap Initiative

On the food side, as a part of the company’s vision “Health for all, Hunger for None,” Bayer recently expanded its Nutrient Gap Initiative (NGI) to now improve access to both nutritious food and safety net supplementation. The program initially aimed to expand access to essential vitamins and minerals to 50 million people in underserved communities by 2030, with a focus on nutritional supplementation — a critical tool to build a safety net for malnutrition in these communities. On the initiative’s second anniversary, the company is evolving the program to also help close the nutrient gap through the most fundamental source: food — namely fruits, vegetables and grains.

Often called “hidden hunger,” vitamin and mineral deficiencies are highly prevalent in underserved communities, with women and children being most vulnerable. This type of malnutrition develops gradually over time — the impact not seen until irreversible damage is done. Deprivation of essential vitamins and minerals can cause poor immunity, birth defects, reduced work capacity, learning disabilities, fragile health or failure to thrive — often exacerbating the cycle of poverty.

“As a global leader in both agriculture and nutritional supplements, Bayer is uniquely positioned to help all people get access to proper nutrition. The roots of malnutrition are complex and far from one-size-fits-all, so we’re drawing on competencies from across our company to fight it. We want to remove the barriers to a healthy diet for those who need it most,” said Heiko Schipper, President of the Consumer Health Division of Bayer AG and Member of the Board of Management.

With the NGI, Bayer aims to consolidate the company’s commitment to food security by addressing both the quantity of food needed to tackle world hunger, as well as the quality needed to ensure healthy lives, with access to essential vitamins and minerals. Malnutrition disproportionately affects vulnerable groups — in particular, women and girls and rural communities — which has clear overlap with the work the company is already doing to improve the livelihoods of smallholder farmers.

Smallholder farmers are the backbone of many food systems, but their communities often suffer from malnutrition and lack health services. Building on the existing strong infrastructure of Better Life Farming — an initiative founded by Bayer, the International Finance Corporation and Netafim — smallholder farmers will become a key audience for The Nutrient Gap Initiative. The Better Life Farming Centers, predominantly in Asia Pacific, provide smallholders in remote rural regions access to essential agricultural products — a key pillar of Bayer’s Smallholder Initiative, which aims to benefit 100 million smallholders in low-and-middle-income countries by 2030. Bayer will pilot the expansion of services offered with access to nutritional solutions and education given that food security cannot be achieved without health equity.

“For people in underserved communities, access to nutritious food is a challenge due to the cost and local availability of fresh produce and grains. As part of our critical work for food security and smallholder farmers, The Nutrient Gap Initiative will help improve the livelihoods of people who do not have access to vitamins and minerals, leveraging also our Better Life Farming Centers,” said Rodrigo Santos, President of the Crop Science Division of Bayer AG and Member of the Board of Management.

Through direct action and in partnership with critical non-governmental organizations and the public sector, the Nutrient Gap Initiative will help close the nutrient gap by addressing the three main barriers to accessing essential vitamins and minerals:

Intervention: The NGI aims to bring nutritious food (produce and grains) and supplementation (i.e. essential vitamins and minerals from the World Health Organization Essential Medicines List) within physical and financial reach of underserved communities. Education: Many vulnerable populations lack knowledge about proper nutrition, how to integrate vitamins and minerals into diets, and the value of supplementation when needed. Through both direct education and work with healthcare providers and farmers, the NGI will disseminate the information they need to take their health into their own hands. Advocacy: Governments and policymakers can have large-scale impact when they prioritize access to affordable and nutritious food, health literacy and make essential supplementation a standard of care. Bayer will collaborate to create an ecosystem to advocate for access to good nutrition.

In 2022, Bayer says the Nutrient Gap Initiative impacted more than 19 million people in underserved communities — accelerating its goal to expand access to everyday health for 100 million people in underserved communities. As the program this year evolves to expand access to nutritious food in addition to supplementation, some of the programs Bayer will be implementing include:","Bayer Pledges to Help Tackle Global Water Crisis, End Malnutrition"

FRANKFURT, Feb 27 (Reuters) - Bayer (BAYGn.DE) has appointed Jeff Ubben to the drugmaker's independent sustainability council, in a sign that the activist investor will be given a say at the embattled group.

The Germany company said in a statement on Monday that Ubben would be one of three new entrants to the nine-member council, which meets with members of Bayer's management board twice a year.

Bayer's shares have been weighed down by litigation over its Roundup weedkiller and by its diversified structure, drawing investors' criticism.

On Feb. 8, Bayer said it would replace its CEO early after a selection process that began in mid-2022, recruiting the former head of Roche's (ROG.S) pharmaceuticals business, Bill Anderson.

Days before the announcement on the CEO changeover, sources told Reuters that Ubben, who runs investment fund Inclusive Capital, had contacted fellow investors to drum up support for big changes at Bayer, including the swift replacement of outgoing CEO Werner Baumann.

Ubben, who holds a 0.83% stake in Bayer, said he was excited about the company’s research and development strengths.

""Bayer’s Crop Science division holds great potential to minimise the need for further deforestation by increasing the current arable land’s productivity,"" Ubben said in Bayer's statement.

A source familiar with the matter has told Reuters that Ubben welcomed Anderson as Bayer's choice of new CEO.

While it was not clear whether Ubben would also seek a supervisory board seat, he was quoted by the Financial Times on Sunday as saying that such a move and the sustainability role USwere not “mutually exclusive”.

A Bayer spokesperson declined to comment further. Ubben could not be immediately reached outside of U.S. business hours.

The other two new members of the sustainability council are former Rwandan health minister Agnes Binagwaho and Dante Pesce, the former chair of the United Nations working group on business and human rights.

Summary

In September 2015, the United Nations (UN) adopted “Agenda 2030,” setting a total of 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). to generate solutions to overcome global challenges such as poverty, hunger, health care, gender equality, climate change and numerous others.

Following our vision Health for All, Hunger for None, we are working on meeting challenges like climate change, food security, environmental impact reduction, and our main objectives - biodiversity and nature preservation – this is the lens through which we prioritize and identify stakeholders across our value chain.

How we inform our strategy

Bayer is a member of several multi-stakeholder platforms to develop collaborative new solutions to become an impact generator. Each platform has various committees and working groups that develop content (white papers, roadmaps, joint commitments, etc.) providing a space for science-based discussions and opportunities to advance new solutions. Involvement in these working groups and committees also provides valuable insight for the entire Bayer organization on trends, needs and expectations of other stakeholders, including consumers, NGOs, etc.



At the working group/committee level, a cross-functional team of subject matter experts (SMEs) represent Bayer during meetings, sharing Bayer perspective and facilitating input/review from our contributors on content creation. The leadership team drives their representation by providing strategic direction, endorsement and steering. The SMEs also channel insights back to the leadership team, as well as the business strategy, contributors, and R&D. These teams then integrate insights, lessons learned and new knowledge into decision-making and process. The integration of these stakeholder engagement activities allows the business strategy to integrate the outcomes into Bayer’s strategy, making it more sustainable and impactful.

Bayer engages with stakeholders on sustainable development issues and incorporates the outcomes of these activities into its strategy and operations. These platforms are important opportunities to come together with different stakeholders such as customers, business community, non-governmental organization (NGO), academia and more to co-create new solutions. Bayer’s involvement in these platforms allows its participation in key global initiatives to advance sustainable development goals. Finally, these multi-stakeholder platforms enable transparent exchange fostering trust, which creates opportunities for Bayer to advance sustainable business solutions across the world.

Dec 16 (Reuters) - Bayer AG (BAYGn.DE) has finalized a $698 million settlement with the U.S. state of Oregon to resolve claims that it polluted the environment with chemicals called polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, the German pharmaceutical company and the state said Thursday.

The deal, first disclosed in August, follows similar agreements with five other states and the District of Columbia, and with a nationwide class of municipal entities. Bayer still faces several other state lawsuits over PCBs.

The company said in a statement that it did not admit liability as part of the Oregon settlement, and would continued to defend the remaining cases.

Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum called the settlement a ""huge win"" that would give the state resources to clean up PCBs.

The lawsuits against Bayer stem from PCBs manufactured by U.S. seeds and pesticide company Monsanto, which Bayer acquired for $63 billion in 2018. Monsanto sold PCBs from 1935 until 1977, when it voluntarily ceased production.

The chemicals were once used widely to insulate electrical equipment, and in carbonless copy paper, caulking, floor finish and paint. The U.S. government outlawed PCBs in 1979 after discovering links to cancer.

In addition to lawsuits by states and cities, Bayer is facing claims by hundreds of people who say they were harmed by PCBs in fluorescent lights at a Washington state school. Some of those cases have gone to trial and resulted in jury verdicts against Bayer totaling $543 million, which the company is appealing.

Over 100 years later, UPS innovation involved—well, bikes again.

“Throughout our history, we’ve said, ‘Let’s find new ways to deliver that are cost effective, efficient, increase our productivity, and use the resources we have widely,” said Laura Lane, executive vice president and chief corporate affairs and sustainability officer at UPS.

At Fortune’s Impact Initiative summit on Wednesday, Lane shared that the 115-year-old UPS finds lots of innovative ways to close the gap and help the company achieve its commitment to be carbon neutral by 2050. And that innovation includes an e-bike delivery system that started in 2012 on the streets of Hamburg, a solution that has since been expanded to dozens more cities.

While there is no easy solution to developing sustainable strategies and solutions to drastically curb climate change, experts agree that substantial capital investment is required. Jennifer Jenkins, chief sustainability officer at Rubicon Carbon, said research shows that $3.5 trillion must be spent each year between now and 2050 to develop the right sustainable technologies to save the planet.

“We need all the solutions we can get,” said Jenkins. Rubicon Carbon launched just this week—with an initial capital commitment of $300 million from private-equity firm TPG’s climate investment fund.

Rubicon Carbon is aiming to address concerns about carbon credits, which saw a steady increase in corporate interest as companies made net-zero pledges and other climate commitments. But the credits market hasn’t always been built on reliable methodologies that ensure corporate commitments result in actual improvements.

“We are aware that we will draw criticism because there are people out there who do not believe in offsets,” said Jenkins. A solution, she said, is better methodologies, enhanced monitoring, and ultimately empowering companies that are coming to Rubicon Carbon, because those firms are authentically working to decarbonize their supply chains.

“I have a lot of faith in technology and improvement in methodologies, and standards, and data so we can really monitor projects, and they can continue to have the kind of impact we need them to have to reach the net-zero goal by 2050,” said Jenkins.

At German-based pharmaceutical giant Bayer AG, the last big reinvention as it pertains to sustainability occurred in 2018, when Bayer bought Monsanto, the world’s largest seeds firm. With the new company evenly split between health care and agriculture, Bayer needed to develop a sustainability strategy for the agriculture portion of the business.

“Even an old company like Bayer needs to reinvent itself from time to time, otherwise it is not going to survive,” said Klaus Kunz, head of ESG external engagement and performance reporting at Bayer.

But there are some cases in which the sky is quite literally the limit. As UPS aims to move toward carbon neutrality, it is faced with the harsh reality that 60% of its emissions come from the air. Electric planes are an innovation that’s being explored in markets like the Middle East and Australia, but this isn’t yet a widely adopted solution. “There is a huge tech gap to close and address how we take emissions out of the air,” said Lane.

Kunz said that sustainability solutions should be shared not only by large organizations like Bayer, but also the millions of farmers they work with.

“You can embed carbon, climate, and even ecosystems when you can measure, but you need to do it in a way that is credible,” said Kunz.","How UPS, Bayer, and Rubicon Carbon are driving impact through sustainable technology"

Creating additional opportunities for farmers to be an integral part of a more sustainable food value chain, Perdue grain farmers may be compensated for participating in a carbon footprinting program and eligible for future incentives tied to adopting regenerative farming practices, along with receiving access to all ForGround benefits.

The collaboration represents two industry leaders coming together to help decarbonize grain farming, supporting Perdue's production of increasingly environmentally friendly ingredients and foods for businesses and consumers.

Collaboration expands Bayer's industry-leading ForGround platform with the potential to enable even more growers to benefit from regenerative agriculture practices in the future.

ST. LOUIS, Sept. 21, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Today, Bayer announced a groundbreaking regenerative farming collaboration with Perdue AgriBusiness aimed at large-scale carbon emission reductions and creating a model for a more sustainable food value chain spanning across Perdue's entire grain network.

The collaboration – a first-of-its-kind under Bayer's new ForGround platform – leverages the strengths and scale of both organizations to create a blueprint for businesses to assess their carbon footprint and rapidly scale up their ability to reduce Scope 3 emissions. Through the collaboration, Bayer and Perdue AgriBusiness, the international agricultural products and services business of Perdue Farms, are creating additional opportunities to help support farmers on their regenerative agriculture journey, benefiting their land and helping them produce more environmentally friendly foods and ingredients for businesses and consumers.

While farmers provide nourishment for billions of people, agriculture accounts for nearly one-quarter of all worldwide greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (according to the IPCC).1 Acknowledging that the solution to this global problem is too large for any one company, industry, or entity to solve, Bayer and Perdue have come together as industry leaders and innovators to begin paving the way for a more sustainable agriculture future.

""Today's announcement represents a great milestone for our company, and ForGround, as we continue to shape the future of agriculture and drive global-scale change,"" said Leo Bastos, Head of Global Commercial Ecosystems, Bayer CropScience. ""The strengths of Bayer and Perdue, combined with our leading positions in agriculture, allow us to push new boundaries that can not only drive impact in our own organizations but can become scalable to others across the agricultural industry and beyond.""

In August, Bayer announced ForGround, a digital marketplace that helps farms of all sizes more easily make the transition to regenerative farming practices and supports businesses in the agrifood value chain lower their Scope 3 GHG emissions. A leader in premium protein and agriculture, Perdue Farms is a vertically integrated business spanning the value chain and connects its farmers and the outcome of their sustainable practices directly to consumers interested in knowing how their food is produced.

Through this ForGround collaboration, Bayer and Perdue demonstrate how companies can create a mutually beneficial model that supports and incentivizes farmers interested in sustainable practices while reducing the companies' own carbon footprints.

Farmers who supply grain to Perdue may be compensated for tracking their carbon footprint and gain access to all ForGround benefits including science-based agronomic support, a free subscription to Climate FieldView™ Plus 2 , and cost savings such as equipment rebates, agronomic tools, and service discounts.

, and cost savings such as equipment rebates, agronomic tools, and service discounts. In addition, through ForGround, Perdue grain farmers may be eligible for additional incentives tied to adopting regenerative farming practices, with tailored support to meet each farmer wherever they are on their own regenerative agriculture journey.

The emission reductions achieved through the regenerative farming practices adopted by Perdue grain farmers improve the sustainability of the value-added foods and ingredients that are used to produce Perdue's portfolio of products.

The program is focused on enrolling farmers who supply Perdue with corn or soybeans. The goal is to first understand their carbon footprint and then identify the best path to lower the greenhouse gas intensity of the grains the farmers produce through the adoption of regenerative farming practices – in turn, improving the sustainability of the ingredients and foods produced with those grains.

Based on the broad scale of Perdue's commodity sourcing network, the collaboration has the potential to take over one million metric tons of CO2e a year out of the atmosphere and sequester it in the ground.3 If achieved, this would counter-balance the greenhouse gas emissions from over one billion pounds of chicken4, or the equivalent of approximately 200,000 vehicle emissions.5

""By taking concrete steps to decarbonize our supply chain, this collaboration with Bayer is an example of Perdue's continued commitment to environmental sustainability,"" said Perry Aulie, Senior Vice President of Value-Added Products for Perdue AgriBusiness. ""We're constantly seeking additional avenues for our farmers to get credit for their hard work, and this new program offers opportunity for both incentive and impact for these important stewards of the land.""

As a fourth-generation, family-owned, U.S. food and agribusiness company, Perdue has committed to aggressive environmental sustainability goals, including reducing greenhouse gas intensity by 30%6 within its own operations (Scope 1). ForGround provides a platform for Perdue to go even further, measuring, tracking, and incentivizing farmers to adopt more sustainable practices to decarbonize Perdue's up-stream value chain (Scope 3).

""This collaboration is the first example of our ability to create a program within our ForGround platform to meet the needs of our business customers,"" said Bastos. ""Through our size and scale, Bayer is uniquely positioned to help companies achieve their sustainability goals – and get farmers rewarded for their sustainable farming efforts.""

Enrollment will be available for Perdue grain farmers starting this fall. Farmers may visit bayerforground.com for more information about enrollment. Companies interested in ForGround by Bayer opportunities may visit bayerforground.com/companies to learn more about reaching their sustainability goals.

Bayer and Perdue will be participating in a live stream panel discussion during Climate Week where members of the media and others interested may attend to learn more about the collaboration. The session will be hosted by the International Emissions Trade Association (IETA) on September 21 at 1:00 pm EST. Register and tune in here.

St. Louis, Missouri, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Agricultural seeds and chemicals maker Bayer AG (BAYGn.DE) on Monday launched a digital farming platform that it says will help U.S. growers enact environmentally friendly practices and connect them with companies seeking more sustainable food, feed and biofuel ingredients.

The effort will help the seed and chemical giant diversify its revenue stream, capitalizing on a decade-long farm data collection effort.

Bayer's ForGround platform will tap weather, soil, seed and farming practice data to make recommendations about how growers can boost soil health, cut emissions and reduce water use and chemical applications. Environmental outcomes would then be certified by a third-party verifier so that farmers can potentially sell their grain for a premium, Bayer said.

The program would also allow companies such as food makers and biofuel producers to create incentive programs for farmers to grow crops in a way that would help companies meet their environmental goals.

Bayer will charge companies a flat or per-acre fee for the services, and make money from farmers through seed and chemical sales and data-platform subscriptions. The launch initially targets U.S. agriculture but the company envisions broadening it to other countries, though no timetable is set yet, Bayer said.

The offering builds on Bayer's Carbon Program which pays farms for pulling climate-warming carbon from the atmosphere and locking it in the soil.

It is among the latest initiatives by agriculture companies aiming to meet rising demand for sustainably produced food, and to profit off data collection through subscriptions for new technology. read more

""This is a challenge and a key benefit for agriculture. But it's also a challenge and a benefit for companies that have made sustainability commitments around the world,"" said Leo Bastos, head of global commercial ecosystems at Bayer CropScience.

The program taps Bayer's strategy to use deep pools of agricultural and climate data to make farming more efficient and to verify and monetize environmental benefits.

ForGround requires that farmers enroll in Bayer's Climate FieldView platform, where growers log data about agricultural practices such as no-till farming or planting cover crops.

Climate change is a significant concern for farmers, as it impacts the crops they grow, and ultimately our food security. An unpredictable climate with prolonged droughts, heat waves, and historic flooding endanger harvests around the world. Intense windstorms, for example, can damage crops like corn – the second most widely-grown crop in the world – causing it to break. As the climate changes and extreme weather intensifies, the stakes for global food security become even higher.



At Bayer, we are working towards a better world for everyone, guided by our vision of ‘Health for All, Hunger for None’. One of our many missions to bring this vision to life is to support farmers with crop improvements that are more resilient against the threats of climate change, helping them to secure harvests and allowing them to better feed a growing world population in a sustainable way. Innovations like our short stature corn hybrids, which will be part of a Smart Corn System, become key enablers as they grow 30-40% shorter than conventional corn making the crop more stable, which means it is less likely to break or fall over in strong winds. This increases the chance of a better harvest and gives farmers the confidence to weather the storms ahead. Through science, we are working on making every day better.

The sustainable packaging innovation challenge invites innovators and technologists to share biodegradable, compostable, dissolvable, or edible packaging designs. Formats of interest include sachets and flexible or rigid tubes.

Solutions should:

• Be sourced from biobased or renewably sourced materials.

• Be scalable.

• Be compatible with existing packaging production lines.

• Be cost effective.

• Be validated by a third party for biodegradability, compostability.

Bayer is also interested in barrier films that can be applied to biodegradable or renewably sourced materials — but without negatively affecting their end-of-life biodegradability.

Keiko Tago, head of packaging sustainability at Bayer, answered Packaging Digest’s questions about the innovation challenge’s submission criteria and how this project fits into the company’s overall commitment to sustainability.

Why create an open innovation challenge instead of researching supplier offerings directly? What do you think this project will do for you that you can’t do any other way?

Tago: To accelerate our technology scouting and overall sustainability goals, we are pursuing both strategies: collaborating with our existing suppliers and at the same time reaching out for external innovation. The open innovation challenge with yet2 allows us to tap into their strong experience and a deep network of leaders and innovators in sustainable packaging, which we think will help us find the right partners and maximize the impact of our sustainability commitments.

Your goals are to be “climate neutral by 2030 and net zero by 2050.” What do you mean by climate neutral? What does net zero mean?

Tago: We refer to the article https://www.bayer.com/en/sustainability/climate-protection where we outline our goals to be climate neutral — through the reduction of emissions and, following reduction, through offset by purchasing certificates through climate protection projects with recognized quality standards — and have net zero GHG [greenhouse gas] emissions, including our entire value chain by 2050.

Why focus on packaging biodegradability when there is little infrastructure for composting in the US?

Tago: Our portfolio has a global footprint, and we understand that waste management differs from region to region. We are seeking a variety of solutions that might be applicable to our products, including those that are home compostable and do not require specific infrastructure.

You’ve set guidelines for oxygen and moisture barrier properties. In the past (and present, I believe), most degradable materials lose their degradation characteristics when they add a barrier layer or coating. What is different now in the material technologies or science to overcome this barrier?

Tago: The packaging industry is highly motivated to increase barrier properties of degradable materials. We have seen significant innovation in barrier properties using coatings and laminations recently, particularly in the food packaging area. We would like to encourage this trend, particularly for smaller companies at early stages of development where funding may be difficult to find.

Why include dissolvable and edible packaging for consumer healthcare goods?

Tago: We want to encourage innovators with particularly novel materials that could be relevant to consumer healthcare, even if their prior focus was on other industries.

How will this challenge accelerate Bayer’s efforts to make 100% of consumer health packaging recyclable or reusable by 2030?

Tago: This is a way to increase awareness that Bayer is open to explore innovation and partner to utilize the experience of others with existing developments in this space. We currently have multiple sustainable packaging projects with some of those at an early stage of development.

Planetary health may not be what immediately comes to mind when you think of Aspirin, but they’re more connected than you might realize.

Bayer AG has initiated several “100 million challenges,” including its recent investment in sustainable health products to advance the company’s 2030 sustainability commitments. They’re pouring €100 million to further enable sustainable innovation, production, and consumption of Consumer Health products including global brands such as Aspirin, Bepanthen, Claritin, and Elevit.

We’ll get to the packaging details shortly. But first, it’s important to see the connection between human health and the environment. “When you think about the environment and climate issues, we're talking about the environment as a social determinant of health,” says Daniella Foster, Global Vice President and Head of Public Affairs, Science, and Sustainability for Bayer’s Consumer Health division. “Reflecting on the past 20 years, we know that climate change has been a cause behind a growing number of health concerns, and we also know that underserved populations are particularly vulnerable.”

The company is setting out to tackle the inclusive growth challenge and environmental challenge together, looking to protect people's health in both the short- and long-term, while also reaching science-based targets.

Bayer’s plan includes (1) prioritizing sustainable brands, products, and packaging, (2) urging collective industry action, and (3) targeting carbon emissions, including net zero by 2050.

One of the concepts that attracted Foster to Bayer is that they no longer separate business strategy and sustainability strategy. “They’re integrated and we bake sustainability into our business and how we think about our value chain,” she says. “The renumeration of our Board of Management is tied to our sustainability strategy and progress. So, it’s a core part of how we operate. We also have an external sustainability council that reviews our plans and progress, and they pressure test us.”

Bayer is attempting to make 100% of its consumer health packaging recyclable or reusable by 2030. The company also aims to be net zero by 2050.

To further progress toward its sustainability targets, Bayer is leveraging open innovation as a strategic asset, powered by its long-time partnership with yet2, to identify promising external technologies. ""We look forward to bringing in the expertise from specialists in the area of sustainable packaging,” said Keiko Tago, Head of Packaging Sustainability, Consumer Health. “Designing and developing more sustainable packaging, as early as possible in the product design and development stages, is vital to reduce the impact on our environment and achieve Bayer’s ambitious sustainability goals,” said Tago.

Current packaging is designed to meet rigorous product protection requirements. This frequently results in waste, however, which does not break down when discarded and is not sourced from sustainable materials. Bayer said it is now seeking biodegradable, compostable, dissolvable, or edible packaging that ensures its products maintain their efficacy and quality standards. Packaging formats of interest include sachets and rigid or flexible tubes. Potential solutions include packaging materials derived from seaweed or plant extracts, such as alginate, starch, bagasse, cellulose, or mycelium; chitosan; agricultural waste; and more.

Business Review talked to representatives of large companies in Romania and highlighted several solutions that can ensure a greener and safer future for the coming generations. Implementing sustainable urban development, water management, and farming, supporting businesses with green finance, and finding ways to lower carbon emissions in all our activities are among the actions that could be part of the solution.

Ana Gheorghiu, Public Affairs, Science & Sustainability Lead Romania, Bulgaria, and Republic of Moldova at Bayer: “For us, caring for sustainability is not an additional activity, but a fundamental element of our strategy and operations. As one of the global leaders in the fields of health and nutrition, we want to make a significant contribution to a high quality of life on a healthy planet: through our activities and products, we contribute to the sustainable improvement of agriculture and food security, as well as to access to quality healthcare products and services. At the same time, we seek to reduce our own environmental footprint in our operations, conserving biodiversity and reducing environmental impact.

When it comes to agriculture, we are aware that globally, more than 70% of available freshwater is used in the production of food, fuel and plant-based fibres or is needed in animal husbandry. The agricultural sector is therefore a major consumer of water. As a leading crop science company, we have a huge responsibility. We will not be able to bring the company’s vision of ‘Health for all, no one without food’ to life without considering water.

In addition, we face a worrying paradox: it is projected that by 2050, our planet will need to provide food for around 10 billion people. This will require a lot of water. Using water in a more sustainable way and growing ‘more crops per drop’ is the challenge we need to address globally. Technology and adapted farming practices could be part of the answer.

At the heart of our local sustainability strategy for the Crop Science division is identifying the right agronomic solutions to address climate change, which is having an increasingly visible impact in our geographic area. So we are trying to provide farmers with the right tools to manage the available water in the best possible way, whether it’s precision farming, drought and pest tolerant hybrids or new plant protection products with more favourable environmental profiles, which together lead to reduced water consumption, labour and energy. We want to increase farmers’ performance and profitability by using fewer resources, protect the environment – water, soil, biodiversity, and demonstrate that agriculture is part of the solution in response to major global challenges.

Because we have maize seed production and processing activities in Romania, at our station in Sinești, Ialomita, we implement specific technologies and methods that reduce the amount of water needed for cultivation. A combination of practices such as drip irrigation, integrated weed management and minimum tillage can contribute to higher water retention, allowing more water availability for crops.

Also, plant breeding, new technologies, data collection, improved accuracy of weather forecasts help farmers to make the best decision for their crop based on the weather. We have an excellent tool at our disposal, Bayer’s precision farming solution – Climate Field View, which tells us the soil’s potential to grow a crop, i.e. the content and requirements of nutrients, water or weed, disease or pest pressure. Based on the data generated, farmers can adapt inputs (i.e. water, pesticides, fertilisers) to be as efficient as possible, optimising production by using the right resources, in the right quantities and exactly where needed.”","Ana Gheorghiu, Bayer Romania: Sustainability is a fundamental element of our strategy and operations"

A new collaboration between Bayer and Perdue AgriBusiness, the international agricultural products and services business of Perdue Farms, offers another opportunity for farmers to receive compensation for adopting regenerative practices and tracking their carbon footprint.

The collaboration is the first of its kind under Bayer’s new ForGround platform. ForGround is a digital marketplace that helps farms of all sizes more easily make the transition to regenerative farming practices. In addition, it creates a blueprint for businesses to assess their carbon footprint and reduce GHG emissions.

Farmer incentives

Farmers who supply grain to Perdue may be compensated for tracking their carbon footprint. Producers can also gain access to all ForGround benefits including science-based agronomic support, a free subscription to Climate FieldView Plus, and cost savings such as equipment rebates, agronomic tools, and service discounts to reduce transition cost barriers

The program is focused on enrolling farmers who supply Perdue with corn or soybeans. The goal is to first understand their carbon footprint and then identify the best path to lower the greenhouse gas intensity of the grains through the adoption of regenerative farming practices – in turn, improving the sustainability of the foods produced with those grains.

Perdue grain farmers may be eligible for additional incentives tied to adopting regenerative farming practices, with tailored support to meet each farmer wherever they are on their own regenerative ag journey.

Dustin Madigan, director of operations at Engel Family Farms in central Virginia, says their farm has played with many carbon opportunities in the past, but none were a great fit for their operation – until they enrolled in this program. Engel Family Farms already works closely with Bayer and Perdue and Climate FieldView is their primary data management tool, so the process of onboarding was ""quite comfortable.""

""We've had a commitment to reducing our environmental footprint, like air and water quality, for a long time now,"" Madigan says. ""The formal framework [of this program] is going to make us more accountable and help us keep better records to make sure we're moving in the right direction from year to year.""

“By taking concrete steps to decarbonize our supply chain, this collaboration with Bayer is an example of Perdue's continued commitment to environmental sustainability,” said Perry Aulie, Senior Vice President of Value-Added Products for Perdue AgriBusiness. “We’re constantly seeking additional avenues for our farmers to get credit for their hard work, and this new program offers opportunity for both incentive and impact for these important stewards of the land.”

Agriculture accounts for nearly one-quarter of all greenhouse gas emissions. This collaboration has the potential to take over one million metric tons of CO2 each year out of the atmosphere and sequester it in the ground. If achieved, this would counter-balance the greenhouse gas emissions from over one billion pounds of chicken, or the equivalent of approximately 200,000 vehicle emissions.

At this year’s Fruit Logistica taking place in Berlin from February 8-10 Bayer highlights its solutions towards regenerative agriculture (Bayer booth: hall 1.2, stand C23), meaning the balance between productivity outcomes and environmental protection, while supporting the needs of society and farmers. Key to regenerative agriculture is partnering with players along the whole food chain. “The pressure on food systems is rising each year. To nutritiously feed a growing world population while protecting the planet’s boundaries, we need to produce more food with less resources and develop solutions that can cope with climate change,” said Inci Dannenberg, President of Global Vegetable Seeds at Bayer’s Crop Science Division. “The challenges are so big and multi-faceted that they can only be addressed if we join forces.”

Biologicals innovation with tremendous environmental and business potential

One pillar in that collaborative approach towards regenerative agriculture is Bayer’s advancement in Biologicals, in other words agricultural inputs that are derived from biological instead of synthetic processing. The company has recently entered multiple promising collaborations in that space which will be showcased at Bayer’s booth at Fruit Logistica.

Bayer just lately entered a strategic partnership with Spanish biologicals company Kimitec focusing on accelerating the development and commercialization of biological crop protection products, as well as biostimulants to promote plant growth. Bayer also entered a partnership with French company M2i Group to supply fruit and vegetable growers around the world with pheromone-based biological crop protection products. In 2022, Ginkgo Bioworks became a multi-year strategic partner with Bayer to develop biological solutions in areas such as nitrogen optimization, carbon sequestration, and next generation crop protection.

Driving the development of biologicals is promising as it addresses environmental and business potential likewise. While it reduces the impact on the environment the biologicals market is expected to grow to nearly €25 billion by 2028.1.

Advancing sustainability and access to essential nutrients through seed innovation and food chain partnerships

The world is not only facing food insecurity, the need for a more sustainable and regenerative food system, and climate issues but also a nutrition gap. Bayer, through its Vegetables by Bayer business along with its Seminis® and De Ruiter® brands, has been developing various innovative solutions to address these challenges. Examples that are highlighted at Fruit Logistica include Strabena tomato with excellent attachment to vine and improved shelf life reducing the need for plastic packaging, Orange Candy® melon with good field holding and longer shelf life helping to reduce losses, or the Huntington sweet pepper which is a climate resilient variety. Bayer will also present its comprehensive offering to fight the tomato virus (ToBRFV), one of the biggest challenges for growers. This includes the De Ruiter® varieties with Intermediate Resistance2 to ToBRFV, such as Strabini, already growing commercially in many glasshouses and the two new varieties Ferreira and Novero recently launched in North America and Mexico.

To enable access to essential vitamins and minerals, particularly in underserved communities, Bayer, through The Nutrient Gap Initiative, also engages in direct intervention, education and advocacy. Originally an initiative by Bayer’s Consumer Health division, Bayer’s Crop Science division will also be part of it from 2023 onwards adding the importance of access to essential nutrients from fruits and vegetables.

Another example of how Bayer is contributing to food security and nutrition supply through engaging with partners along the food value chain is the company’s effort to curb the spread of Tropical Race 4 (TR4). This disease threats the existence of the banana as it is known. It causes a lethal wilt in banana plants and an infested plantation will lose its entire production for that year, and potentially several years more. Bayer has engaged with the Global Alliance Against TR4 and, through a module of its BayG.A.P. program, has trained hundreds of banana farmers on prevention against TR4. BayG.A.P. is a service program which supports and educates farmers worldwide to get certified and connected to the food value chain.","Bayer focuses on partnerships, sustainability, and innovation"

The new CoverCress™ cash crop has the potential to decrease nitrogen loss, help store carbon in the soil and improve soil health.

Investment delivers on Bayer’s commitments to sustainability and may help decarbonize agriculture and reduce reliance on nitrogen fertilizer with combined expertise of existing investors, Bunge and Chevron / Growers to gain new revenue streams through potential commercialization of oilseed crop for renewable fuels and livestock feed with ecosystem benefits of a cover crop / Advancing existing Bayer ownership in CoverCress Inc., a Leaps by Bayer portfolio company since 2015, underscores the value of nurturing and supporting breakthrough innovations that can create positive benefits for humanity

MONHEIM, Germany, August 3, 2022 /CSRwire/ – Bayer, Bunge (NYSE: BG) and Chevron U.S.A. Inc. (Chevron), a subsidiary of Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX), have signed a shareholders’ agreement in connection with Bayer’s acquisition of a 65 percent majority ownership of the winter oilseed producer CoverCress, Inc. (CCI). The remaining 35 percent of CCI will continue ownership under Bunge and Chevron.

CoverCress™ is a rotational cash crop which combines grain production with the environmental benefits of a cover crop without displacing other harvests. Oil extracted from CoverCress™ grain is designed to achieve a lower carbon intensity score and can be made into renewable diesel with Bunge’s expertise in oilseed processing and Chevron’s proficiency in fuels manufacturing. This farm-to-fuel supply chain represented by CCI, Bayer, Bunge and Chevron aims to give corn and soybean growers another revenue outlet by providing the world with a desirable fuel product and high-protein meal for animal feed.

“CoverCress is exciting because it has the potential to become an important source for biofuel production as a new harvested rotational crop, while giving growers an innovative option to continue effective stewardship of their land and improve soil quality by acting as a cover crop,” said Rodrigo Santos, Member of the Board of Management of Bayer AG and President of the Crop Science Division. “As a global leader in crop science, we are committed to decarbonizing agriculture and helping farmers around the world become more sustainable through game-changing products and solutions that can impact climate change. This investment and collaboration between industry leaders is another proof point for our efforts.”

Aligning the combined expertise of Bayer, Bunge, and Chevron with the potential held by CoverCress™ will position CCI to further develop and commercialize its namesake winter oilseed into a rotational cash cover crop with potential sustainability and carbon sequestration benefits and bring a new lower carbon fuel feedstock to the renewable diesel industry. CCI, which will continue to operate as an independent entity, has developed CoverCress™ as a unique crop whose grain is a lower carbon, low-input source for fuel and feed.

“Since our founding in 2013 we have actively sought – and benefited from – scientific, operational, and financial support from our academic and strategic partners. The progress we have made in converting pennycress into our novel, lower carbon intensity oilseed technology, CoverCress™, would have been much slower without this critical support,” said Mike DeCamp, CEO and president of CCI. “Our long-standing strategic partnership with Bayer and our more recent strategic partnerships with Bunge, and Chevron have provided us with access to expertise and capital that positions CCI very well for future success.”

By leveraging expertise and backing from leaders in fuels, soybean crushing, logistics, and crop sciences, CCI will be positioned to deliver on its full potential via a supply chain that understands its crop’s production, growth, processing, and delivery needs from the ground up.

“Connecting the full value chain – from seed development to end consumer – is an important step to bringing this crop to market at scale,” said Greg Heckman, Bunge’s Chief Executive Officer. “We look forward to helping meet the growing demand for renewable fuels with this next generation lower carbon feedstock.”

Growers in North America will soon gain access to this cash crop that provides the benefits of a cover crop as well as being harvestable for use as a renewable fuel feedstock.

“Chevron is seeking to create innovative renewable fuel feedstocks by collaborating with America’s farmers,” said Mark Nelson, Chevron’s executive vice president for Downstream & Chemicals. “We are excited to work with Bayer and Bunge to accelerate the adoption of CoverCress™, which we believe can ultimately be used to help supply the U.S. transportation system with lower lifecycle carbon intensity fuels.”

Farmers plant traditional cover crops to protect and improve their soil, not to harvest. Developed by converting field pennycress through breeding and gene editing tools, CoverCress™ is a new low-input rotational cash crop that has the ecosystem benefits of a cover crop. When added into corn and soybean rotations on land during the winter, CoverCress™ has the potential to decrease nitrogen loss, help store carbon in the soil and improve soil health.

CCI has been a portfolio company of Leaps by Bayer, the impact investment arm of Bayer for the past seven years. The success that CCI has achieved in the face of high risk and uncertainty, shows the value of supporting breakthrough innovation that can solve major problems for humanity.

It operates through three segments: (i) Pharmaceuticals (roughly 6 billion euros of EBITDA); (ii) Consumer Health (about 1.5 billion euros of EBITDA), and (iii) Crop Science (approximately 6.5 billion euros of EBITDA). The company acquired Monsanto in 2018 for 54 billion euros and has since been plagued with several lawsuits related to Monsanto's Roundup herbicide product causing cancer.

Activist Commentary: Inclusive Capital Partners is a San Francisco-based investment firm focused on increasing shareholder value and promoting sound environmental, social and governance practices. It was formed in 2020 by ValueAct founder Jeff Ubben to leverage capitalism and governance in pursuit of a healthy planet and the health of its inhabitants. As a pioneering active ESG (""AESG"") investor, Inclusive seeks long-term shareholder value through active partnership with companies whose core businesses contribute solutions to this pursuit. Their primary focus is on environmental and social value creation, which creates value for shareholders.

As an impact-focused investor, Inclusive's portfolio companies always have a dual mandate of being a compelling value proposition and generating a measurable positive impact on the environment and society. The firm's thesis at Bayer is no different. Inclusive believes that Bayer, as a leader in the global agribusiness industry, is well-positioned to develop and proliferate technology which addresses humanity's challenge of boosting food supply in the wake of increased global demand while also decreasing environmental impact.

Crop farming is a large contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions. Bayer's crop science division accounts for approximately 25% of global crop farming. Bayer has been doing a good job at its core value objective of increasing crop yields and agricultural productivity by using innovative technologies and developments in crop science that also offer substantial positive environmental impact. For example, their short-stature corn adds 15% more productivity while also retaining more carbon in the soil and resulting in less waste than standard tall corn varieties that are more easily knocked over by the wind. Also, dry rice seed has the potential to increase yield per acre and produces less methane emissions than wet rice. Additionally, Bayer is working to advance gene-edited crops using CRISPR technology, which Inclusive believes will be more accepted and faster to move to market than genetically modified crops. Emerging crops, including those that are gene-edited, are expected to offer a myriad of benefits, such as improving yields, thus decreasing agricultural land demand and deforestation and reducing reliance on pesticide and fertilizer. Ultimately, these crops result in increased food security and yields of staples like corn, wheat, rice and soy.

Inclusive highlights Bayer's incumbency in crop science exemplified by the company's size, talent, significant cashflow and a $2 billion R&D budget. All of this can be used to acquire, develop and scale emerging technologies with the potential for systems change. Inclusive's focus on impact at scale is why the firm sees the conventional ESG approach to ""reject and replace"" imperfect incumbents as insufficient to address global challenges.

Often Inclusive invests in companies where ESG improvements drive shareholder value. In this case, it is almost the opposite: Creating shareholder value in the form of a higher stock price and a lower cost of capital will allow Bayer to finance additional ESG opportunities that will also increase crop yield and profitability.

There are several ways to create this shareholder value. First, the board should explore de-conglomerating, primarily by spinning off Monsanto, which would pave the way for a sale of at least the Consumer Health business. Bayer currently trades at approximately 7x earnings while its pure-play crop science peer, Corteva, trades at closer to 20x earnings. If Monsanto got a 20x multiple as a pure play, even after deducting $10 billion of litigation liability, it would be worth the entire market cap of Bayer today. Second, the company could put this Roundup-related litigation to bed with a global settlement. Between August 2018 and May 2019, Bayer lost three lawsuits. This resulted in approximately $11 billion in settlements. However, the company has won its last six lawsuits, which should make settling the remainder easier. Even a $10 billion global settlement would likely benefit the stock price as it would remove a ton of uncertainty and make Bayer a buyable stock for many investors who would not touch it right now. Third, Inclusive is looking to bring in a new CEO as early as its next annual meeting in the spring of this year. Werner Baumann has been serving as CEO since 2016. In September 2020, the company extended his contract until the end of April 2024. Baumann was instrumental in the Monsanto acquisition and is probably the last person who would now support spinning it off and settling its claims. This needs to be done by a fresh CEO who holds no ownership over the Monsanto deal.

Inclusive is an amicable investor that is often invited onto boards and rules by the power of persuasion. We expect this situation to be no different, particularly since the firm is likely receiving a lot of support from other shareholders who have shown their displeasure for many years. In 2019, Baumann lost a vote of no confidence at the company's annual meeting, with 55.5% of investors voting against ratifying the top management's actions. In March 2022, Temasek Holdings (a 3% shareholder at the time) called for the replacement of Baumann as CEO. In April 2022, shareholders voted against a management compensation plan.

Jeff Ubben has always liked companies that were misunderstood by the market, and he has another one here. Due to the Monsanto litigation, Bayer is perceived as a bad actor and is somewhat uninvestable to many. Spinning off Monsanto and settling the litigation should remove that stigma. Focusing on the ESG innovations that increase crop yield and efficiency will change the company's image to one of impact and value. This is a prime example of how Inclusive actively and qualitatively uses ESG and activist value creation together to benefit shareholders.

Bayer AG has initiated several “100 million challenges,” including its recent investment in sustainable health products to advance the company’s 2030 sustainability commitments. They’re pouring €100 million to further enable sustainable innovation, production, and consumption of Consumer Health products including global brands such as Aspirin, Bepanthen, Claritin, and Elevit.

We’ll get to the packaging details shortly. But first, it’s important to see the connection between human health and the environment. “When you think about the environment and climate issues, we're talking about the environment as a social determinant of health,” says Daniella Foster, Global Vice President and Head of Public Affairs, Science, and Sustainability for Bayer’s Consumer Health division. “Reflecting on the past 20 years, we know that climate change has been a cause behind a growing number of health concerns, and we also know that underserved populations are particularly vulnerable.”

“I’ve spent a lot of time in the ESG space, and oftentimes when we talk about the environment or climate, we're usually just talking about the environment. I think one of the key pieces here that we're really trying to unite and put a focus on is that connection between human health and the environment.” —Daniella Foster

Data suggests that approximately half of the world's population does not have access to basic and essential health services, while the same populations are often in communities significantly impacted by climate, resulting in being hit from multiple sides. “Rising temperatures, poor air quality, pollen counts, all these things are increasing… this leads to heart disease, respiratory illnesses, allergies, etc. For people without access to medical care, they're really having a hard time managing or treating these conditions. This also impacts their ability to work. In some cases, it's perpetuating a cycle of poverty,” she explains.

The company is setting out to tackle the inclusive growth challenge and environmental challenge together, looking to protect people's health in both the short- and long-term, while also reaching science-based targets.

Bayer’s plan includes (1) prioritizing sustainable brands, products, and packaging, (2) urging collective industry action, and (3) targeting carbon emissions, including net zero by 2050.

One of the concepts that attracted Foster to Bayer is that they no longer separate business strategy and sustainability strategy. “They’re integrated and we bake sustainability into our business and how we think about our value chain,” she says. “The renumeration of our Board of Management is tied to our sustainability strategy and progress. So, it’s a core part of how we operate. We also have an external sustainability council that reviews our plans and progress, and they pressure test us.”

Products and packaging

Bayer has been making headway in improving the sustainability of its products and packaging for a few years, obtaining data to determine where impact can be made and how best to prioritize efforts.

With the €100 million investment, Bayer explains it is “committed to finding new solutions that inspire the sustainable creation and consumption of the company’s over-the-counter products and supplements.”





The company is targeting that by 2030 (where quality and safety permit), 100% of Bayer Consumer Health’s packaging will be recyclable or reusable and all packaging will include consumer-friendly recycling information, and the division’s packaging will include an average of 50% recycled content and 100% of purchased paper will be sustainably sourced.

In setting packaging targets, Bayer assessed the recyclability of their portfolio and identified the formats used at highest volumes—paper, plastic bottles, blister packs, and flexible tubes. Next, they evaluated the current recyclability of these formats and the technical and financial feasibility of conversion into recyclable packaging solutions, setting priorities accordingly. Their progress thus far includes:

Shipping boxes included 80% recycled content by the end of 2021 . Many initiatives already taking place at manufacturing sites gave Bayer a baseline toward the goals. Additional transformation has been driven by strong partnership with their supplier network, and continued sharing of best practices among sites. ( Editor’s note: Bayer chose not to reveal its packaging suppliers.)

( C onversion started for paper packaging across global brands including Aleve, Claritin, Iberogast, and Redoxon to use certified paper from responsibly managed forests.

including Aleve, Claritin, Iberogast, and Redoxon to use certified paper from responsibly managed forests. A program was implemented to transition to digital marketing and reduce the footprint of the division’s printed promotional materials. Bayer has worked on prioritizing digital marketing for years, which Foster explains “makes sense from both a sustainability standpoint and reaching the consumer where they are. For instance, in some of our Latin American markets at Bayer, the government-approved use of leveraging QR codes helps educate users on a range of health topics. Consumers are getting much more comfortable with QR codes thanks to restaurants and stores incorporating them during the pandemic. Instead of printing brochures or other materials, we can create much more dynamic and sustainable content to help people take better care of themselves. ”

Bayer has worked on prioritizing digital marketing for years, which Foster explains “makes sense from both a sustainability standpoint and reaching the consumer where they are. 100% of new product development projects are assessed for sustainability performance across health, the environment, and access.

With partnership and collective action being so powerful, Foster says she was particularly excited for the Q4 2021 launch of the Global Self Care Federation (GSCF) Environmental Charter. The GSCF counts Bayer, Sanofi, GSK, and J&J among its members working across competitive lines to deliver carbon emission reductions and more sustainable packaging. “I think this charter was a really great example of how an industry can come together in this area of environmental action and determine the areas where we all want to see progress and whereby working together, we can get farther quicker,” she says. “This is going to be critical. I always say—especially when we're talking about environment—no one company, entity, government, etc. owns the environment. We all have to work collectively and collaboratively to reach the UN sustainable development goals. I see it much more as a team sport.”

Similar to Consumer Health, a priority area for Bayer’s Pharmaceutical division is to create change within their operations, which includes switching to green electricity and investing in projects to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in their production facilities. The Pharma division is also working to reduce the ecological footprint of their products, but with prescription drug packaging oriented toward function, there is less optimization potential than on the Consumer Health side. While too soon to tell, Foster notes that there may be knowledge that comes from GSCF efforts that apply to pharmaceutical packaging: “When you crack that code and get to that solution, which is going to take a lot of time, then that paves the way for solutions to potentially be scaled where it makes sense, where you can ensure safety, efficacy, etc.”

Tangibles in cutting carbon

Many companies are looking to reach climate neutrality and net-zero emissions with supply chains responsible for such a large proportion of an organization’s global emissions. Bayer has an overarching commitment to climate neutrality by 2030 (Scopes 1 and 2) and net zero across the entire value chain (Scopes 1, 2 and 3) by 2050.

Progress in Consumer Health to-date includes:

Reduction of carbon footprint across production facilities through energy efficiency and renewable energy projects, contributing to a 30% reduction in carbon emissions between 2019 and 2020 alone. As Foster explains, “When we move, we move fast.” This includes upgrading HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) systems, representing “very unsexy but really critical updates when you're talking about energy efficiency and reduction,” she says.

65% of energy consumed at three Consumer Health production sites (one each in Germany, Guatemala, and Spain) is generated from renewable sources.

Bayer has monitored its carbon footprint for some time, so they had a good base understanding of their Scope 1 and 2 footprints. Their Board of Management set the intention to be climate neutral by 2030 and empowered the company to prioritize this across the value chain. Their science-based targets have been reviewed and endorsed by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi).

The company also has a partnership with CDP [formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project], which aims to make environmental reporting a business norm. Bayer is also working with suppliers to obtain data and understand some of the biggest opportunities to work on together on reducing their carbon footprints. Approximately 73% of Consumer Health suppliers have submitted their data.

Expanding access

Accessibility to products is a major goal for Bayer Consumer Health—they set the target of expanding access to everyday health for 100 million people in underserved communities by 2030. “We know that in underserved communities, having access to over-the-counter products, nutritional products, and supplements in many cases serves as a health lifeline. We see a lot of people who are in health deserts as well, without access,” says Foster. “Layering on top of the access piece, health education and literacy are also incredibly important, and they're often overlooked. The right information and education can be extremely powerful, and we're seeing this highlighted in the midst of the pandemic we've all been living in.”

For various underserved communities, Bayer has spent time researching ethnographies to understand the challenges they face and access gaps that can be bridged, and then overlayed that information with medical needs. This way, Bayer can tailor and design access to products with specific communities in mind. Beyond sustainability criteria, the company has baked the accessibility and availability of products into their innovation pipeline.

In the Pharmaceuticals division, Bayer set a goal to expand access to modern day family planning and contraceptives for 100 million women in low- and middle-income countries. “Some may ask why family planning? We know access to family planning is essential—it improves not only women's health, but it improves overall economic opportunities,” Foster says. “It's key in terms of tackling cycles of poverty and breaking down barriers to progress for gender equality. So that's how we start to unite some of these goals.” (On a related note, New York Times best-seller “Drawdown” on climate change solutions features chapters on family planning and educating girls as key sustainability practices in reducing greenhouse gases over time.)

Foster says that transparency in these “100 million challenges” is key—they keep metrics on their site and display their methodology as they look at improving access now, not just 10 years from now.

Bayer also launched its Nutrient Gap Initiative in 2021, which is focused on expanding access to vitamins and minerals for 50 million people in underserved communities by 2030. WHO data shows that one in three people suffer from malnutrition. “We see this being most critical for pregnant women because if you don't have the right nutrition, it impacts all aspects of your life. This can exacerbate the cycle of poverty if you have children that are not born healthy, lacking nutrients,” she explains.

Not only is this prenatal focus in line with Bayer’s fundamental principle that every child should have the best start in life, but scientific research shows the importance of multiple micronutrient supplementation (MMS), having been recently placed on the WHO’s list of essential medicines.

“We know that when pregnant mothers have MMS, there's less likelihood of stunting and cognitive delays. We've partnered with several NGOs—for example, we work closely with Vitamin Angels,” notes Foster.

This is not merely a donation program. Bayer is working to create systemic change and improve the health outcomes of women via interventions with local community and healthcare workers, with wraparound nutrition and educational programs to boost adherence and meet people where they are. “The idea is that the program offers 180-day micronutrient intervention,” she highlights. “That then becomes a part of the implementation research that helps the government assess and incorporate better antenatal care guidelines into the overall healthcare system to provide better care for women.”





While this takes time, effort, and partnership, Foster likens it to the old adage of teaching people to fish to provide long-term health outcomes versus giving people a fish to eat for a day. “We’re so committed… How do you teach and how do you provide the right tools so that someone is set up for a lifetime? We prioritize impact generation. We've had a great impact, even just in 2021 we reached 20 million people globally through the Nutrient Gap Initiative.”

Things are evolving in real-time, but Bayer is starting to see the unification of sustainable packaging and expanded access. The aforementioned digital solutions, for example, offer a lot of potential. “Data is showing that underserved communities get QR codes—people like them. They’re simple and easy to use,” she explains. “This is an area where we see potential to unite human health and the environment. On one hand, if you have QR codes, you eliminate the need for things like leaflets and you can probably reduce the size of your packaging. On the other hand, you can also start to build into that QR code things like health education, literacy, and additional tools so it's in one place and easy for the consumer. We’re already starting this in some of our regions, including in Latin America.”

Drivers from all sides

The move to more sustainable practices is driven by company goals, the financial world, consumers, and employees. Bayer’s mission is “health for all, hunger for none,” and as Foster emphasizes, it’s not just the sustainability mission but the company mission. “I'm driven by it. Our team members are driven by it. When you have that as your mission and you start to think about these different aspects of sustainability and the way that we've baked it into our business, that's how it all comes together.”

ESG [environmental, social, and governance] criteria has been in the investor lexicon in different forms for approximately a decade. But the past four years have brought heightened pressure, from Blackrock’s Letter to CEOs on climate change to ratings such as the Wall Street Journal’s ranking of the most sustainably managed companies in the world (in which Bayer is listed).

Foster notes that the pandemic has accelerated this pressure even further and has shown how critical sustainability is: “For myself and for other sustainability practitioners, we've been saying this for over a decade. I think the pandemic really highlighted two key things: one, the importance of environment and, two, the importance of human health. They're also completely linked, and you can't divorce the two.”

On the employee front, sustainability is less about what you say and more about transparency: what you're doing, why you're doing it, and how you're measuring it. She says, “What we're seeing at least at Bayer that really excites me is we have a whole organization mobilized behind sustainability, which I think is critical because sustainability shouldn't just be the job of people like me. If you're embedding it into your business, it becomes a part of everyone's job… and that definitely becomes a driver of retention, of employee satisfaction, and of pride.”

There is an increasing expectation for sustainability among consumers, particularly for household names. “For every single one of our brands, sustainability is baked into the brand’s purpose. It's not something separate on the side, it's just become a part of the ethos of how we think about our brands, our products, etc.,” she notes.

Consumers are ever more adept at spotting greenwashing claims. As organizations ask themselves about the areas they can influence and make meaningful change in the short-, mid- and long-term, transparency on progress and measurable goals are critical. Bayer’s site features a section on the auditing process they go through, and progress and methodology are shared in their annual sustainability report. “In any journey that's long and ambitious, you're also going to hit challenges, and that’s ok. Anything worth doing, you're going to have roadblocks,” says Foster. “But that’s another place where that full transparency of ‘here’s what we're seeing and here’s where we need to go’ is fundamental, and where collective action can help.”

Industry collaboration

Foster, who is co-chair of the GSCF Environmental Charter committee, says that collective action is key in scaling solutions to big challenges that are truly sustainable. “I also think when you talk about systemic challenges, whether it's waste systems or climate change as a whole, these are not the kind of challenges that one government, company, etc., is going to solve on their own, nor should they. We have to work together,” she says.

Beyond the power of working across competitive lines, opportunity also lies in working with suppliers. Reflecting on her previous experience at the State Department, Foster notes that she helped set up their first office of public-private partnership at a time when these partnerships weren’t the norm. Some of the most effective public-private partnerships she saw were in the areas of health—including PEPFAR focused on HIV/AIDS—where companies, NGOs, and governments worked together to identify effective solutions.

“Sometimes just making the commitment to come together and having very clear focus areas can be the hardest bit,” says Foster. “We're now doing that through the GSCF Environmental Charter, and I think that that is going to open up a world of opportunity as we start to talk about more sustainable solutions and materials, working collaboratively with suppliers.”

Matthias Berninger, executive vice president of Public Affairs at Bayer U.S., noted:

The water crisis is happening right now, everywhere on our planet – and we are still not doing enough to fight it.

Key findings

Highlighting how more than 2 billion people lack access to safe drinking water around the world, the survey found the following about Americans:

61% of Americans are concerned about “ensuring everyone has their fair share of clean water”

54% are concerned about the safety of their local water supply

57% are not sure if they have access to safe drinking water

73% say they don't drink water directly from the tap at home, but instead rely on filters or bottled water

60% say they are extremely or moderately concerned about the plastic used for bottled water

47% of people who drink bottled water come from households that earn less than $50.000 a year, highlighting the impact access to clean water can have on low-income households.

“The concrete, scalable solutions we need to combat the crisis are within our reach, but I believe to get us there, we need more commitment from the private sector, more wide-ranging cooperation, and overarching political action. At Bayer, our vision of ‘Health for All, Hunger for None’ mandates we do our part to make water accessible, clean and abundant,” added Berninger.

The study also underscores that, overall, Hispanic and Black Americans are more likely to be more concerned about water issues than their white counterparts.

The Run Blue campaign

In support of expanding education about the global water crisis, Bayer U.S. sponsors the Run Blue campaign of Mina Guli, a renowned water advocate who ran 200 marathons in the last year (March 2022 to March 2023) to raise awareness of water issues and inspire action.

“The world still turns a blind eye to our worsening water crisis, even though its effects are very real. I’ve seen how drought, dried up lakes, a lack of access to water or extreme events like floods shape people’s lives across the globe and in the US. Addressing the water crisis requires real action from everyone, including businesses,” said Guli.

Guli, who will complete his 200th marathon at the United Nations in New York on March 21, just before World Water Day, will close out the year by running with Bayer employees in Washington D.C. on the National Mall and in Central Park in New York City.

Water is “everyone's business""

Beyond scarcity, the water crisis seeps into different phenomena that affect communities, such as the increase in floods and storms, the warming of oceans and lakes, and contaminated water. Bayer U.S.'s latest efforts are out to stop this climate domino effect.

“Water is everybody’s business. It’s up to businesses across all sectors to voluntarily reduce the water footprint of their own activities, invest in innovations that help their customers to become increasingly water-smart, scrutinize their supply chains for planet-conscious water management, and incorporate water use in their investment decisions,” said Berninger.

Specific actions

As a leading company in agriculture and health, Bayer has joined the fight to combat the water crisis by developing innovative solutions for one of the most water-intensive sectors. Some of the current solutions include:

- Advanced breeding — With between 34-43% of the world’s irrigation water going to irrigated rice, finding solutions that boost the water efficiency of rice cultivation are critical. Bayer plant scientists continue to pursue modern breeding methods to develop locally adapted hybrids that have higher flooding and drought tolerance.

Arize hybrid rice seed AZ 7006 is specially designed to survive even in extreme flood conditions, producing consistent yields even under unfavorable weather conditions.

Arize 6444Gold, require less water, energy, labor and seeds than conventional transplanted rice.

- Irrigation technologies — With irrigation accounting for the lion’s share of agriculture’s water consumption, precision agriculture contributes to significant water savings as well as optimization of energy, labor and use of inputs such as crop protection and fertilizers. Bayer is partnering with irrigation pioneers like Netafim and BGN Tech to develop and promote automated irrigation systems that use up to 60% less water, and significantly less energy, than conventional irrigation. Bayer U.S. partnered with irrigation pioneers like Netafim and BGN Tech to develop and promote automated irrigation systems that use up to 60% less water and significantly less energy than conventional irrigation.

- Conservation Tillage systems (strip-till; no till) – The adoption of adapted tillage techniques reduces run-off, increases infiltration rates and decreases the evaporation of water in the soil, contributing to improved soil moisture and better soil quality, and ultimately, less water needed for irrigation.

As the newest addition to Bayer’s global LifeHub network, the company has said that LifeHub Monheim will bring together innovators, entrepreneurs, and scientists from all over Europe to share knowledge, experience and resources.

The aim is to help enable sustainable food security for the world’s growing population.

Bob Reiter, head of research and development, Bayer Crop Science Division said: “The challenges that agriculture faces in feeding a growing population in spite of accelerating climate change and extreme weather events, are bigger than anyone can solve alone.

“Making sure that we are a supportive part of the innovation ecosystem is a critical way to ensure that novel solutions for these issues get the support they need.

“Our global network of LifeHubs is an important way to connect with leading innovators locally and to support where Bayer can help make the most impact,” he added.

She will close out the year by running with Bayer employees in Washington D.C. at the National Mall and in New York City’s Central Park. Mina will complete her 200th marathon at the United Nations in New York on March 21st, just prior to World Water Day.

“The world still turns a blind eye to our worsening water crisis, even though its effects are very real. I’ve seen how drought, dried up lakes, a lack of access to water or extreme events like floods shape people’s lives across the globe and in the US. Addressing the water crisis requires real action from everyone, including businesses,” said Mina Guli. ""That’s why it’s so impactful for a company like Bayer to make water a priority in its operations, supply chain and innovations.”

Water is “Everybody’s Business”

The water crisis has a ripple effect that impacts many aspects of environmental concern. It is more complex than just water shortages; it is also about increased floods and storms, warming oceans and lakes, and contaminated water. In one of the biggest findings of the Harris Poll survey for example, three in four (73%) Americans say they do not drink water directly from the tap in their homes, relying on filters or bottled water instead. Interestingly, when asked to evaluate their level of concern about specific water issues, 60% of Americans said they were extremely or moderately concerned about the plastic used for bottled water. This is one ripple in the need for access to clean water. Separately, of those who drink mostly bottled water, half (47%) are from households earning less than $50,000 annually, highlighting the impact clean water access can have for low-income households.

“Water is everybody’s business,” Berninger adds. “It’s up to businesses across all sectors to voluntarily reduce the water footprint of their own activities, invest in innovations that help their customers to become increasingly water-smart, scrutinize their supply chains for planet-conscious water management, and incorporate water use in their investment decisions.”

As a leading company in agriculture and health, Bayer has joined the fight to combat the water crisis by developing innovative solutions for one of the most water-intensive sectors. Some of the current solutions include:

Advanced breeding — with between 34-43% of the world’s irrigation water going to irrigated rice, finding solutions that boost the water efficiency of rice cultivation are critical. Our plant scientists continue to pursue modern breeding methods to develop locally adapted hybrids that have higher flooding and drought tolerance. Arize® hybrid rice seed AZ 7006 is specially designed to survive even in extreme flood conditions, producing consistent yields even under unfavorable weather conditions. Arize® 6444Gold, require less water, energy, labor and seeds than conventional transplanted rice.

Irrigation technologies—with irrigation accounting for the lion’s share of agriculture’s water consumption, precision agriculture contributes to significant water savings as well as optimization of energy, labor and use of inputs such as crop protection and fertilizers. We are partnering with irrigation pioneers like Netafim and BGN Tech to develop and promote automated irrigation systems that use up to 60% less water, and significantly less energy, than conventional irrigation.

Conservation Tillage systems (strip-till; no till) – the adoption of adapted tillage techniques reduces run-off, increases infiltration rates and decreases the evaporation of water in the soil, contributing to improved soil moisture and better soil quality, and ultimately, less water needed for irrigation.

Research Methodology

The research was conducted online in the USA by The Harris Poll among 2069 adults between February 9 – February 13, 2023. Data are weighted where necessary by age, gender, race/ethnicity, region, education, marital status, household size, employment status (full-time/part-time), household income, and propensity to be online to bring them in line with their actual proportions in the population.

Respondents for this survey were selected from among those who have agreed to participate in our surveys. The sampling precision of Harris online polls is measured by using a Bayesian credible interval. For this study, the sample data is accurate to within + 2.8 percentage points using a 95% confidence level. This credible interval will be wider among subsets of the surveyed population of interest.

All sample surveys and polls, whether or not they use probability sampling, are subject to other multiple sources of error which are most often not possible to quantify or estimate, including, but not limited to coverage error, error associated with nonresponse, error associated with question wording and response options, and post-survey weighting and adjustments.

Summary Companies Q3 adjusted EBITDA 2.45 bln euros vs forecast 2.31 bln

Temporary glyphosate price boost as rival producers hit

Shares fall 2% as analysts worry about cost outlook















FRANKFURT, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Agriculture and pharmaceuticals company Bayer (BAYGn.DE) reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings as a temporary price boost for its glyphosate-based weedkillers made up for a decline in sales of its stroke prevention pill Xarelto.

The German company said in a statement on Tuesday that third-quarter adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) rose 17.3% to 2.45 billion euros ($2.45 billion), above analysts' average estimate of 2.31 billion euros posted on the company's website.

Bayer, which acquired glyphosate products as part of its takeover of Monsanto, is benefiting from a roughly 2.5 times jump in average glyphosate prices since early 2021 after hurricane Ida damaged rival producers, Chief Executive Werner Baumann told journalists in a call.

But finance chief Wolfgang Nickl said prices had already begun to drop during the third quarter. ""We expect them to normalize further in the fourth quarter,"" he added.

Bayer said its full-year outlook issued in August still stood, but added cost inflation would continue next year. Its shares fell 2.4%, erasing gains over the previous two trading sessions as analysts voiced concerns over the cost outlook.

Bayer has been hit by litigation costs over cancer claims by mostly individual users of glyphosate-based weedkillers, but demand for the products from farmers, the crop science unit's main customer group, has not been affected.

A recent string of five courtroom victories has encouraged Bayer to be stricter on legal settlements, which have cost it billions so far even after regulators declared the products safe.

The company said in August it was targeting 2022 adjusted EBITDA of about 13 billion euros, based on June 30 foreign exchange rates, up from 11.2 billion in 2021.

The crop science division saw adjusted EBITDA gain 33.5% to 629 million euros, beating a market consensus of 589 million euros, as a strong glyphosate business more than offset weaker corn and soy seed sales after U.S. farmers scaled back planting due to drought.

Bayer's best-selling drug Xarelto saw sales decline 6.2% to 1.11 billion euros in the quarter, slightly below market estimates, after competitive purchasing tenders in China weighed on prices and volumes there.

The founder and CEO of Ecovative Design and MyForestFoods Co. (previously known as Atlast) is inarguably one of the most active and prominent global players in the wonderful world of mycelium.

Here are just a few of Bayer’s incredible achievements since the last Q&A with vegconomist:

Nov 2020: Atlast Food Co launches its mushroom-based bacon alternative

April 2021: Ecovative raises $60M in a Series D, for mycelium based packaging, alt leather, and bacon.

April 2021: Atlast Food Co secures $40 million from investors including Robert Downey Jr.’s Footprint Coalition Ventures, bringing the total raise to $100M

Jan 2022: The launch of Forager, a division focused on designing, marketing, and manufacturing vegan, plastic-free leather-like materials and foams for the fashion and automotive industries

Jan 2022: Atlast rebrands to MyForest Foods as it prepares to upscale fungus-based bacon

This is a man with a lot to say about mycelium and mushrooms! Without further ado, let’s get into it.

Where did your interest in Mycelium begin?

It began as a kid growing up on a farm in Vermont, where fungi are abundant, you can see them literally holding the soil together. My interest in mycelium as a material really kicked off while I was studying at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI). That’s where professor Burt Swersey challenged us to “find a solution” as the final project for his Inventor’s Studio class, to design something according to his philosophy, “don’t do nonsense, do something meaningful.”

My classmate Gavin McIntyre (now our CCO) and I worked up the concept of using mycelium to grow materials. In 2007, with the support of Professor Swersey, we founded Ecovative, which focused on mycelium as a packing material (originally, we started with a focus on insulation, but the market wasn’t there yet). Since then, Ecovative has engineered new mycelium structures that match or out-perform plastic, leather, even meat, all of which turn to compost at the end of their useful life.

What was the thinking behind Atlast Food Co’s recent rebranding to MyForest Foods?

This has been a big year for MyForest Foods — the company is growing by leaps and bounds, quickly building a top-notch team of food innovation experts and preparing to produce at a whole new scale. It felt like the right time to take stock and ensure that everything was aligned to our mission of feeding the future delicious, nutritious mycelium-based foods, with a view to Nature as the foundation of it all.

“we are in the midst of an exciting year of growth”

What projects are you most excited about that you’re working on MyForest Foods?

In 2020, Ecovative launched a new company, now called MyForest Foods, that grows whole-cut meat from gourmet mushroom mycelium. As I mentioned before, we are in the midst of an exciting year of growth. Right now, we are hyper-focused on scaling up to provide more commercial products in 2022. We’re especially eager to get our flagship product, MyBacon, onto as many plates as possible, so that people whose diets are vegan or vegetarian or anyone who just wants to eat less meat can still “bring home the bacon”.

Speaking of scale, we recently partnered with Whitecrest Mushrooms Ltd., a huge gourmet mushroom farm in Canada, and adapted their existing facilities to produce nearly three million pounds of MyBacon each year, on less than one acre of land. With all the mushroom farms already in the world, eager to diversify what they produce, the ability to add MyForest mycelium to their product lines will be a game-changer.

“The bacon product is an example of what mycelium is capable of for food, and we think it opens a whole new category.”

We are also building two brand new facilities that will total 120,000 square feet of new infrastructure. Between a facility in Saratoga Springs, and the world’s largest mycelium farm here in the New York Capital Region coming online in the fall, we’re laying the groundwork for a truly monumental leveling up of mycelium production. It means we can continue producing our popular MyBacon, while working towards introducing new products in the near future.

How disruptive do you predict MyForest Foods’ bacon product to be, both to the animal-free and conventional bacon markets?

I wouldn’t call this product disruptive so much as essential, or foundational. The bacon product is an example of what mycelium is capable of for food, and we think it opens a whole new category. When you take a look at the numbers, over 80% of traditional meat sold is under the category of ‘whole cut’.

Despite their much smaller share of sales, and due to the nature of typical alt-protein ingredients they use, plant-based products are largely concentrated in the “ground” category of meats — think sausage or burger patties. This leaves the plant-based, whole-cut category wide open. Our star ingredient, mycelium, is grown—not ground—made of fibers aligned like muscles, so eating MyBacon is just like biting into a whole cut.

“Bacon is just the beginning”

Bacon is one of the bigger segments of this market and also a “can’t give up” item on many people’s shopping lists. MyBacon offers the texture of traditional pork bacon because our super-ingredient, mycelium, is similar in structure to meat. Will it disrupt real bacon? Only if enough people want the culinary experience without the usual cost to their health or the environment. But mycelium opens a much wider world of possibilities for the plant-based food category. Bacon is just the beginning.

Do you feel that interest in fungi and mycelium is a trend or here to stay?

Fungi have been with us for billions of years, so they’re definitely not a trend or passing fad, but I think the interest in fungi has deep roots and is going to last. Think of how useful plants are and have been for humanity — fungi is another whole kingdom of life on the same scale as plants and animals, and the value to society could also be comparable as we finally discover their potential as materials, food and more.

“The work of realizing a more sustainable and healthy relationship with our planet isn’t a trend, it’s our future.”

Mother Earth is facing mounting crises, and I think that’s part of why there is so much interest in fungi — they seem to offer hope of reconnection with Nature. They also offer hope for new ways of meeting human needs, including for food — lifecycle studies that compare pork production to mushroom cultivation show the dramatic potential for impact on factors like carbon emissions, land and water use. The work of realizing a more sustainable and healthy relationship with our planet isn’t a trend, it’s our future.

Congratulations on the launch of Forager – what will be the scope of this project?

Thank you! We’re very excited about it. The scope of Forager is to develop, manufacture and bring mycelium soft goods — leather-like hides, foams for use in shoes and other apparel, for starters — to market. Forager is doing this in partnership with some very big brands right out the gate, including PVH, Bestseller, and VivoBarefoot. Their market and product design expertise, combined with Forager’s mastery of mycelium manufacturing, will be the creative force that brings mycelium materials to the market. Consumers have been hearing about mycelium materials for years — Forager is how we put them in people’s hands.

What is the current status of Ecovative’s mycelium foundry and what makes it such a key facility?

The Mycelium Foundry is at the heart of our collaborations with other brands and industries. It’s where we put our massive library of fungi strains — the most extensive in the world — to work in meeting the needs of our partners, and in the process, we drive the science of mycelium materials forward.

In the example of Forager, a brand partner might have an idea for a vegan leather jacket design using mycelium hides. Their product developers communicate their needs to our Foundry scientists, who test strain after strain in a full spectrum of conditions to quickly find the right recipe for exactly the material they need.

That new development goes towards designing a new product, but it also informs every other aspect of our work, so development in mycelium leather could also make a difference in the growth of mycelium meat. In our growing network of companies and divisions — MyForest, Forager, Mushroom Packaging — Ecovative’s Mycelium Foundry is basically the engine of their progress.

Where do you see yourself and your projects in five years’ time?

I see myself working with Ecovative to prepare for the next, even bigger phase of scaling up, alongside MyForest foods and our other divisions, Forager and Mushroom Packaging. We know that mycelium offers a better way of meeting our material needs, but for that to happen, it has to happen at scale.

“Over the next five years, mycelium will be much more common in food, in the fashion and apparel and automotive spaces”

Over the next five years, mycelium will be much more common in food, in the fashion and apparel and automotive spaces, to name a few. I think by then, many more people will see the amazing potential of mycelium, and the adoption will grow very quickly. At that point, even the amazing growth we’re experiencing right now will seem like the prologue to a period of rapid discovery and the emergence of a whole new ecosystem of mycelium materials.","Eben Bayer: “Ecovative Has Engineered Mycelium Structures That Out-Perform Plastic, Leather, Even Meat”"

It’s the largest environmental damage recovery in Oregon’s history and “magnitudes larger” than any other state settlement over PCB contamination by Monsanto, Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum said. She described it as “vitally important” to the state’s land, air, water, wildlife and residents.

“I’m really, really excited that we’re able to bring this amount of money to the state of Oregon to be able to begin to resolve this terrible problem that we have,” Rosenblum said during a news conference. “When we start digging and understanding what is in our land what is in our water, it can really bring tears to your eyes. So let’s get this cleaned up so that our kids and our grandkids will not have tears in their eyes.”

Bayer said in a statement that the settlement over “legacy Monsanto PCB products” fully resolves all Oregon’s claims and releases the company from any future liability. The Oregon agreement contains no admission of liability or wrongdoing by the company, the statement said.

“The settlement terms reflect the unique challenges and trial procedures in this Oregon venue even though Monsanto voluntarily ceased production of PCBs in 1977 and never manufactured, used or disposed of PCBs in Oregon,” it said.

The settlement stems from a lawsuit filed by Oregon against Monsanto in 2018, claiming the company’s products polluted the state for 90 years until PCBs were banned in the 1970s.

PCBs, or polychlorinated biphenyls, were used in many industrial and commercial applications — including paint, coolants, sealants and hydraulic fluids. They still contaminate Oregon’s landfills and riverbeds and show up in fish and wildlife. Monsanto, which was based in Missouri, produced them from 1935 until 1977, two years before they were banned by Congress.

Oregon is the latest state to reach a settlement over PCB pollution associated with Monsanto products. Bayer, which acquired Monsanto in 2018 for more than $60 billion, says it has also reached agreements to resolve similar lawsuits with the attorneys general of Washington state, New Mexico, New Hampshire, Ohio and the District of Columbia.

Oregon’s $698 million settlement is the largest by far — nearly seven times that of the next largest settlement of $95 million reached with Washington state in 2020.

In Oregon, more than two dozen rivers and streams have tested positive for PCB contamination, and fish and wildlife in more than 40 watersheds have also shown signs of pollution, according to court documents.

Portland’s harbor sustained the most pollution because it was lined for a century with businesses that relied heavily on PCBs for manufacturing, metal recycling, fuel storage, railways and other industrial uses.

PCBs have been shown to cause a variety of adverse health effects, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. They can cause cancer in animals and affect their immune, reproductive and nervous systems. The agency has also found that they are probable carcinogens for humans.

A variety of fish species in Oregon are vulnerable because the PCBs accumulate in their fatty tissues. When seals, eagles, osprey, orca whales and humans eat those fish, that contamination is passed on, the lawsuit alleged.

In some cases, dead orca whales that washed up onshore have been treated as hazardous waste, according to the lawsuit.

The settlement money will go toward environmental remediation projects across the state, including natural resource damage assessment or restoration, air and water quality improvements, contaminated site cleanups and wildlife habitat protections, according to the lawsuit’s consent judgment.

The Oregon Department of Justice said it will work with the Legislature, the governor, and state agencies to decide how to allocate the funds.

In a separate settlement involving PCB litigation, Bayer has agreed to pay $650 million to about 2,500 local governments in the U.S., according to the company, which said those agreements don’t contain admission of wrongdoing or liability.

The partnership will happen through Bayer’s regenerative agriculture program ForGround.

Since its establishment in 2017, Nori has enabled 17 farmers to earn additional revenue and has paid out $1.8 million for the 117,000 tonnes of carbon they removed using regenerative agriculture methods across 35,387 acres of land. The new partnership with Bayer and its network of partner farmers will allow Nori to expand the land area associated with its marketplace ten times.

The company expects that the collaboration will allow them to reach five to seven times more Nori Carbon Removal Tonnes (NRTs) (One NRT is one tonne of removed CO2 equvalent stored for a minimum of ten years), thus expanding supply significantly.

Most of the farmers in the Bayer Carbon Program live in the Midwest U.S. and grow corn, soybeans and/or wheat in a rotation. They use regenerative agriculture practices like no-till, strip-till and/or cover crops on their enrolled fields.

“Bayer’s focus on [regenerative agriculture] with the recent announcement of its ForGround by Bayer platform makes our collaboration an ideal way to grow our marketplace and enhance our impact,” said Paul Gambill, CEO and co-founder of Nori.

LOUIS, MISSOURI, US — Bayer and Perdue AgriBusiness are collaborating on a regenerative farming program that aims to reduce carbon emissions and create a model for a more sustainable food value chain across Perdue’s grain network.

The first-of-its-kind program under Bayer’s ForGround platform draws on the strengths and scale of both companies. The program will provide support to farmers on regenerative agriculture practices.

“The strengths of Bayer and Perdue, combined with our leading positions in agriculture, allow us to push new boundaries that can not only drive impact in our own organizations but can become scalable to others across the agricultural industry and beyond,” said Leo Bastos, head of global commercial ecosystems, Bayer CropScience.

ForGround is Bayer’s digital marketplace that helps farms make the transition to regenerative farming practices and supports businesses in the agrifood value chain lower their Scope 3 GHG emissions. Perdue Farms is a vertically integrated business spanning the value chain and connects its farmers and the outcome of their sustainable practices directly to consumers interested in knowing how their food is produced.

The program is focused on enrolling farmers who supply Perdue with corn or soybeans. The goal is to first understand their carbon footprint and then identify the best path to lower the greenhouse gas intensity of the grains through the adoption of regenerative farming practices — in turn, improving the sustainability of the ingredients and foods produced with those grains.

Farmers who supply grain to Perdue may be compensated for tracking their carbon footprint and gain access to all ForGround benefits, including science-based agronomic support, a free subscription to Climate FieldView Plus2, and cost savings such as equipment rebates, agronomic tools, and service discounts.

Through ForGround, Perdue grain farmers may be eligible for additional incentives tied to adopting regenerative farming practices, with tailored support.

The collaboration has the potential to take over one million tonnes of CO 2 a year out of the atmosphere and sequester it in the ground. If achieved, this would counter-balance the greenhouse gas emissions from over one billion lbs of chicken, or the equivalent of approximately 200,000 vehicle emissions.

“By taking concrete steps to decarbonize our supply chain, this collaboration with Bayer is an example of Perdue’s continued commitment to environmental sustainability,” said Perry Aulie, senior vice president of value-added products for Perdue AgriBusiness. “We’re constantly seeking additional avenues for our farmers to get credit for their hard work, and this new program offers opportunity for both incentive and impact for these important stewards of the land.”

Perdue has committed to aggressive environmental sustainability goals, including reducing greenhouse gas intensity by 30% within its own operations (Scope 1). ForGround provides a platform for Perdue to go even further, measuring, tracking, and incentivizing farmers to adopt more sustainable practices to decarbonize Perdue’s up-stream value chain (Scope 3).

“This collaboration is the first example of our ability to create a program within our ForGround platform to meet the needs of our business customers,” Bastos said. “Through our size and scale, Bayer is uniquely positioned to help companies achieve their sustainability goals — and get farmers rewarded for their sustainable farming efforts.”

Enrollment will be available for Perdue grain farmers starting this fall. Farmers may visit bayerforground.com for more information about enrollment.

This collaboration brings together the expertise of three companies in digital, agri finance and payments technology to bear upon the task of expanding access to agronomic knowledge, products, services, and partnerships.

Over five years, the programme aims to benefit 10 million smallholder farmers in India by enabling them to gain access to formal financial services, Bayer said in a statement.

The smallholder farmers, who account for 86 per cent of India’s agrarian economy, have difficulty sourcing quality farm products and are often at the mercy of middlemen when it comes to pricing.

D Narain, President, Bayer South Asia and Global Head of Smallholder Farming said, “We are delighted to join hands with Rabo Partnerships and Mastercard to build a digital ecosystem that will further help smallholders in India. Through this partnership, smallholder farmers will not only gain easy access to agricultural advisory services and direct market linkages, but also build their credit profiles and lower their input costs through access to institutional credit, allowing them to increase efficiency, improve crop yields, and grow their profits significantly.”

Mastercard’s Farm Pass is a digital ecosystem platform that works offline, even with feature phones, connecting buyers, Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs) and other agriculture ecosystem players with farmers digitally, and helping them get the best value for their produce. The solution, which serves over 600,000 farmers in India and two million globally, creates a standard interface for farmers and buyers that facilitates greater efficiency in the agriculture value chain.

Nikhil Sahni, Division President, South Asia, Mastercard said, “As part of Mastercard’s pledge to connect one billion people to the digital economy, the company has been actively working with farmers in several countries to bring them onto a digital platform that directly connects them with buyers, empowering them to negotiate the best price for their produce. This is in line with the Indian government’s efforts towards inclusive growth by leveraging technology. The collaboration with Bayer and Rabo Partnerships is helping build an effective model of agricultural digitisation that can serve as a global example.”

Banks often find it difficult to serve the rural ecosystem effectively as most farmers don’t have a formal credit history, thereby limiting access to any formal financial services beyond the Kisan Credit Card and equipment finance.

To further provide financing access to farmers and FPOs, this partnership will continue to look at collaborations with local banks and financial institutions in India, to create greater value for smallholder farmers and the entire agri ecosystem.

This will be enabled through data-driven scoring tools deployed with partner financial institutions, along with credit analytics supported by Rabo Partnerships, which will give banks more comfort in serving smallholder farmers with a complete portfolio of financial services, including credit.

David Gerbrands, Global Head, Advisory & Inclusive Ventures, Rabo Partnerships said: “Rabo Partnerships aims to contribute to the improvement of farmer livelihoods worldwide. Achieving this requires sustainable partnerships, which is why Rabo Partnerships is excited to partner with Bayer and Mastercard to establish a scalable digital ecosystem, enabling farmers as well as other agricultural value chain partners with an array of services, including agro advisory, inputs procurement, marketing, and access to formal financial services.”","Bayer, Rabo Partnerships, MasterCard tie up to build digital ecosystem for agri-finance"

Beiersdorf had been working with WWF since 2018 in the western Indonesian province Kapuas Hulu District where it had founded a smallholders’ association ‘Mitra Bersama’ to spearhead plans for RSPO certification. The latest four-year extended commitment between Beiersdorf, Evonik and WWF now aimed to ensure all 200 members of this association, who jointly owned around 300 hectares of land, were certified according to RSPO standards before June 2026. Another goal of the commitment was to give these smallholders direct market access to a palm oil mill.

Connecting with Indonesian smallholders​

Longer-term, Beiersdorf and Evonik wanted to source palm (kernel) oil derivatives for products directly from this region, meaning certification of these smallholders represented an “important building block” ​in achieving this goal.

“Both companies have been committed for several years to the sustainable cultivation of palm oil and a transparent supply chain, and they share the target of deforestation-free sourcing,”​ Beiersdorf said.

According to the personal care major, the “first phase”​ of working with the smallholders, with the creation of an association and various training courses implemented, had laid a “solid foundation”​ for achieving the planned RSPO certification in the coming years.

In Borneo, Beiersdorf, Evonik and WWF would be working in the Indonesian part of the island, West Kalimantan, to “prevent further conversion of natural forests by promoting the cultivation of sustainable palm oil and improving the living standards of the local smallholders”​.

Silke Düwel-Rieth, head of business and markets at WWF Germany, described the extended cooperation as “exceptional” ​because it combined “transformative corporate objectives with local nature conservation”.​

“Together, we are strengthening sustainable palm oil production to preserve healthy, species-rich forest systems,”​ Düwel-Rieth said.

Palm oil, Indonesia and beauty​

According to Statistica, global consumption of palm oil sat at around 75 million tons in 2022, with Indonesia representing the largest producing country with over 40 million tons produced. The cosmetic, pharmaceutical, detergent and cleaning industries accounted for around 20% of this palm oil consumption last year.

But Beiersdorf said that, for the cosmetics industry, it wasn’t palm (kernel) oil directly that was being processed, rather so-called palm (kernel) oil derivatives – used as surfactants for foaming or as emulsifiers for a smoothing effect. The personal care major, for example, used around 30,000 metric tons of derivatives per year in the manufacture of its skin and body care products, including its Nivea and Eucerin brands.

However, since 2020, the company had been sourcing palm (kernel) oil derivatives entirely as RSPO Mass Balance certified (RSPO Certified Sustainable Palm Oil from certified sources that is mixed with ordinary palm oil throughout the supply chain) and had a the target of sourcing all palm-based raw materials deforestation-free by 2025 – part of its wider ‘Care Beyond Skin’ sustainability agenda.

Last year, Borneo-based wild harvest ingredient supplier Forestwise called on all international beauty brands to support local communities​ on the island and empower them to protect the remaining forests and wildlife it shelters. In 2021, WWF said it was certainly time for big beauty to “galvanise”​ rising consumer engagement​ around sustainability.",‘Deforestation-free sourcing’: Beiersdorf and WWF extend joint commitment on sustainable palm oil

Back in March 2020, long-standing previous chairman of the board at Beiersdorf Stefan De Loecker said climate change was “one of the greatest challenges of our time”​​ and pledged that the company would continue its sharp focus on addressing this. The company reiterated this position in its H2 2021 earnings, outlining the goal to transform Beiersdorf’s global production network to climate-neutral by 2030​.

The latest rollout of eco-valves and PCR aluminium cans formed part of this.

Patented eco-valve reduces GHG emissions​

Working with UK eco-valve specialist Salford Valve Company, Beiersdorf had integrated a “climate-friendlier aerosol valve system”​ for its Nivea EcoDeo line that it said ensured a higher yield per can resulting in a significant reduction in GHG emissions. The patented Salvalco eco-valve used eco-friendlier, inert cases such as nitrogen as a propellent for the aerosol sprays instead of conventional hydrocarbon propellants.

“As a result of a strong collaboration following the venture capital investment by Oscar&Paul Beiersdorf Venture Capital in 2020, Nivea is the first global brand to use this patented, climate-friendlier aerosol valve – taking the lead in its industry,”​ Beiersdorf said.

Michael Becker, head of global packaging R&D at Beiersdorf, said: “We share the vision of a climate-positive future with our partners at Salvaco and are excited to deliver now more climate-friendly aerosol products to our consumers.”​

Post-consumer recycled aluminium cans ​

Beiersdorf had also partnered with Swiss packaging specialist Nussbaum Matzingen to roll out 100% post-consumer recycled (PCR) aluminium cans across its Nivea Men deodorant ranges and most of the Nivea Men shaving gels in Europe. The new cans reduced CO2 emissions by 28% for the deodorant line and slashed emissions by 35% for the shaving gel line given recycled aluminium required around 95% less energy during production.

The cans, which had also been light-weighted, were now available in Germany and penned for a wider European rollout in 2022.

Markus Tomasini, CTO of the Nussbaum Group, said 100% of the primary aluminium had been replaced using drink can scrap as a starting material. “Tool and process innovation were the key to being able to process the high alloy content in the post-consumer recycled material,” ​Tomasini said.

Climate-neutral goals – packaging investments key​

Jean-François Pascal, vice president of corporate sustainability at Beiersdorf, said the company was “delighted and proud” ​with its latest two packaging partnerships aimed at accelerating Beiersdorf’s transformation towards a “climate-positive future”.​

“With these kinds of partnerships, we can take serious steps on our sustainability journey,” ​Pascal said.

Earlier this year in April, Beiersdorf also launched ‘climate neutralised’ renewable plastic jars​ across its Nivea Naturally Good face care range that it had co-developed with Saudi Arabian chemicals major Sabic. The jars rolled out worldwide in June, this year.

Beiersdorf had also been collaborating with manufacturing major Werner & Mertz and R&D institute The Fraunhofer Institute for Process Engineering and Packaging (IVV) for some time to co-publish a guidance document on the suitability of post-consumer recyclates in cosmetic grade packaging. The personal care major said the publication of this document earlier this year​ was designed to fuel urgently needed change in the category.",‘Climate-positive future’: Beiersdorf unveils eco-valves and PCR aluminium cans across Nivea aerosol ranges

The specialty materials innovator worked with Beiersdorf and several of its suppliers to help deliver packaging that was recyclable and lighter weight with no compromises in attractiveness, quality or performance.

""Eastman collaborated with us and several of our suppliers to offer solutions across the value chain,"" said Vicky Zong, Beiersdorf's Innovation Center Shanghai packaging development leader in Shanghai. ""This is very important to us because innovative packaging solutions play a major role in our company's sustainability agenda: CARE BEYOND SKIN.""

By 2025, Beiersdorf wants to achieve 100% refillable, reusable or recyclable packaging; increase the share of recycled material in plastic packaging to 30%; and, in the same period, reduce the use of fossil-based virgin plastic by 50% (base year 2019).

The Eastman technology team worked closely with Beiersdorf and its suppliers along the value chain to qualify the new process. Eastman's cellulose esters were key in ensuring the success of the technology, which involved switching from laminated paper to film-free paper in a process called ""transfer metallization."" Transfer metallization offers very high-quality appearance and results in packaging that is still recyclable.

""In this application, our cellulose ester release coating offers better appearance, better ink adhesion and better-balanced anti-folding and anti-blocking properties than alternative solutions,"" said Eric Zhang, Eastman market development manager in Shanghai.

The process has typically been used on very specialized packaging. Commitments by companies like Beiersdorf to reach ambitious sustainability goals have led to its wider use. Already, the outer packaging of seven new NIVEA product lines have been upgraded to this recyclable solution, which also can reduce the packaging's weight by up to 10%.

""The combination of our knowledge of cellulose esters and application development support is truly unique,"" said Leslie Montgomery, Eastman's segment market manager for coatings and inks. ""Our application expertise is unparalleled and comes from more than 60 years of experience working with cellulose esters.""

""This is a solution that other brands pursuing greater sustainability can adopt,"" said Christian Derbez, Eastman's sales director for coatings and inks in the Asia Pacific region. ""The key here is that we can make a difference down the value chain and respond to a trend with real solutions that help everyone involved.""

Indeed, the new Nivea Men “Climate Care Moisturizer”, which is scheduled to be launched as a limited edition in Germany in early June 2022, will be the first skin-care product to use an ingredient (ethanol) obtained from recycled carbon dioxide.

Exactly as Coty, Beiersdorf uses a carbon dioxide recycling technology that collects industrial emissions. First, the carbon dioxide is collected at specific locations such as industrial chimneys and diverted to a bioreactor, where it is then fermented and processed into a cosmetic ethanol.

Climate neutral skincare

The Nivea Men “Climate Care Moisturizer”contains a total of 14 percent ethanol that has been obtained through alternative methods. Moreover, the formula is 100 percent free of microplastics, silicones, mineral oils, and PEG/PEG derivatives. This men’s skin care product is manufactured using electricity from 100 percent renewable sources and is climate-neutralized. Indeed, the remaining CO2 emissions linked to the production have been compensated through certified climate projects.

Furthermore, the formula is 99 percent biodegradable, with fully recyclable packaging.

“This new men’s skin care product with the innovative CO2-recycling technology represents an important milestone for us,” says Jean-Francois Pascal, Vice President Sustainability at Beiersdorf. The group has set itself ambitious carbon-reduction targets, aiming to achieve an absolute decrease of 30 percent of its scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions and 10 percent of its scope 3 emissions group-wide by 2025 (using 2018 as a basis).",Beiersdorf to launch the world’s first skincare product with recycled CO2

Described as the first circular cosmetic packaging concept, Design4Circularity onboards expertise of Clariant, Siegwerk and Borealis

Value chain collaboration Design4Circularity achieves unique circular cosmetics packaging concept

Beiersdorf has teamed up with Clariant, Borealis and Siegwerk to launch Design4Circularity.

The cross-industry initiative is based on creating recyclable consumer packaging from 100% retrieved plastic packaging waste.

Key parameters taken into account by the collaborating companies included polymer and additive composition, material selection for the sleeve and bottle, the portability and de-inking of the sleeve material, recyclability and PCR quality.

Borealis brought high-quality PCR to the project based on its Borcycle M technology, while Clariant offered expertise in additive solutions to ensure PCR quality and protect against polymer chain breakdown in each recycling step.

The result, said the companies, was a high value PCR material that repeatedly hit the criteria of personal care packaging.

Ink manufacturer Siegwerk, meanwhile, provided ink systems, which, in collaboration with Beiersdorf and a sleeve manufacturer, allowed for a full body coloured sleeve featuring a new ink composition to allow de-inking of the sleeve within a recycling process.

The Design4Circularity bottle and shrink sleeve combination is intended for removal at a materials recovery facility.

Beiersdorf packaging expert Stefan Rüster said of Design4Circularity: “We follow an ambitious sustainability agenda including the vision of fully circular resources.

“The Design4Circularity packaging solution is groundbreaking for future cosmetics applications.

“Through the hard work and innovation power of all collaboration partners involved, we have managed to combine the high design requirements of a cosmetic packaging with full circularity.”

“This collaboration was possible because all participants are dedicated to circular economy, with company-wide programmes and holistic understanding of the systems involved,” said Richard Haldimann, Chief Technology and Sustainability Officer at Clariant.

“Achieving circularity needs a complete shift in designing product packaging and packaging raw materials, considering sortability, recycling and packaging end-of-life.”

Siegwerk’s Technology Head, Brand Owner Collaboration, Stefan Haep, called the initiative a “frontrunner in uniquely assessing circularity in every design parameter”, while Borealis’ Global Commercial Director, Consumer Product, Peter Voortmans, doubled down on the need for collaboration, stating: “Only together with like-minded partners can we shape an ‘ever mindful’ tomorrow.”

The companies note that further advancements in sorting technology are needed to achieve the ultimate goal of giving colourless bottles a second life in colourless applications.

They note that digital watermarking or AI could help facilitate such sustainability goals.

The idea was begun in late 2021 when Beiersdorf announced working to produce more sustainable cosmetics packaging using certified renewable polypropylene (PP) from global petrochemicals manufacturer SABIC’s TRUCIRCLE portfolio to replace fossil-based virgin plastic.

""We are proud to be a pioneer among our industry in the field of renewable plastic packaging,” says Jean-François Pascal, VP corporate sustainability at Beiersdorf. “The ambitious targets we have set ourselves with our Care Beyond Skin Sustainability Agenda are being put into practice with a great deal of commitment and hard work.""

Beiersdorf

The project began with a comprehensive analysis of the market for alternative plastics. Material requirements were stringent.

""Our excellent skin care products obviously include a high-quality packaging, which has to fulfill many requirements,"" says Michael Becker, head of global packaging development at Beiersdorf. ""On the one hand, this concerns visual and tactile features that our Nivea consumers are acquainted to, but packaging recyclability is also an important aspect for us in line with our vision of a circular economy that we aim to support.""

Another essential criterion in the selection of the raw material and the supplier was that the ""feedstock concept"", which for the Nivea Naturally Good face care packaging is based on a second-generation raw material: tall oil. Producing a cosmetic packaging from sugar cane or corn and thus using a source of food had been out of the question. ""The certified renewable plastic we source from Sabic has no visual effects or other adverse properties,” explains Hannah Rasel, Beiersdorf senior packaging specialist. “The jar made of renewable PP is neither visually nor haptically distinguishable from the previous packaging. In addition, SABIC pursues a holistic sustainability approach with its feedstock concept.”

Sustainable supplier.

Beiersdorf has also taken a new approach to the sourcing of the packaging concept, according to Isabel Hochges, Beiersdorf's chief procurement officer. ""We are now getting involved much earlier and deeper in the supply chain, where we are building new supplier relationships. Becoming more sustainable as a company also means driving the development of new materials along the value chain. We are going beyond our existing supplier relationships and bringing upstream suppliers together with our tier 1 suppliers to accelerate the transformation of our packaging materials towards sustainability.""

After identifying Sabic as a source, Beiersdorf connected the vendor with long-time trusted partner Berry Global to help speed the packaging changeover.

The result drove a rapid market introduction: The project took just nine months from idea to implementation.

“We need these strong partnerships along the value chain and are very pleased that we were able to establish such a good cooperation with our suppliers Berry Global and SABIC,"" explains Julia Wiedemann, global category manager sustainable packaging in procurement, Beiersdorf.

Achieving mass balance.

The packaging launch is based on the principle of mass balancing, in accordance with the International Sustainability & Carbon Certification (ISCC PLUS) scheme. The raw material base for the renewable plastic is certified renewable tall oil, which is a “second generation” feedstock and by-product of the forestry-industry. It seamlessly replaces crude oil in the manufacturing process — without the need to establish a separate production process.

Converting the packaging to renewable plastic not only has the advantage of conserving fossil resources, but also reduces carbon dioxide emissions. Approximately 76g of CO2 emissions are saved per jar produced, a reduction of around 60% compared to the fossil-based jar. The project therefore also contributes to the company's climate target of reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 30% absolutely across the entire value chain (Scope 1-3) by 2025. Any remaining emissions that cannot be avoided or further reduced during the manufacturing of the product are, for the first time, climate-neutralized via carbon offsetting through afforestation projects. This is new step for Beiersdorf and its largest skin care brand. The Nivea Naturally Good face-care range of eight products will be recognizable as “climate-neutralized” on-pack and on-shelf.",Beiersdorf Launches First Certified Renewable Plastic Packaging

Beiersdorf, the Hamburg-based cosmetics manufacturer, plans to use packaging made from recycled aluminum in future, a press release said Thursday (May 27, 2021). Beiersdorf is collaborating with the Swiss packaging company, Nussbaum, to launch the first aerosol cans e.g., spray deodorants, made from the sustainable material in late 2021. The companies have spent one year developing the production from old drink cans, Beiersdorf said.

Aerosol cans from old drink cans

""The outstanding feature of the technology is that no primary aluminum is used here at all, but rather sorted aluminum waste from beverage cans. We are thus using a raw material entirely in line with the circular economy,"" said Markus Tomasini, CTO of Nussbaum Matzingen AG. The reused aluminum requires up to 95 per cent less energy in the recycling process without any loss of quality. Plans are also being laid to procure all of the aluminum drink cans regionally to guarantee short material routes.

Beiersdorf aims to achieve own climate targets

""We are initiating a cross-industry rethink through our pioneering co-operation with Nussbaum along the supply chain and reducing our carbon footprint by up to 90 per cent in terms of aerosol cans,"" said Norbert Menzel, Principal for Packaging Technology at Beiersdorf. Apart from producing aerosol cans, Beiersdorf will gradually make its product range more sustainable and use recycled aluminum in packaging. The goal is a 30 per cent reduction in emissions along the value chain by 2025 over 2018, Menzel added. ""Our approach covers the entire value chain including suppliers, partners and logistics,"" said Jean-François Pascal, Beiersdorf Vice President of Corporate Sustainability. Last December, Beiersdorf began collaborating with the Sabic chemical company to develop plant-based cosmetics packaging.

Findings were initially due to be published at the end of last year,​ but delays meant the findings had only now been released. The Cosmetics Packaging Guidance​​ was being made available to the public “for the good of the environment” ​and “in the spirit of the open innovation approach”,​ the three companies said. Findings would also be shared with industry consortium CosPaTox (Cosmetic Packaging Toxicology).

A ‘solid foundation’ for proper handling of recyclates in cosmetic packaging​

Immo Sander, head of packaging development at Wener & Mertz said: “We have created a solid foundation for the proper handling of recyclates in the future and have shown that conformity to standards for cosmetics packaging made of post-consumer recyclates can be achieved and will be ensured.”​

Michael Becker, head of global packaging development at Beiersdorf, said the guidance would help manufacturers and brands like Beiersdorf, and all supply chain stakeholders, advance sustainable packaging agendas over the coming years.

“Our ambition is to substantially increase the proportion of recyclates in our plastic packaging (…) With the jointly developed guidelines, we want to actively contribute to giving the recycling industry orientation and assistance with the urgently required additional capacity of high-quality plastic recyclates for the cosmetic industry,”​ Becker said.

Beiersdorf said the initial aim of the joint research had been to create an industry standard that overturned uncertainties in the market caused by a lack of defined conditions in which recycled material could be used for cosmetics packaging under the EU Cosmetics Regulation (EC) No. 1223/2009​​.

By building an inventory of existing recyclates on the European market – existing recycling processes, available qualities and material properties – and comparing this with cosmetic packaging requirements under the EU Regulation, the document would be “a first industry-standard for cosmetic grade recycled plastic”​.

Beiersdorf said the research project and resulting guidance ultimately played into building circular business models for the beauty sector.

In April last year, the UK Cosmetic, Toiletry and Perfumery Association (CTPA) also shared guidance on use of recycled materials in plastic packaging​ which also aimed to debunk regulatory and technical hurdles.

By opting for a bio-based polypropylene resin, the cosmetics maker is reducing the production of fossil-based, virgin plastic

Cosmetics maker Beiersdorf has opted for a sustainable packaging alternative for Nivea’s Naturally Good day and night creams.

The German manufacturer will now house its skin care jewel’s products in a bio-based polypropylene resin from Saudi Arabian chemicals company Sabic.

The move is part of Beiersdorf’s sustainable packaging targets to reduce fossil-based, virgin plastic for its cosmetics products by 50%.

Meanwhile, the sustainable alternative will help Beiersdorf reduce its carbon emissions and environmental footprint, outlined in its Sustainability Agenda, Care Beyond Skin.

“We are excited to implement this important change in the packaging of our Nivea brand products and to be the first in the skin care mass market to use polypropylene made from second-generation bio-based feedstock on a global basis,” said Michael Becker, Head of Global Packaging Development at Beiersdorf.

“Together with Sabic, we have taken a major step forward in transforming conventional fossil-based packaging in the cosmetics and skin care segment towards fully sustainable material alternatives.”

Nivea’s new packaging will be phased in to points of sale from June 2021.

Produced entirely out of used beverage cans, the innovative aerosol packaging required a year of development.

The first Beiersdorf products in aerosol cans made from 100 percent recycled aluminium will be rolled out in the market as early as at the end of 2021.

The collaboration aimed to design a packaging solution that creates a cleaner input waste stream and finds its way back into the loop in high-value applications. It should also allow for the high-quality visuals and distinctive shapes consumers associate with cosmetics packaging and brands.

Colourless 100% PCR polyolefin bottle

To deliver on all these factors, the innovation centres on a colourless polyolefin bottle with 100% PCR [1] content, full body sleeved in a printed deinkable shrink sleeve.

To achieve full circularity, the packaging material needs to retain its optimal properties throughout multiple life cycles. Borealis therefore brought high-quality PCR to the project based on its Borcycle M technology, while Clariant offered expertise in additive solutions to ensure PCR quality and protect against polymer chain breakdown in each recycling step.

The result, according to the four companies, was a high-value PCR material repeatedly hit the high-end criteria of personal care packaging.

To achieve differentiation of the packaging despite using an uncoloured bottle, the four partners opted for a full body shrink sleeve. The bottle/shrink sleeve combination is intended for removal at a materials recovery facility. However, to increase the circularity of the solution, Siegwerk was able to provide inks designed to allow deinking of the sleeve.

Fully recyclable

Thus, all materials are technically fully recyclable with the potential to be recovered and used for the same application.

According to the four companies, first sorting trials in existing recycling infrastructure proved the sortability of the full body sleeved HDPE bottle, achieving a high recovery of the bottle’s material. Additionally, the project team conducted trials with full body sleeved, transparent PET bottles and achieved similar results.

However, further advancements in sorting technology are needed to truly give colourless bottles a second life back. “Technologies such as digital watermarking or artificial intelligence could help such sustainability goals to be reached,” conclude the four partners.","Beiersdorf, Clariant, Siegwerk and Borealis create a 100% circular bottle"

What Happened: Strategists from BlackRock Investment Institute, the research arm of BlackRock, recommend ""breaking up traditional asset allocation buckets, moving away from broad allocations to public equities and bonds,"" reported Bloomberg, citing a Tuesday note.

""These old assumptions do not reflect the new regime we're in — one where major central banks are hiking interest rates into recession to try to bring inflation down,"" the strategists said.

Specific Sectors: They recommend focusing at specific equity sectors, such as energy or healthcare, and selecting companies with robust cash flows and resilient supply chains that can withstand a recession, the report said.

""We believe in a new approach to building portfolios,"" where ""strategic views need to be more granular — across sectors and within private markets — to help build more resilient portfolios in the new regime,"" the strategists said, according to the Bloomberg report.

In the past, other experts, too, have presented arguments to re-look at the 60/40 portfolio in an environment where inflation continues to remain stubbornly high.

In November 2022, prominent economist Nouriel Roubini had highlighted how inflation hurts both stocks and bonds, and people should reconsider the classic “60-40” investment strategy.

Fixed-income Allocations: The BlackRock strategists also pointed out that investors should rethink fixed-income allocations and indicated they favor tactical allocations to inflation-linked bonds and short-term debt due to attractive yields and possibilities of enduring above-target price pressures.

Summary Companies Says no 'material changes' in approach from last year

Continues attempt to walk middle line on ESG issues

Comes ahead as AGM season kicks off















LONDON/BOSTON March 23 (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc, the world's largest asset manager, said on Thursday it would continue to push companies for details on how they treat ""material"" climate-related risks, despite criticism from some U.S. politicians for its stance on the energy transition.

The comments continue BlackRock's attempt to walk a middle line between Republicans who say it has overemphasized environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors in investing, and shareholder activists and other investors who say the $8.6 trillion asset manager should push companies harder to address climate issues.

In a statement on the priority areas it will focus on in talks with companies at the start of the season for annual company meetings, BlackRock (BLK.N) said while it had refined some language it uses, nothing substantive had changed.

Specifically, it would focus its engagements with portfolio companies on topics like on board quality and effectiveness; a company's strategy, purpose and financial resilience; executive incentives; climate-related risks and natural capital; and a company's impact on people, particularly its workers. Those talks can inform BlackRock's proxy voting decisions.

""There are no material changes in our approach to these themes, and our engagement with companies will continue the dialogue on material risks and opportunities relevant to their business models and sectors that we had in 2022,"" it said.

It said that environmental issues it would consider include ""water use, land use, waste management and climate risk.""

The statements were in line with recent comments by BlackRock Chief Executive Laurence Fink in his recent annual letter. Fink said BlackRock has been vocal in seeking company disclosures about their plans to navigate the energy transition, but that ""it’s not our place to be telling companies what to do.""

This is despite warnings first made public in a report by the NGO Earthsight in 2020, who labelled rampant forest destruction in Paraguay “the world’s worst deforestation crisis”.



Published today, Global Witness’ report builds on Earthsight’s devastating exposé, which accused meat-packing giants – Minerva and Frigorifico Concepción - of buying cattle raised by two ranchers responsible for land grabbing and forest clearance within the ancestral lands of Indigenous peoples in the Chaco.

Three years on from the explosive findings, Global Witness found that Minerva continued sourcing products from at least one of the deforestation-linked ranchers in 2021 - with no publicly available evidence found to date that suggests the company has dropped the ranchers as suppliers.

Despite the companies’ links to known deforesters in the Chaco, as well as the evidence from the Earthsight investigation being in the public domain, many leading financiers continue to invest in Minerva.

Global Witness’ investigation found that [2]:

In the EU: (between December 2020 and December 2022)

Netherlands: APG, the Netherland’s largest pension manager, almost doubled its investment in Minerva, increasing its shareholdings in the company from $7million to $13.7million

France: BNP Paribas substantially increased its investments, from $740,000 to $1million

Spain: the largest growth in shareholdings came from Spanish bank Santander, whose investment shot up a staggering 1,000%, from $70,000 to $770,000

In the US: As of December 2022, two US-based major asset managers, Vanguard, and BlackRock, still held significant shares in Minerva, totalling $13.3 million. This represents a substantial increase since illegal deforestation was first identified in Minerva’s Paraguayan supply chain in 2019.

Between September 2019 and December 2022

BlackRock’s investment shot up more than five-fold; from $840,000 to $4.78million

Vanguard’s investment almost doubled, from $4.54million to $8.56million

In the UK: HSBC was one of several banks that underwrote a $1.4 billion bond sale for Minerva in March 2021 – earning itself almost half a million dollars in the process.

Charlie Hammans, Civil Society Adviser at Global Witness, said: “Our investigation shows that many UK, European and American banks are failing to ensure their portfolios are deforestation-free and free of any associated human rights violations. Either these banks are failing to carry out effective due diligence or they are willing to side-line environmental and human rights concerns in favour of business as usual.”

“Indigenous Peoples are on the front line of climate change. They pay the price when commodities are produced illegally on their lands. It’s time that governments ensure that major financial players turn off the money pipeline to companies sourcing commodities from deforested land and Indigenous areas.”

All the financial institutions exposed – with the sole exception of Vanguard - are signatories of either the Net Zero Asset Manager Initiative or the Net Zero Banking Alliance. BNP Paribas and Santander are members of both. Both initiatives commit the banks or asset managers to reach net zero emissions by 2050, with all members advised to set a target to eliminate deforestation from their portfolios.

Other banks including HSBC, JP Morgan and Santander have collectively earnt over a million dollars underwriting bonds and assisting share sales for Minerva. Other financial institutions have underwritten Frigorifico Concepción’s bond sales, including Bank of America, which underwrote a $285 million deal for the company in 2021.

Rubens Carvalho, Head of Deforestation Research at Earthsight, said: “The level of carbon emissions from Chaco deforestation over the last few decades puts its climate change contribution on a par with higher profile deforestation frontiers in the Amazon and South-East Asia. Research has revealed the biome stores up to 19 times more carbon than previously thought. It is vital that urgent action is taken now to conserve this often overlooked but critical biome. The Paraguayan government itself has been complicit by failing to fulfil its obligations to protect indigenous land which is so important for our planet’s future.”

According to Global Forest Watch, Paraguay lost a quarter of its net forest cover between 2000 and 2020. The country now has one of the highest rates of deforestation in the world. Paraguay has lost an estimated 5.2 million hectares between 2001-2021, an area almost twice the size of Belgium - putting the future of the forest and the people who depend on it at risk.

Ana Romero, a representative of the Indigenous Youth Union of Paraguay, said: “Meatpackers are causing environmental issues, and significant social issues as well. Theirs is a capitalist system - which focuses on excessive consumption. We have to defend the rights of those that really defend our ecosystems – Indigenous peoples. These ranchers and meatpackers are destroying an ecosystem that they depend on too.”

The new investigation builds upon Global Witness’ Deforestation Dividends 2021 report – launched in the run up to COP26 – which showed that banks and asset managers based in the UK, US, EU and China made deals worth around $157 billion with just 20 agri-businesses implicated in deforestation between 2016 and 2020.

It comes as legislation in the European Union and the United Kingdom is set to ban the trading of certain commodities produced on deforested land and amid growing support for similar measures in the US.

However, these rules still currently allow UK and EU financiers to fund the production of forest-wrecking commodities. There are therefore growing calls to ensure that the new deforestation rules include obligations for banks and financiers, with MEPs in Europe and key British legislators backing such proposals. There are also efforts to table similar legislation in the US.



Giulia Bondi, Senior EU Forests Campaigner at Global Witness, said: ""Talk is cheap, and voluntary commitments from banks to stop funding deforestation are no exception. Time and time again, these voluntary initiatives have proven futile. Previous evidence uncovered by Global Witness revealed that, between 2016-2020, EU-based financial institutions were complicit in financing €30.6 billion in deals with 20 agribusiness companies accused of deforestation.



""The urgency of the situation cannot be understated: the European Commission must swiftly fulfil its commitments agreed in the new anti-deforestation law and propose rules to stop the EU-based financial institutions bankrolling forests destruction.



""The European Commission must also push ahead with its obligation to extend the new law to other wooded lands, which are vital carbon sinks but increasingly under pressure from large-scale agriculture activities.""","Major financiers including Santander, BNP Paribas and BlackRock have helped bankroll the “world's worst deforestation crisis” in Paraguay"

Why it matters: As the head of the world's largest asset manager, Fink’s letters are widely taken as a signal for how the financial community is thinking about certain topics, and how policy makers may need to respond.

Driving the news: His latest letter departs from those of the past several years, which focused largely on the need to incorporate climate risk, ESG concerns and broader corporate responsibility issues into how business should be conducted.

BlackRock is a top target of right-wing interest groups and Republican lawmakers, who have accused the firm — and specifically Fink — of pushing a so-called “woke” investing trend that does not serve investors' interests.

of pushing a so-called “woke” investing trend that does not serve investors' interests. Recently, several states have moved to pull money out of BlackRock funds, alleging the firm boycotts fossil fuels, which the company rebuts again in the new letter by touting its natural gas investments.

Between the lines: Fink’s latest dispatch deemphasizes ESG investing — increasingly a politically fraught topic — compared to his most recent annual letters. In fact, the term ESG does not appear anywhere in the letter.

The energy transition concerns are not raised until paragraph 18, and the word “climate” doesn’t appear until the eighth page of the lengthy letter. Even when it does, climate is only used five times.

Zoom in: Still, the letter indicates the company is not backing away from climate concerns.

""For years now, we have viewed climate risk as an investment risk. That’s still the case,"" the letter states.

Fink discusses the investment opportunities associated with the energy transition, potential financial repercussions from climate change-related extreme weather events and the need for companies BlackRock invests in to disclose their climate change-related risks.

Fink positions BlackRock as offering choices to clients. He also makes clear the firm does not direct companies it invests in to take certain actions on climate change or other issues, with a more hands off approach to proxy voting than in years past.

Yes, but: Fink's statement that asset managers including BlackRock should not set policy or ""be the environmental police"" contrasts with his 2020 letter to investors.

That letter stated: ""BlackRock does not see itself as a passive observer in the low-carbon transition. We believe we have a significant responsibility — as a provider of index funds, as a fiduciary, and as a member of society — to play a constructive role in the transition.""

The intrigue: Environmental groups cautioned against Fink's messaging on consumer choice in particular.

“Despite what BlackRock may say, the company appears to be giving ground to those who are trying to undermine the finance sector’s role in addressing the climate crisis,” said Cleo Rank, a sustainable finance analyst at InfluenceMap, a lobbying watchdog group.

What they’re saying: “[BlackRock is] the 800 pound gorilla here and they're definitely walking a tightrope,” Daniel Firger, managing director of Great Circle Capital Advisors, a climate finance consultancy, told Axios in an interview.",BlackRock CEO Larry Fink walks tightrope on climate investing

But when it comes to climate action, the giant asset manager isn’t presently all that far apart from its GOP detractors. Both BlackRock and congressional Republicans are fighting — albeit through different strategies — to defang a forthcoming regulation that would force companies to disclose their carbon emissions and the risks that climate change pose to their business models.

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has warned that climate risk constitutes an investment risk. But after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) proposed mandatory disclosure of those risks this spring, the $10 trillion asset manager is lobbying to weaken the final rule, according to a Lever review of BlackRock’s rulemaking comments, federal lobbying disclosures, and meeting memoranda from the SEC. So far this year, the investment firm reported spending nearly $2 million lobbying on finance issues that include climate risk and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) disclosure.

👇 Listen to journalist Rebecca Burns discuss this story.

The Wall Street Journal has described BlackRock as “walking a political tightrope” between activists on both sides of the sustainable investing debate. But the investment firm’s apparent attempt to undercut the type of measures it’s championed publicly for years instead suggests that it may have hit upon a more effective strategy for navigating the climate transition than the GOP’s outright denial. By aggressively growing the market for ESG funds — which typically net them higher management fees — while pushing watered down regulations and maintaining its status as one of world’s largest fossil-fuel investors, BlackRock can ensure that the climate crisis is a win-win-win.

SEC rulemaking, through which the agency interprets and adapts U.S. securities law according to the changes in the market, seldom garners broad public interest. However, the proposed climate disclosure rule has drawn a record-setting 14,000 comments, ranging widely in tone and content, from lobbying groups, institutional investors, elected officials, academics, and climate advocates.

Pushback on the rule stems from a predictable array of business groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, as well as Republicans in federal and state offices attacking the growing use of ESG criteria in investing. BlackRock, which has made ESG funds and disclosures mainstream, has become a central target of those attacks. On Thursday, Texas lawmakers grilled BlackRock executives about whether ESG policies are jeopardizing pension returns. A dark money group tied to conservative activist Leonard Leo has run TV ads accusing the firm of “harassing oil and gas companies, making them divest from fossil fuels.”

But in reality, BlackRock is largely aligned with its GOP critics on one of the biggest points of contention in the proposed SEC rule: the disclosure of so-called “Scope 3” carbon emissions that occur across a company’s value chain, including the impact of consumers burning fossil fuels that a company sells or helps finance.

Experts say that robust reporting of Scope 3 emissions is critical to giving the rule teeth; by contrast, a company’s direct emissions (Scope 1) and those associated with its purchase and use of energy (Scope 2) usually account for just a fraction of its overall footprint. While the GOP attacks the SEC’s statutory authority to require Scope 3 disclosures, BlackRock is pushing changes that critics say could render those requirements almost meaningless.

“We do not believe the purpose of Scope 3 disclosure requirements should be to push publicly traded companies into the role of enforcing emission reduction targets outside of their control,” the firm wrote in comments submitted to the agency.

BlackRock declined to answer specific questions from the Lever. But the firm has said there’s no contradiction between its past public statements and present private actions.

Environmental groups disagree. “BlackRock has publicly called for stronger regulation and government intervention over and over again,” wrote a coalition of 10 organizations including the Sierra Club and the Sunrise Movement in a statement responding to the firm’s rulemaking comments. “Disclosure is just the first step in an urgent and necessary regulatory framework to address climate risk. How can we expect BlackRock to support the more ambitious regulations and market interventions needed to actually reach a net zero economy?”

A Green Veneer On Business As Usual

Three years ago, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink proclaimed that “climate risk is investment risk” in his influential annual open letter to companies the firm invests in. Companies that fail to plan for the massive upheavals and new investment opportunities resulting from climate change will be left behind, Fink reasoned.

The CEO’s climate awakening, which reportedly occurred during a “boys’ trip” to Alaska with fellow bankers, didn’t change his fundamental convictions. “We focus on sustainability not because we’re environmentalists, but because we are capitalists,” Fink wrote in his 2022 annual letter, which also asked the companies BlackRock invests in to start issuing climate risk disclosures.

BlackRock’s ESG evangelism has drawn skeptics from many quarters, including its own former head of sustainable investing, who called the framework “a dangerous placebo that harms the public interest” by substituting green investment products and disclosures for meaningful action on the climate. Those disclosures are themselves a source of profit, and a separate BlackRock division now markets climate investment risk-modeling software to clients.

“Protecting an investment portfolio from the disastrous effects of climate change is not the same thing as preventing those disastrous effects from occurring in the first place,” former BlackRock executive Tariq Fancy wrote last year.

But Fink’s high-minded climate rhetoric has nonetheless provided fodder for right-wing grievances against so-called “woke capitalism,” a bizarre new front in the culture war. A report this month from Republican staffers on the Senate Banking Committee accused BlackRock and other asset managers of using their “shareholder voting power to advance a liberal political agenda.” Vanguard, one of the other investment firms targeted, has since walked back its climate commitments.

Meanwhile, Republican officials in at least five states have moved public pension money out of BlackRock, and the incoming House majority is now threatening antitrust investigations over what they term “climate collusion” against the fossil-fuel industry.

It’s true that the last few years have seen a marked shift in the climate posture of the corporate world. It’s increasingly rare to see a major corporation engaged in outright climate denial, and more than 800 publicly traded companies have released plans to achieve carbon neutrality by mid-century.

But in reality, many of those pledges amount to a green veneer on business as usual. Take the 2050 climate neutrality target announced by ExxonMobil this year, which covers the emissions required to produce half a million barrels of oil each day — but not the impact of customers actually burning all that oil.

According to the Net Zero Tracker, which assesses major companies’ climate pledges, most firms continue to omit the Scope 3 emissions that include consumer use of their products. Critics say this renders the pledges so narrow as to be almost meaningless. Retail giant Walmart’s stated strategy to achieve net-zero emissions by 2040, for example, ignores Scope 3 emissions despite the company acknowledging that such releases account for 95 percent of its total emissions.

In its own first report on climate-related risks in 2020, BlackRock declared that its operations were carbon neutral. But that metric included Scope 3 emissions only where the firm deemed them “appropriate,” such as employee business travel. The company did not factor in the more than $250 billion in fossil fuel investments included in BlackRock’s portfolio.

This spring, BlackRock projected that by 2030, three-quarters of its managed assets would be invested in companies with net-zero emissions targets. But not only did the firm omit a binding pledge to hit that target, it also failed to specify the criteria that would make such investments “net-zero aligned.”

“If BlackRock doesn’t disclose the concrete and timebound requests made to companies, this announcement is another smokescreen,” said Lara Cuvelier, sustainable investment manager for the French non-profit Reclaim Finance, in a statement responding to the announcement. “The world’s largest asset manager cannot get away with vaguely defined commitments.”

A Material World

The SEC’s proposed rule would establish special reporting requirements for companies that have set public climate targets, potentially making it harder for firms like BlackRock and the companies it invests in to conceal a stay-the-course climate strategy from investors and the broader public. All companies would also be required to disclose some Scope 3 emissions.

While backing the rule, climate advocates are urging the commission to require disclosure of all Scope 3 emissions, not just those that a company deems “material” — an accounting term of art referring to information that could impact decision-making by investors. Existing SEC guidance already clarifies that companies should disclose any material climate-related risks, but that standard has failed to produce any significant change in reporting, according to the Government Accountability Office.

“Management has incentive not to disclose risk,” said Yevgeny Shrago, climate policy director for Public Citizen, one of the groups that weighed in on the rulemaking. “When you ask whether something’s ‘material,’ that means it’s in management’s discretion what they choose to disclose.”

Climate advocates are also calling for more rigorous auditing requirements for Scope 3 emissions.

State and congressional Republicans are pushing in the opposite direction, using the complexity and cost of expansive emissions accounting as their central line of attack in round after round of bills, comment letters, and public statements.

“The Mandatory Materiality Requirement Act,” introduced this month by Reps. Bill Huizenga (R-Mich.) and Andy Barr (R-Ky.), would restrict the SEC’s ability to impose more rigorous disclosure requirements. Another bill introduced this summer would directly prohibit the SEC from requiring Scope 3 emissions disclosures.

This fall, a group of corporate Democrats including Kyrsten Sinema (Ariz.) and Jon Tester (Mont.) also urged the SEC to slow the pace of rulemaking in a letter reported by Politico.

The final SEC rule is also almost certain to face legal challenges from Republicans and business lobbies.

BlackRock’s Climate Gambit

A subtler form of opposition to the SEC rule is coming from another quarter: investment firms, most prominently BlackRock. These companies say they support a new disclosure rule but are quietly fighting its key provisions.

In June comments submitted to the agency, BlackRock began by applauding the “goal of implementing a framework for public issuers to provide investors with more comparable and consistent climate-related disclosures.”

But the firm’s comments then recommend substantial changes, including expanding a proposed “safe harbor” that would shield companies from liability for inaccurate or incomplete emissions disclosures. BlackRock also advocated for a “comply or explain” approach “which allows issuers to either disclose material Scope 3 emissions or explain why certain emissions categories are not relevant to the issuer or not subject to reasonable estimation.”

While acknowledging the importance of assessing Scope 3 emissions, BlackRock’s comments assert that the methodologies for measuring them are currently limited and still evolving, and that “with the broader adoption of reporting standards, datasets, and methodologies, they will improve meaningfully further.”

Public Citizen’s Shrago argues that requiring large companies to begin producing reasonable estimates of their emissions is precisely what will accelerate that improvement. “[Measuring Scope 3 emissions] will only get easier and cheaper with a rule requiring all companies to do it,” he said. “The challenge right now is that there just isn’t standardized data.”

BlackRock also suggests that the final SEC rule should be aligned with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Disclosures (TCFD) — an industry-led group of which BlackRock is a member. The TCFD framework, which BlackRock uses in its own climate risk reporting, recommends disclosing Scope 3 emissions “where appropriate.”

Groups like the TCFD are part of a “climate finance echo chamber” that BlackRock has helped create and fund, according to a 2021 report from Reclaim Finance. The report raised the alarm about BlackRock’s outsized role in writing the European Union’s new sustainable finance strategy and urged regulators to write their own rules rather than relying on those the industry has written for itself.

At the same time, BlackRock is pushing to narrow a separate SEC rule combating greenwashing in ESG funds, which account for more than $500 billion of assets managed by the firm.

In addition to submitting comments and meeting with SEC Chair Gary Gensler this summer, BlackRock officials met twice with Republican SEC commissioners in November. One of those commissioners, Donald Trump appointee Hester Peirce, issued a statement opposing the disclosure rule this spring.

Summary Companies To leave BlackRock in April after two years

Will join $10 billion Bezos Earth Fund

Bodnar was previously global head of sustainable investing















LONDON, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Paul Bodnar, the head of sustainability policy and engagement at BlackRock (BLK.N), the world's biggest asset manager, is to join tech mogul Jeff Bezos' $10 billion Bezos Earth Fund, a memo to staff on Friday reviewed by Reuters shows.

The April move will mark the end of a two-year stint at the company for Bodnar, who was previously global head of BlackRock Sustainable Investing. He took up his most recent role during a reorganisation of BlackRock's sustainability efforts in October.

It follows a tough time for the company as it faces pressure from campaigners to push for faster climate action by companies, and concern from some U.S. politicians that doing so could impact investor returns.

The memo said BlackRock assets invested through its dedicated sustainable investing platform now stood at around $500 billion of its total of roughly $8.6 trillion in assets, and Bodnar had been ""central to that success"".

""Paul approached us recently with a plan to return to his career path in the impact world, and today it will be announced that he will be joining the Bezos Earth Fund to oversee programs that involve collaboration among financial services, the real economy and governments,"" the memo said.

Feb 16 (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) President Robert Kapito's remarks during a financial conference on Thursday were interrupted several times by questions on the company's climate change responsibilities.

Kapito was talking about bonds at the Bank of America Securities Financial Services Conference in New York when someone at the event shouted questions about BlackRock’s responsibility to exit investments in fossil fuels.

The panel moderator, Craig Siegenthaler, managing director at BofA Global Research, asked to call security and Kapito said he would respond ""at the appropriate time, not interrupting the event"".

The live webcast from BlackRock's website switched to playing music. This happened twice more over the next few minutes. It was not immediately clear who was interrupting the event.

Climate activists have targeted BlackRock for years, asking the world’s largest asset manager to stop investing in fossil fuel companies, or to push them harder to cut emissions.

BlackRock has rejected the idea of divesting from fossil fuels, saying instead it wants to engage with companies on the transition to a low-carbon economy.

BlackRock has projected that by 2030 at least three quarters of its investments in companies and governments will be with issuers that have scientific targets to cut net greenhouse gas emissions.

It says its role as a fiduciary to clients ""is to help them navigate investment risks and opportunities, not to engineer a specific decarbonization outcome in the real economy,"" according to a statement on its website.

The stance has drawn criticism from many sides in the debate, with environmentalists protesting it does too little to press for change at oil, gas and coal companies in its portfolio even as Republican U.S. politicians from energy-producing states accuse it of boycotting that industry.

The top financial officer of Florida said Thursday he would bar BlackRock, a major Wall Street investment firm, from managing about $2 billion of state treasury funds because of what he called a “campaign to change the world” with company policies mindful of the environment and other concerns. Want to know how your actions can help make a difference for our planet? Sign up for the Climate Coach newsletter, in your inbox every Tuesday and Thursday. ArrowRight In targeting BlackRock, the state chief financial officer, Jimmy Patronis, said it is “undemocratic of major asset managers to use their power to influence societal outcomes.”

Headed by chief executive Larry Fink, BlackRock and other investment firms have increasingly used their client shares as clout to pressure companies into following ESG standards, short for “environmental, social and governance” policies.

It has questioned investments in sectors such as fossil fuels, a divestiture that many experts say not only benefits the climate but also is a smart investment strategy.

But nationwide, many Republican state treasurers and attorneys general have organized themselves to rebuff such ESG policies. Patronis, a Republican, is the latest.

“If Larry, or his friends on Wall Street, want to change the world, run for office. Start a nonprofit. Donate to the causes you care about,” Patronis said in a statement, citing comments from Fink about using shareholder stakes to influence corporate behavior. “Using our cash, however, to fund” a social-engineering project from BlackRock is not “something Florida ever signed up for,” he added.

Patronis also sits on the nearly $218 billion Florida State Board of Administration along with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) and Attorney General Ashley Moody (R), but for now there was no change in policy at the giant pension fund. He said at the state treasury BlackRock had managed $1.4 billion of long-duration funds and $600 million devoted to short-term cash activities.

The move against BlackRock follows efforts in states such as Missouri, Louisiana and Texas to derail ESG corporate standards and cudgel Democrats over their use.

At an August meeting of the Florida Cabinet, trustees unanimously adopted a resolution restricting the use of ESG factors in making investment decisions in the Florida Retirement System Defined Benefit Plan. The new House of Representatives, led by Republicans, plans to call executives from major financial institutions to appear at what promise to be contentious oversight committee hearings.

The politicization of the issue frustrates many fund managers, because climate change has been shown to expose companies to various risks, ranging from direct effects of extreme weather to market fluctuations. Investors themselves are also making demands.

“Most investors are saying that, in addition to getting financial returns, they want their money used in ways they are not embarrassed by,” said Joshua Gotbaum, an investment banker who has served in five administrations from both parties, including a stint as head of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.

“Unfortunately, part of what is going on is that politicians who do not want to admit that there is climate change would like to say that taking environmental and social factors into account is somehow inappropriate,” he added.

The ouster of BlackRock will have little immediate impact. The firm worldwide was managing nearly $8 trillion at the end of September.

BlackRock corporate communications director Christopher Van Es said the asset management firm acted “with the sole goal of driving returns for our clients.” He cited the “strong returns BlackRock has delivered to Florida taxpayers over the past five years.”

“We are disturbed by the emerging trend of political initiatives like this that sacrifice access to high-quality investments and thereby jeopardize returns, which will ultimately hurt Florida’s citizens,” Van Es said.

He also said that long-term investment flows into BlackRock had reached $84 billion in the third quarter of this year and $275 billion over the last 12 months. Other major asset managers include Vanguard and State Street.

It’s hard because it’s not business any more, they’re doing it in a personal way. And for the first time in my professional career, attacks are now personal. They’re trying to demonize the issues.’”

That’s fund giant BlackRock Inc.’s BLK, -1.17% Chief Executive Larry Fink’s answer when asked this week at the glitzy Switzerland gathering of executives, economists and politicians about the “anti-woke” pushback against Wall Streeters who see investment opportunity in fighting climate change.

Fink said the contrarian narrative around environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing has become ugly and is creating “huge polarization.” ESG can span issues like gender diversity on boards or executive compensation, but tends to be readily swapped for climate-focused and alternative-energy investing themes, especially as more companies are pressured to report fossil-fuel emissions or consider increasingly popular fuels like solar ICLN, -0.33% or hydrogen instead of oil CL00, +0.19% and gas.

Attention on the topic has also gained detractors who suggest any ESG focus dilutes a “neutral” fiduciary obligation that favors returns over other considerations by fund managers and other stakeholders.

“Let’s be clear, the narrative is ugly, the narrative is creating this huge polarization. If you really read the CEO letters that I’ve written in the past I talk about a transition” to new forms of energy or addressing fresh demand from younger investors who care about social issues, Fink said in an interview with Bloomberg TV at the World Economic Forum in Davos.

Fink famously dedicated a “materially different” 2020 annual letter to shareholders and executives on sustainable investments, which he called the “investment opportunity” of his lifetime and one that will deliver better returns over time.

But this narrative path has not been without its pitfalls.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a likely 2024 Republican presidential candidate, this week moved to prohibit state-run fund managers from taking ESG factors, a into consideration when making investments. Last year, Florida said it moved $2 billion in taxpayer assets from accounts with BlackRock because of ESG.

“Corporations across America continue to inject an ideological agenda through our economy rather than through the ballot box. Today’s actions reinforce that ESG considerations will not be tolerated here in Florida, and I look forward to extending these protections during this legislative session,” DeSantis said in a release.

In a speech, he cranked up the rhetoric, saying his state would “never surrender to the ‘woke’ mob” and that “Florida is where ‘woke’ goes to die.”

A Department of Labor ruling last year removed penalties on retirement-fund and 401(k) managers who consider ESG themes, although maintained that client goals and economic conditions must be given priority.

Texas and select other states have made similar anti-ESG vows. And BlackRock has felt compelled to respond, at least in some fashion. The asset manager, the world’s largest as it topped $10 trillion under its watch, channeled record sums into U.S. political campaigns last year, including an advertising campaign to explain its business focus managing money for retirees. It also brought on additional lobbyists in Texas and on Capitol Hill.

BlackRock said last year that by 2030, it anticipates that at least 75% of its corporate and sovereign assets managed on behalf of clients will be invested in stock and bond issuers with science-based emissions targets. That would be up from 25% currently.

Its rivals, such as Vanguard, have also faced backlash. Vanguard relinquished its membership in a net-zero emissions pact.

BlackRock’s assets under management, which had crossed the $10 trillion threshold in 2021, stood at $8.59 trillion at the end of December despite inflows into its funds during the fourth quarter. The assent manager lost $4 billion in business over ESG bans in 2022, it said, but noted the firm took in $230 billion in new business from U.S. clients over the same period.

High-profile naysayers aren’t making Fink’s initiatives any easier.

In tracking news out of Davos, onetime energy-sector operative and California gubernatorial candidate Michael Shellenberger called out the WEF’s own attention on ESG, to which Tesla TSLA, -1.06% founder Elon Musk offered a colorful response.

Musk, whose electric-vehicle maker Tesla, earned critical ESG marks alleging lack of transparency has called the label a “scam.”

Fink, meanwhile, has also been called out by environmental groups for not dumping traditional energy fast enough.

“We are doing everything we can to change the narrative,” Fink told Bloomberg in the Davos interview, adding that he plans to write a letter to business leaders this quarter that will focus on the “concept of hope.”

Oct 25 (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) has raised $4.5 billion out of an overall $7.5 billion-target for a new fund to invest in infrastructure assets aimed at climate-focused projects, the world's largest asset manager said on Tuesday.

BlackRock, which manages around $8 trillion in assets, said public and private pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, insurance companies and family offices had invested in the new fund, which will be called Global Infrastructure Fund IV.

The asset manager said the new fund will invest in five sectors –– energy, low carbon power, transport and logistics, regulated utilities, and digital infrastructure –– to capitalize on the growing trend towards decarbonization and digitalization.

Its previous infrastructure fund raised $5.1 billion in 2020.

Earlier this month, BlackRock Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink defended his firm's energy investments after facing a backlash from lawmakers critical of its stance on environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues.

BlackRock has faced criticism from many sides in the debate on low-carbon fuels, with environmentalists protesting it does too little to press for change at fossil fuel portfolio companies, and Republican U.S. politicians accusing it of boycotting energy stocks.

The company also recently set up a unit called Transition Capital to invest in opportunities linked to the global shift to a low-carbon economy.

Summary Companies To help countries, companies in low-carbon shift

Group to be led by former McKinsey exec Dickon Pinner

To work across asset classes, geographies















LONDON, Oct 17 (Reuters) - BlackRock (BLK.N), the world's biggest asset manager, has set up a unit called Transition Capital to invest in opportunities linked to the global shift to a low-carbon economy, a memo to staff seen by Reuters showed.

BlackRock, which manages around $8 trillion in assets, said Transition Capital would work with portfolio managers and BlackRock's capital markets team to find and back ""proprietary transition-focused opportunities"" across asset classes and geographies.

The group would also work with BlackRock colleagues to develop new investment strategies and funds, and help deepen the company's research in the area, the memo said.

""Our dialogue with clients, CEOs of established and startup companies, and government leaders tells us that they are all looking for even more ways to work directly with BlackRock,"" the memo said.

""They are looking for a trusted partner who can provide the patient and flexible sources of capital to transform their portfolios, businesses, industries, and countries. Our aim is to be the clear global leader.""

The move comes ahead of the next round of global climate talks in Egypt in November, and as policymakers and regulators increasingly push companies and investors to speed up their efforts.

It follows a tough period for BlackRock as its position on climate change has drawn criticism from some right-leaning politicians that it was effectively boycotting fossil fuels, cause of the bulk of man-made greenhouse gas emissions.

At the same time, though, it has also faced criticism from campaigners for not using its position to greater effect by cutting back finance to heavy emitting sectors and helping accelerate change in the real economy.

The new unit will be part of BlackRock Alternatives and run by Dickon Pinner, who previously led on sustainability at consultant McKinsey, where he advised on the transition, the memo said.

Pinner also worked on clean technologies whilst at McKinsey and has experience in the oil and gas industry as a reservoir engineer, the memo said.

Pinner will report jointly to Edwin Conway, Global Head of BlackRock Alternative Investors, and the company's vice-chair, Philipp Hildebrand.

As well as joining the BlackRock Alternatives Executive Committee, Pinner will also sit on senior sustainability committees, the memo said.

In doing so it managed to avoid testifying before a Texas Senate Committee today (Dec. 15), and set itself apart from BlackRock, which has continued to resist pressure from Republicans to drop ESG commitments.

The asset manager’s decision to quit NZAM—which still counts BlackRock and State Street as members—marked a major step away from climate-finance commitments as Republicans intensify pressure on asset managers to re-evaluate their ESG strategies. Though Republicans leading this pressure campaign say they’re concerned taking ESG into account endangers the energy industry and does a disservice to shareholders, critics say the backlash is a politically-motivated move to protect oil and gas companies.

Vanguard quit climate alliance to provide ‘clarity’ to investors

Executives from BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street were all scheduled to answer questions from a Texas Senate committee today about their ESG policies. “Texans deserve to know” how ESG may affect their pension funds, Bryan Hughes, a Republican state senator and chairman of the committee, tweeted.

But Vanguard’s decision to pull out of NZAM appeared to mollify lawmakers, prompting them to excuse the asset manager from appearing at the hearing. In a Dec. 14 letter Hughes said the committee was “encouraged” that Vanguard withdrew from NZAM, but added they would continue to evaluate the asset manager’s ESG practices.

Today the Senate Committee on State Affairs sent a letter to Vanguard excusing them from appearing before the committee at tomorrow’s hearing.

We look forward to discussing the harmful effects that ESG policies have on Texas retirees with Black Rock and State Street.#txlege pic.twitter.com/uOfSSGyMF6 — Senator Bryan Hughes (@SenBryanHughes) December 14, 2022

Vanguard, which joined NZAM last year, said in a Dec. 7 statement it had decided to quit the alliance “after a considerable period of review.”

Initiatives like NZAM “can advance constructive dialogue, but sometimes they can also result in confusion about the views of individual investment firms,” Vanguard said. The firm added it was withdrawing “so that we can provide the clarity our investors desire about the role of index funds,” and to make clear Vanguard “speaks independently” on matters pertinent to investors.

Former vice president Al Gore called Vanguard’s decision “irresponsible,” while Brad Lander, the New York City comptroller, said on Twitter it constituted a “cowardly walkback.”

In a way, Vanguard’s decision is a more honest approach, given 80 percent of its investments are passively managed index funds, said Ken Pucker, a senior lecturer at Tufts University. “They’re not addressing climate change. They’re trying to minimize fees and maximize returns,” he said. “They’re saying, essentially, ‘we’re not about planetary welfare, we’re about optimizing returns.’”

BlackRock stands by ESG commitments

Thus far BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has resisted calls from Republicans to stop factoring climate and social concerns into its investment decisions.

In recent years BlackRock has positioned itself as an industry leader in ESG investing as demand for funds that take these factors into account has soared. But ESG funds like the ones sold by BlackRock have little bearing on climate change, a 2021 Bloomberg investigation found. The ESG rating company BlackRock uses doesn’t take into account a firm’s impact on climate change, but rather the effect of climate risks on their bottom line. Still, that hasn’t stopped states from pledging to pull more than $3 billion collectively from the asset manager in recent months.

BlackRock continues to invest in fossil fuel and has cited more than $100 billion worth of investments in Texas energy companies as proof of that. In June BlackRock CEO Larry Fink told Bloomberg he didn’t want to be the “environmental police,” and said it was wrong to ask the private sector to protect the environment through their work.",Vanguard Splits From BlackRock Over Major Climate Alliance as the Backlash to ESG Builds

The letters come as political pressure mounts against the idea of environmental, social and governance (ESG) funds, which purport to give people an easy way to invest in companies acting responsibly in those areas. Critics, particularly on the Republican side, have said ESG is a cover for a political agenda and is partly aimed against fossil fuel producers.

Bloomberg, who is currently worth almost $77 billion according to Forbes, published an op-ed in his namesake media publication on Tuesday deriding the Republican-led efforts to politicize investment decisions in climate solutions and clean energy.

""In a world rapidly moving to clean energy, companies that are dependent on fossil fuels put investors at greater risk,"" Bloomberg wrote.

""The fact is: Climate risk is financial risk. Costs from climate-related weather events now exceed $100 billion annually — and that is only counting insured losses,"" Bloomberg wrote. ""Accounting for these and other losses isn't social policy. It's smart investing. And refusing to allow firms to do it comes with a big cost to taxpayers.""

On Wednesday, BlackRock sent a letter to a collection of attorney generals which defended its engagement in measuring the climate risk of companies and investing in clean energy as responsibly carrying out its fiduciary duty to clients.

""Our commitment to our clients' financial interests is unwavering and undivided,"" wrote BlackRock's senior managing director and head of external affairs, Dalia Blass.

""Governments representing over 90 percent of global GDP have committed to move to net-zero in the coming decades.

NAIROBI, March 14 (Reuters) - Climate Finance Partnership, a fund managed by BlackRock Alternatives, is buying nearly a third of the shares in Kenyan wind farm Lake Turkana, it said on Tuesday.

Climate-focused funds are increasingly training their sights on Africa, which offers growing demand for clean energy and other climate infrastructure.

The continent is also suffering from the ravages of climate change-driven events like drought. Kenya and neighbours Ethiopia and Somalia are going through the worst drought in decades, which has caused starvation among millions.

BlackRock said the fund will acquire the stake in Lake Turkana Wind Power in Kenya's far north from Finnish development financier Finnfund, Danish wind turbines maker Vestas (VWS.CO), and the Investment Fund for Developing Countries, a Danish development financier.

A regulatory filing published in the Kenyan press on Tuesday said the stake amounts to 31.25% of the shares of LTWP, a 365-wind turbine facility with a 310 megawatt capacity.

The regulatory notice defined the stake as ""controlling"", but BlackRock later said that was within the meaning of Kenya's energy law, not in the conventional sense of a controlling or majority stake. It did not disclose the value of the deal.

""The LTWP project provides reliable, low-cost energy to Kenya's national grid via a 20-year power purchase agreement with Kenya Power,"" BlackRock said, referring to the East African nation's power distribution company.

LTWP provides just over a tenth of Kenya's power generation, offering electricity to more than 3 million people, BlackRock said.

The deal, which requires regulatory approval, represents a first private investment in Africa for BlackRock Alternatives, part of BlackRock Inc (BLK.N), it said.

The Climate Finance Partnership (CFP) is a public-private fund that targets emerging market climate infrastructure, bringing together BlackRock, the French, German and Japanese governments, and some U.S.-based organisations.

It has commitments of $637 million from a range of global investors, which exceeded its fundraising target of $500 million.

""The fund plans to invest at least 25% of its assets under management in Africa,"" it said.

Cotton Demands Answers from BlackRock About Involvement with Climate Action 100+, Potential Antitrust Violations

Washington, D.C. — Senator Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas) last night sent a letter to Larry Fink, Chairman and CEO of BlackRock Inc., demanding answers about the firm’s involvement in a scheme to reduce drilling for oil and gas that may violate antitrust law.

In part, Cotton wrote, “BlackRock is an ‘investor participant’ in Climate Action 100+ (‘CA100+’), ‘an investor-led initiative’ to pressure ‘the world’s largest corporate greenhouse gas emitters [to] take necessary action on climate change’ like, for example, pressuring oil companies to drill for less oil. According to CA100+, ‘investor participants’ are ‘signatories to the initiative and are responsible for direct engagements with focus companies’ that directly compete with one another.”

“Your anti-drilling coercion threatens our national security, hurts Americans struggling to buy a tank of gas, and appears to violate antitrust laws. Specifically, by engaging with competing ‘focus companies,’ CA100+ investor participants appear to be running a spoke-and-hub conspiracy to restrict the supply of fossil fuels and impose various other unlawful restraints on trade. By ‘collaborating’ with other investors, you and your fellow CA100+ investor participants appear to be acting like a climate cartel,” Cotton continued.

Text of the letter may be found here and below.

Dear Mr. Fink,

I'm writing about your involvement in a scheme to reduce drilling for oil and gas.

BlackRock is an ""investor participant"" in Climate Action 100+ (""CA100+""), ""an investor-led initiative"" to pressure ""the world's largest corporate greenhouse gas emitters [to] take necessary action on climate change"" like, for example, pressuring oil companies to drill for less oil. According to CA100+, ""investor participants"" are ""signatories to the initiative and are responsible for direct engagements with focus companies"" that directly compete with one another.

Your anti-drilling coercion threatens our national security, hurts Americans struggling to buy a tank of gas, and appears to violate antitrust laws.

By ""collaborating"" with other investors, you and your fellow CA100+ investor participants appear to be acting like a climate cartel.

In light of the growing concerns about anti-competitive ESG activities, many law firms have begun offering antitrust counsel to clients participating in initiatives like CA100+.

Please provide answers to the following questions by July 20, 2022:

Has BlackRock engaged with any focus companies as part of the CA100+ initiative? If so, please list each focus company. Has BlackRock collaborated with any other investor participants as part of the CA100+ initiative? If so, please list each investor participant.

BlackRock, Vanguard, State Street and Fidelity are among the dozens of asset managers receiving low grades in ShareAction’s latest analysis of ESG practices in the sector, published today (26 February).

The analysis, entitled ‘The Point of No Returns’, ranks asset managers on their governance and stewardship, as well as the strength of their policies and extent of their impact on climate change, biodiversity and society.

It paints a picture of weak progress across the board. Two-thirds of the 77 companies covered, collectively managing $60trn in assets, have “serious gaps in their responsible investment policies and practices” for at least one of these areas.

“A majority of the world’s largest asset managers are failing to meet even basic criteria, let alone take the steps needed to help protect people and planet for generations to come,” ShareAction’s head of financial sector research Claudia Gray said.

“The impact of the decisions these asset managers make cannot be understated. As managers of tens of trillions of dollars, and investors in the biggest companies from many industries, their decisions have a vast impact all over the world. They should be considering their effects on our climate, the ecosystems providing our life-support systems, and human wellbeing worldwide. These problems create real risks for the big companies and their investors, but as our research has uncovered, there remains a lack of ambition to drive real-world improvements.”

The weakest area overall was biodiversity, with even some of the top-rated companies receiving a weak score here. ShareAction is urging asset managers to get ahead of the curve and implement stronger policies on forests, rivers and oceans. It notes that voluntary biodiversity standards are being developed at a pace and that nations will soon update their own plans, after a new UN Treaty was ratified late last year. The finance sector will be crucial to delivering its commitments to halt and reverse nature loss.

Also of concern is the fact that some of the world’s largest asset managers received poor grades on multiple ESG issues. The so-called ‘big four’, BlackRock, Vanguard, State Street and Fidelity Investments, all received an overall grade of ‘CCC’ or lower.

Vanguard received an ‘E’ grade, with ShareAction rating it particularly poorly on climate and biodiversity. These were also the weak spots for BlackRock, which received a ‘D’ grade overall.

State Street also took a ‘D’ grade, with governance being its weakest area. Fidelity Investments’ overall grade was ‘E’, and its weakest area was social impact.

Other companies receiving low grades include Morgan Stanley, Allianz, Credit Suisse and Samsung Asset Management, the latter of which was the lowest-ranked of all 77 firms assessed.

ShareAction has stated that there is a “huge” difference between ESG performance based on where asset managers are based. It raps asset managers based in North America and the Asia-pacific regions for lagging behind their European counterparts and notes that firms in these geographies often failed to provide even basic ESG information. US managers received the worst grades more than three times as frequently as their European rivals.

A BlackRock spokesperson said the firm questions ShareAction’s methodology. They said: “The premise of the report does not take into account the fact that our clients invest with BlackRock in pursuit of their long-term financial goals and that, as stewards of their assets, our role is to help them achieve these goals.”

‘Green shoots’

Despite poor performance overall, ShareAction has noted some “surprising and inspiring green shoots of progress”, in the form of significant improvements from some asset managers and continued leadership from others.

The four top-ranked asset managers are Robeco, BNP Paribas, Aviva and Legal and General. Robeco and BNP Paribas also topped the rankings at ShareAction’s late edition, in 2020.

Elsewhere, SEB Asset Management climbed a significant 51 places, improving its climate and biodiversity targets as well as its stewardship. Santander Asset Management similarly climbed 44 places, with ShareAction noting the adoption of stronger climate targets. The biggest climber was JP Morgan Asset Management, which was ranked 58 places higher than in the 2020 edition – also largely due to movements on climate.

ShareAction has stated that these examples “show that investing can be both responsible and profitable, even for those managers of a considerable size”.

Nonetheless, BNP Paribas is set for a court case over its climate impact – specifically, its financing of oil and gas. A coalition of NGOs including Oxfam and Friends of the Earth gave BNP Paribas notice last November, stating that it is failing to meet its due diligence obligations over its continues support for fossil fuel expansion. It was confirmed this week that the Paris Judicial Court will hear the case.

BNP Paribas has said it is “regrettable” that the NGOs had not engaged in more dialogue before taking legal action. It has stated that most major asset managers are “long-standing financiers of energy production” and that more than half of its financing in this field is now low-carbon, compared with 5% 10 years ago.

BlackRock , the largest asset manager in the world, said it will likely vote to support fewer climate proposals from companies in its investment portfolio in 2022 than it did in 2021 because those climate proposals coming up for a vote this year are more exacting and demanding than in previous years.

On Tuesday, BlackRock's Investment Stewardship team published a preview of how it's going to vote in the current season of company shareholding meetings. Blackrock's Investment Stewardship (BIS) is a team of financial professionals that liaises between corporate governance of the companies it invests in for the benefit of its clients.

In 2021, BlackRock voted in favor of 47% of environmental and social shareholder proposals (81 of 172), the BIS said in its note.

In the current season, BlackRock is ""likely to support proportionately fewer this proxy season than in 2021, as we do not consider them to be consistent with our clients' long-term financial interests,"" the BIS note says.

BlackRock will not vote for company changes that ""implicitly are intended to micromanage companies,"" BIS said. ""This includes those that are unduly prescriptive and constraining on the decision-making of the board or management, call for changes to a company's strategy or business model, or address matters that are not material to how a company delivers long-term shareholder value.""

Instead, BlackRock will favor measures which improve a company's disclosure of information that help investors understand how well a company is positioned to adapt to climate-related changes. BlackRock wants to see specific ""quantitative"" information about a company's scope 1 and 2 emissions and a company's emissions reductions plans.",Blackrock to vote for fewer climate shareholder provisions in 2022 than 2021

The chief investment officers of United Kingdom-based Bluebell Capital Partners accused CEO Larry Fink on Tuesday of repeatedly failing to live up to his stated sustainability commitments.

BlackRock’s combination of increased rhetoric around sustainability with continued funding of fossil fuels like coal created a worst-of-all-worlds situation for sustainable investing, Bluebell chief investment officers Giuseppe Bivona and Marco Taricco wrote.

In its letter published on Tuesday, Bluebell is concerned about “the gap between what BlackRock consistently says on ESG and what they actually do,” Bivona told CNBC, referring to environment, social and governance-focused (ESG) investing.

“We see BlackRock endorsing a number of bad practices from a governance, social and environmental perspective which is not actually in tune with what they say,” Bivona added.

The letter comes amid a widespread reaction from U.S. Republicans against ESG investing in general and BlackRock in particular.

Florida just followed Texas, Missouri and Louisiana in pulling billions of dollars in state assets from management by BlackRock.

In a January letter to investors, Fink defended the company against accusations by conservatives that BlackRock was using its economic power for political ends — arguing that sustainability was good business.

But Fink also defended BlackRock’s continued investment in climate-harming fossil fuel companies. In the January letter, he wrote at length about the importance of remaining invested in problematic companies as a means of maintaining influence over their activities — which would be lost under divestment.

“Divesting from entire sectors — or simply passing carbon-intensive assets from public markets to private markets — will not get the world to net zero,” Fink wrote.

As conservative attacks on ESG heated up, BlackRock released a fact sheet boasting its investment of $170 billion in U.S. public energy companies, ”including pipelines and power generation facilities.”

This sort of careful tightrope-walking has meant “reputational risk (including greenwashing risk) to which BlackRock under the leadership of Larry Fink have unreasonably exposed the company,” Bivona and Taricco wrote the company in a now-public November letter.

“The contradictions and apparent hypocrisy of BlackRock’s actions have . . . politicized the ESG debate,” Bivona and Taricco wrote.

“The reputational damage of being dragged into this politically charged debate, in our view, is very significant because it calls into question the independence of BlackRock as an asset manager.”

While BlackRock is the largest member of the Net Zero Asset Manager Initiative, it is still a major investor in coal, oil and gas, according to an April report from Reclaim Finance.

BlackRock holds $133 billion in oil and gas investments, Reclaim reported.

And along with large asset manager Vanguard, BlackRock also holds $60 billion in coal, per Reclaim.

In particular, BlackRock’s continued investment in Glencore — the world’s 11th largest coal producer — shows why “BlackRock most embodies the hypocrisy of too many asset managers,” Lara Cuvelier of Reclaim Finance said in a statement at the time.

BlackRock’s framing of the fossil fuel debate as “divestment versus engagement,” was overly simplistic, according to Reclaim.

“Pitting engagement and exclusion as diametrically opposing practices is at best misguided and at worst a deliberate strategy to avoid exclusion,” the report wrote.

“In fact, the most effective investors use exclusion and divestment and the threat of future divestment as a cudgel to enhance their engagement efforts,” Reclaim added.

Members of “engagement-first” groups like the Net Zero Asset Manager Initiative voted against almost a third of environmental resolutions at the companies they invested in, according to a 2021 study by activist group ShareAction.

One particular example helped lead for Bluebell’s current call for Fink’s ouster.

In April, BlackRock’s refusal to back sustainability proposals that Bluebell — which has a 0.01 percent stake in the asset manager — called for at companies like the mining giant Glencore, according to the Financial Times.

Specifically, BlackRock refused to support Bluebell’s February shareholder resolution that sought to force Glencore to spin off its thermal coal business, which produces coal for power plants.

“Due to its coal business, Glencore is not an investible company for investors who place sustainability at the heart of their investment process,” Taricco and Bivona wrote in 2021, according to Bloomberg.

“A clear separation between carbonized and de-carbonized assets is needed to increase shareholder value and remove the ‘coal discount’, whilst simultaneously ensuring that coal assets will be managed responsibly.”

While Fink has often warned of the dangers of divestment, this was not a principled stance, Bivona told CNBC.

“Let me say that when the price of coal was around $76 per ton, BlackRock was talking about essentially divesting,” he said.

“Now that the price of coal is $380 per ton, they are talking about responsible ownership. I think there is a high correlation between BlackRock’s strategy on coal and the price of coal,” Bivona added.

BlackRock pushed back — albeit in a manner that essentially agreed with Bluebell’s description of their vote as primarily financial.

“In the past 18 months, Bluebell has waged a number of campaigns to promote their climate and governance agenda. BlackRock Investment Stewardship did not support their campaigns as we did not consider them to be in the best economic interests of our clients,” BlackRock representatives wrote in a statement.

But Bluebell has managed to make big waves at other companies where it had only a relatively small investment, the Financial Times reported.

The activist investors successfully deposed the chief executive at Danone last year, according to Financial Times.","Activist investors blast BlackRock’s ‘hypocrisy’ on sustainability, call for CEO ouster"

Please register now if you would like to attend.

BlackRock has announced an enhancement to the sustainability credentials of its Europe-listed ‘ESG-Screened’ ETFs including additional business activity screening and the adoption of overall carbon reduction targets.

BlackRock offers six ETFs within its ESG-Screened suite with funds targeting stocks from global developed, US, European, eurozone, Japanese, and emerging market universes.

Collectively, the suite houses $15 billion in assets under management while the individual funds are priced with total expense ratios (TERs) ranging between 0.07% and 0.20%.

The ETFs are linked to ‘ESG Screened’ indices from MSCI that are based on the index provider’s flagship benchmarks for large and mid-cap equity performance in the target markets.

The methodology currently excludes violators of UN Global Compact principles, companies that are associated with controversial, civilian, and nuclear weapons, or tobacco, and firms that derive significant revenue from thermal coal or oil sands extraction.

The constituents that remain after these exclusionary screens are weighted by float-adjusted market capitalization.

From 1 March, MSCI will adopt additional rules for the methodology which include removing companies embroiled in severe ESG-related controversies and firms deriving more than 5% of their revenue from palm oil or arctic oil & gas.

Each index will also now target a 30% reduction in total carbon intensity (based on Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions) relative to its parent universe. Unlike most Paris-aligned benchmarks (PAB), however, the indices will not utilize an optimization weighting process to achieve their lower carbon profile. Instead, the indices will maintain their float-adjusted market capitalization weights and will remove the companies with the largest carbon emissions until the target is met.

Each ETF is expected to maintain its classification as an Article 8 product under the European Union’s Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR).

Mehta will run the BlackRock Global Markets Group, overseeing trading, lending and other functions around the firm's relationship with Wall Street. Mr. Mehta stepped into the human resources role in a moment of crisis for the department when an earlier HR chief was fired for violating company policy following an office romance.

Wednesday's changes come at a pivotal time for BlackRock, which remains in political crossfire over its sustainability-minded investment products. Republican lawmakers and governors have retaliated against ESG efforts, and Democratic leaders and pundits have chastised the $8 trillion asset manager for holding large stakes in companies that pollute and manufacture guns.

""The actions we announced today and in October will deepen our connections with clients, further strengthen our investment platform and promote BlackRock's next generation of leaders,"" Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink and President Rob Kapito wrote in the memo.

Joud Abdel Majeid, previously deputy chief financial officer, will succeed Ms. Boss as head of investment stewardship, a position that's increasingly visible as sustainability issues foment in Washington.

In other changes to the client group, Armando Senra will take over BlackRock's institutional business in the Americas. Dominik Rohe will replace Mr. Senra as head of the Americas iShares and index business.

BlackRock also altered its global executive committee.

Several women were added to the senior group. Ms. Majeid and Caroline Heller, who's replacing Mr. Mehta atop the human resources department, will both join the group, along with deputy head of Asia-Pacific Susan Chan, and chief investment officer of ETF & index investments Samara Cohen. Two senior investment officials, Rick Rieder and Raffaele Savi, will also join.

Some leaders will step away from the global executive committee — potentially pointing to changes to who's in the running to succeed Fink, 70, in the event of his retirement.

Climate activists have gathered inside the headquarters of financial investment firm BlackRock to protest the company’s investment in fossil fuels.

This is the third straight day of climate protests in New York City, led by activist groups like New York Communities for Change (NYCC) and the New York chapters of the Sunrise Movement and Extinction Rebellion.

Video shows activists sitting down in front of escalators in the building holding banners that read things like “How dare you plunder the Earth?” and “Your greed = climate chaos.”

The activists say that they’ve spread coal on the floor in front of the sit-in.

BlackRock, the world’s largest investment firm, has trillions of dollars in assets across many different companies, including fossil fuel companies. The Independent has contacted a representative for the firm for comment.

A spokesperson for the NYPD told The Independent that by noon, the protest had been cleared and 10 people had been arrested.

At 5am on Wednesday morning, protestors also gathered outside the New York home of Scott Nuttall, one of the CEOs of investment firm KKR, to protest that company’s investment in fossil fuels. The Independent has contacted a representative from KRR for comment.

On Monday, activists interrupted an interview of Senator Ted Cruz on The View to protest the Texas Republican’s appearance and ABC’s coverage of the climate crisis. On Tuesday, protestors blocked all lanes of traffic on Manhattan’s Park Avenue, home to many of the city’s wealthiest residents, leading to 15 arrests.

Alice Hu, a climate campaigner with NYCC, told The Independent on Tuesday that these are part of a weeklong series of protests along Park Avenue to highlight “billionaires and corporations for their outsized role in driving the climate and inequality crises.”

The protests also come 10 years after Hurricane Sandy hit the area, bringing widespread devastation and killing more than 50 people in New York alone.

“10 years ago Hurricane Sandy hit New York displacing tens of thousands of New Yorkers,” NYCC tweeted on Wednesday. They added that the climate crisis and housing issues have since gotten worse — and demanded that New York Governor Kathy Hochul “#TaxTheRich for green housing for all.”

“Green housing” refers to the concept of homes and apartments that emit few or no carbon emissions, such as through installing solar panels for energy or eschewing fossil fuels for more climate-friendly heating options like electric heat pumps.

Climate protests have also gone into high gear in the UK, where the activist group Just Stop Oil has done a series of actions to highlight the crisis, including smearing cake on a wax figure of King Charles III, throwing soup at a glass-covered Van Gogh painting in a museum and spraying an oil-lobbying firm’s headquarters with paint.

On Wednesday morning, activists with Just Stop Oil sprayed paint on luxury car dealerships in London.",Climate activists occupy BlackRock headquarters on third day of New York protests

Below is the text of the letter with minor adjustments to eliminate the correspondence-related parts.

BlackRock manages assets on behalf of institutional and individual clients worldwide, across equity, fixed income, liquidity, alternatives, and multi-asset strategies. Our clients, the asset owners, include pension plans, endowments, foundations, charities, official institutions, insurers and other financial institutions, as well as individuals around the world. Because our clients have diverse financial objectives, we consider a variety of investment factors, risks, and opportunities, including those related to climate.

Asset managers investing on behalf of clients are not just looking for more data on climate risk; they need high-quality information that is (1) relevant to understanding climate- related risks and opportunities, and (2) reliable, timely, and comparable across jurisdictions. Investors also recognize that climate data, controls and risk methodologies are still evolving. As a fiduciary to our clients, BlackRock has engaged with public companies on climate disclosure over the past five years. We have observed these companies continually developing and adapting their climate risk management and reporting tools, improving the quality of their disclosure over time.

BlackRock strongly supports the ISSB’s goal of providing a global baseline of standards to support the disclosure of more reliable, comparable, and consistent climate-related information. We view both the ISSB Exposure Draft ED/2022/S1 on sustainability-related financial information and ED/2022/S2 on climate-related disclosure as important contributions to a multi-year, multi-jurisdictional effort towards improving the availability, quality, comparability, timeliness, and interoperability of sustainability-related disclosures.

We have separately responded to the ED/2022/S1 on sustainability-related financial information. Our comments below are intended to propose aligning the ED/2022/S2 on climate-related disclosure with the following principles, which we believe will provide investors with high-quality disclosures, while creating the flexibility necessary for continuing development of creative, pragmatic best practices. These principles have similarly guided BlackRock’s response to the climate-related disclosure rules proposed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures for Investors.

While national authorities will ultimately determine the application and scope of ISSB-aligned standards (including the associated liability framework) in their jurisdiction, we encourage the ISSB to continue engaging with global regulators, as well as other standard setters, to ensure interoperability and alignment with the principles outlined below.

Principles for High-Quality Climate-Related Disclosures

TCFD alignment: We support disclosure frameworks aligned with the TCFD framework and sector-specific metrics, such as those that will be taken forward by the ISSB. The TCFD framework has incorporated market feedback and attracted widespread support because of its relative simplicity and Our experience is that it results in clear disclosures that allow investors to assess how companies are adapting their business models to respond to climate-related risks and would provide an effective global framework.

We urge regulators to work with market participants and standard setters, like the ISSB, to continue developing industry-specific guidance.

We strongly support a global baseline of climate-related disclosure standards to enable investors to make more informed decisions. We urge regulators to work with market participants and standard setters, like the ISSB, to continue developing industry-specific guidance. Flexible approach to improving disclosures: We believe that regulators should allow for a “comply or explain” regime (consistent with the TCFD framework) for disclosure areas, such as certain metrics and targets, that are still actively evolving. This regime will allow companies to provide the disclosures or explain why they cannot. A flexible approach to disclosure will likely encourage more and more companies to provide such disclosures.

This regime will allow companies to provide the disclosures or explain why they cannot. A flexible approach to disclosure will likely encourage more and more companies to provide such disclosures. Distinction between Scope 1&2, and Scope 3 disclosures: We support quantitative disclosure aligned with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (“GHG Protocol”). As investors, we use GHG emissions estimates to size an issuer’s climate-related exposure. Specifically, we look to companies to provide Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions disclosures, and meaningful short-, medium-, and long-term science-based reductions targets, where available for their sector. As investors, we use Scope 3 emissions as a proxy metric (among others) for the degree of exposure companies have to carbon-intensive business models and technologies. However, we do not believe the purpose of Scope 3 disclosure requirements should be to push publicly traded companies into the role of enforcing emission reduction targets outside of their control. Given methodological complexity for Scope 3 emissions and the lack of direct control by companies over the requisite data, our investors believe the usefulness of this disclosure varies significantly right now across industries and Scope 3 emissions categories. We encourage regulators to adopt a disclosure framework that accounts for this significant variation. Under this framework, companies would disclose emissions estimates for any of the fifteen Scope 3 categories that are material to them. If none of the fifteen categories are material, or if companies are not yet capable of estimating their Scope 3 emissions, they would have the option of explaining why that is the case.

Consistency across public and private markets: Mandating reporting by companies across both public and private markets is critical to averting unintended consequences in the capital markets such as (1) the sale of physical assets to private companies to avoid disclosure, and (2) private companies being potentially disincentivized from going public, decreasing choice for public market investors. Uniform disclosures would also provide market participants with a clearer understanding of how the transition to a lower carbon economy is progressing across the entire economy. The absence of consistent private and public market disclosure standards forces public companies to step into the role of policing their value chain partners and clients through negotiating the implementation and monitoring of the data they need for their own disclosures, such as private companies’ GHG emissions

We urge regulators to adopt a liability framework that provides meaningful protection from legal liability for disclosures provided in good faith while standards continue to evolve, and that gives companies the flexibility they need to develop their disclosures without imposing a chilling Adequate time for companies to develop high-quality disclosures: Climate-related disclosures often require companies to collect and aggregate data from various internal and external sources. Practical realities of data-collection and reporting do not cleanly line up with financial reporting cycles. Giving companies adequate time (e.g., 120 days) after their fiscal year-end to accurately collect and analyze this data will increase the quality of the climate related information investors receive. This timeline should still result in companies producing climate-related data in advance of their annual meetings, giving investors time to assess it before making proxy voting decisions.

Adhering to relevant materiality thresholds: Finally, we believe companies’ climate- related disclosure obligations in their annual and quarterly reports should be linked to relevant materiality thresholds. Materiality thresholds will assist investors in identifying those companies that consider climate-related risks material to their operations and in evaluating the impact of those risks on companies.

Response to Exposure Draft ED/2022/S2 Climate-related Disclosures

As an investor, BlackRock has been pleased to observe that an increasing number of issuers are using the TCFD framework to provide more detail to their stakeholders through disclosures that are becoming increasingly robust over time. We welcome the ISSB’s alignment with the core principles of the TCFD framework. We strongly support the ISSB’s objective of building a single, global set of baseline sustainability reporting standards on which jurisdictions can build, to accelerate the disclosure of more comparable climate- related information.

The ISSB’s proposed standard for climate-related disclosures will benefit investors and other stakeholders by increasing the quality of information available. We believe this will assist us and other investors in evaluating the material impact of climate risk on particular issuers and in identifying those issuers that consider climate-related risks and opportunities material to their operations. We believe that the proposal sets forth an important roadmap to inform disclosure decisions on climate-risk oversight, strategy, governance, and risk management and will compel issuers to conduct a more thorough analysis than currently undertaken under the existing voluntary framework alone.

Setting out clear international guidelines around these disclosures will help level the playing field for all issuers and, over time, help reduce costs in complying with multiple reporting frameworks. In order to enable issuers to build the appropriate processes and controls to comply, the effective date should be no less than one full year after the standards are finalized.

In offering our support for the ISSB’s efforts to provide a baseline global standard for climate-related disclosure, we are submitting the following specific recommendations, which we believe will allow the final guidance to promote reliable, comparable, and consistent disclosures.

Disclosure of climate-related information in general purpose financial reporting

The ISSB’s exposure draft for climate-related disclosure refers to a company’s ‘general- purpose financial reporting’ as the location that this information should be published. However, given the diversity among national reporting regimes, ‘general purpose financial reporting’ may entail different practical conditions and associated liability per jurisdiction.

Timing: Defining the reporting location as a company’s ‘general purpose financial reporting’ also effectively determines the timing of climate-related disclosure. However, the practical realities of the collection and reporting of climate-related data do not cleanly line up with financial reporting cycles. Climate-related disclosures often require companies to collect and aggregate data from various internal and external sources. As an investor, what we view as most important is ensuring that companies produce climate-related disclosure in advance of their annual meetings, giving investors time to assess the information before making proxy voting decisions. Giving companies adequate time (e.g., 120 days) after their fiscal year-end to accurately collect and analyze this data will increase the quality of the climate-related information investors receive.

Giving companies adequate time (e.g., 120 days) after their fiscal year-end to accurately collect and analyze this data will increase the quality of the climate-related information investors receive. Liability: We recognise that the liability attached to general-purpose financial reporting will depend on national regimes, and consequently the ISSB’s requirement to locate climate-related disclosure within that report will in turn result in differing liability in different jurisdictions. In our view, liability should be commensurate with the evolving nature of climate-related disclosure, to encourage rather than discourage higher- quality disclosure. We urge national regulators to adopt liability frameworks that provide meaningful protection from legal liability for disclosures provided in good faith while standards continue to evolve (for example, in some jurisdictions this may be provided in the form of a safe harbour from liability), and that gives companies the flexibility they need to develop their disclosures without imposing a chilling We recognize that in certain national regimes, this may result in climate-related disclosure being located outside of general purpose financial reporting.

Materiality: Further, while we note that the ISSB Exposure Draft ED/2022/S1 on sustainability-related financial information defines material information in alignment with the definition in the International Accounting Standards Board’s (IASB’s) Conceptual Framework for General Purpose Financial Reporting, in our view, materiality should be determined according to the definition most relevant to each jurisdiction’s wider reporting framework.

Permitting disclosure in the location best aligned with the liability considerations relevant to a specific national jurisdiction, whether or not that is inside of the general purpose financial reporting, will encourage issuers to make more robust climate-related disclosures (including with respect to newly implemented emission targets, scenario analyses and transition plans). Providing issuers with more time after the deadline of their general purpose financial reporting to prepare the information required will also increase the quality and accuracy of the climate-related information that investors receive.

For companies subject to reporting requirements in multiple jurisdictions, providing the option to cross refer to comparable reporting at parent company level may increase the efficiency of disclosure in some instances, and support the transparent disclosure of climate-related risks and opportunities to investors.

Further, explicitly permitting the use of prior quarter estimates could support more timely disclosure by issuers.

GHG emissions disclosure

As an investor, we believe that climate risk is investment risk, and we strive to help our clients make the most informed choices to improve their investment outcomes. We welcome the efforts of the ISSB to draw on the TCFD framework and the GHG Protocol in determining what climate-related information issuers should disclose. We encourage the ISSB to engage with regulators and market participants to provide additional industry-specific guidance on which gases are likely to be material, and how materiality should be evaluated.

Recognizing that relevant data and methodologies are still emerging, we recommend that the ISSB take a flexible approach to GHG emissions disclosures.

Scope 1 and 2 GHG Emissions. We support requiring issuers to disclose their Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions estimates regardless of materiality, as this information helps investors assess exposure to climate-related risks and opportunities across a variety of sectors. However, given the methodological and estimation challenges issuers face today in collecting Scope 1 and 2 data on a timely basis, we are of the view that it is impracticable to require this information to be disclosed or ‘filed’ in general-purpose financial reporting on the annual report timeline, even if material, although that may change over time as these challenges abate. In our response to the SEC’s proposed climate-related disclosure framework, we have included a proposal for a New Form through which issuers could ‘furnish’ all GHG emissions data, given these methodological and estimation challenges. We encourage the ISSB to permit Scope 1 and 2 disclosures—where material—to be incorporated by reference from an appropriate alternative reporting location instead of requiring that it be included in a company’s general purpose financial reporting, unless a robust safe harbor can be provided to afford meaningful protection from liability for Scope 1 and 2 disclosures included in a company’s general purpose financial reporting .

Scope 3 GHG Emissions. As we have said previously, at this stage, we view Scope 3 emissions differently from Scope 1 and 2, given the methodological complexity and lack of direct control by companies over the requisite data to assess Scope 3 emissions. In our experience as investors, these issues, and the usefulness of Scope 3 disclosures more generally, vary significantly across industries and the 15 categories of Scope 3 emissions. We support a ‘comply or explain’ approach to disclosure of Scope 3 in an appropriate alternative reporting location outside of a company’s general-purpose financial reporting, allowing issuers to either disclose material Scope 3 emissions or explain why certain emissions categories are not relevant to the issuer or not subject to reasonable estimation.

As investors, we believe it is important to be able to evaluate companies’ assessments of their emissions across their value chain, or Scope 3 emissions, as such emissions could affect the economic viability of issuers’ business models. Climate risk and the economic opportunities from the transition are a top concern for our clients and a rapidly growing share of them have already committed to net-zero aligned portfolios. As investors, we use Scope 3 emissions as a proxy metric (among others) for the degree of exposure companies have to carbon-intensive business models and technologies. However, we do not believe the purpose of Scope 3 disclosure requirements should be to push publicly traded companies into the role of enforcing emission reduction targets outside of their

Further, as recognized by the US SEC in its proposal The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures for Investors, “the methodologies pertaining to the measurement of GHG emissions, particularly Scope 3 emissions, are evolving,” and with the broader adoption of reporting standards, data sets, and methodologies, they will improve meaningfully further.12 This evolution will require effort on the part of standard setters to provide the further guidance necessary for these disclosures to be reliable and consistent for investors, including with respect to materiality and the appropriate calculation methodology for each category of Scope 3 emissions.

A flexible approach to rulemaking based on a “comply or explain” approach, compared to mandating complete Scope 3 disclosures within general purpose financial reporting before most issuers have the requisite capability, will provide issuers the opportunity to develop the resources necessary to comply with industry standards and best practices as they

AUM Associated Emissions: We support the separate disclosure of GHG emissions associated with assets under management (“AUM”) on behalf of external clients, and encourage the ISSB to specify a methodology to support consistent disclosure. However, while BlackRock reports AUM associated emissions based on the PCAF framework, we note that data, controls and methodologies for computing GHG emissions associated with some asset classes are still emerging, and flexibility will be needed as this area develop.

Whole-of-board approach to governance of climate-related risks and opportunities

We support the objective of enabling a company’s stakeholders to understand the governance processes, controls and procedures used to monitor and manage climate- related risks and opportunities, building on the recommendations of TCFD.

However, in our view, robust oversight with respect to climate-related risks and opportunities requires a whole-of-the-board approach. While we recognize and appreciate that a dedicated committee of the board can be beneficial, especially for companies where climate risk and opportunities are material, the formation of such a committee should be at the discretion of the board. We do not think it is conducive to a holistic approach or, in some cases, appropriate to require companies to disclose the identity of an individual responsible for oversight of climate-related risks and opportunities.

Assessing and managing climate-related risks and opportunities is the purview of management, subject to appropriate board oversight. However, we do not believe issuers should be required to disclose specific details regarding management’s process, but should instead consider which elements of its climate-related governance and risk oversight processes are relevant to its investors. Prescribing a more granular level of disclosures would likely require issuers to disclose a large volume of information that is, on the one hand, unlikely to be material for investors, and on the other hand, may be competitively sensitive for issuers.

Climate resilience, and the evolution of scenario analysis

Where issuers choose to prepare and disclose scenario analysis, this may help a company’s stakeholders assess the climate resilience of its strategy. However, we note that for all issuers, regardless of industry, climate-related scenario analysis has proven to be one of the most challenging aspects of the TCFD recommendations.

Predicting climate change and quantifying its impacts on companies and the economy is inherently complex. We acknowledge the current lack of uniformity across issuers in various industry sectors on the (i) most appropriate climate-related assumptions to use, (ii)

scenarios against which analysis should be conducted, and (iii) client response assumptions to utilize.

Until there is further evolution leading to consistency in climate scenario analysis, the current disclosure landscape is not ready for a mandatory approach to climate-related scenario analysis. We find a “comply or explain” approach consistent with the TCFD framework. to be most appropriate at this time. A flexible approach to disclosure will likely encourage more and more companies to provide such disclosures.

Encouraging climate-related disclosure by private companies

At present, climate-related information with respect to private issuers is lacking in comparison to what is increasingly available from public issuers. To avoid regulatory arbitrage between public and private market climate-related disclosures, we believe that climate-related disclosure mandates should not be limited to public issuers, but should include private companies above an appropriate threshold. Therefore, we encourage national authorities building on the ISSB baseline standard for climate-related disclosure to find innovative ways to include the private markets in their reporting frameworks.

Conclusion

BlackRock strongly supports the ISSB’s goal of providing a global baseline of standards, to support the disclosure of more reliable, comparable, and consistent climate-related information, aligned with the TCFD framework. We view both the ISSB Exposure Draft ED/2022/S1 on sustainability-related financial information and ED/2022/S2 on climate- related disclosure as important contributions to a multi-year, multi-jurisdictional effort towards improving the availability, quality, comparability, timeliness, and interoperability of sustainability related disclosures.

Our recommendations are intended to support the objective set out by the ISSB to promote reliable, comparable, and consistent disclosures. Given the diversity among national reporting regimes, ‘general purpose financial reporting’ may entail different practical conditions and associated liability in different jurisdictions. Therefore, permitting disclosure in the location best aligned with the liability considerations relevant to a specific national jurisdiction will encourage issuers to make more robust climate-related disclosures. For companies subject to reporting requirements in multiple jurisdictions, providing the option to cross refer to comparable reporting at the parent company level, even if outside its general purpose financial reporting, may increase the efficiency of disclosure in some instances, and support the transparent disclosure of climate-related risks and opportunities to investors.

While national authorities will ultimately determine the application and scope of ISSB- aligned standards (including the associated liability framework) in their jurisdiction, we encourage the ISSB to continue engaging with global regulators, as well as other standard setters, to ensure interoperability and alignment with the recommendations outlined above, and to find innovative ways to include the private markets in their reporting frameworks.

Summary Companies Cites May 10 report on climate proxy voting plans

Says BlackRock is not acting in its long-term interests

Says it has put relationship with money manager 'on watch'















LONDON/BOSTON, May 24 (Reuters) - Leading U.S. environmental group the Sierra Club has warned BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) it may pull a $12 million investment after the money manager said it would likely support fewer climate-focused shareholder resolutions at annual company meetings this year.

The world's biggest asset manager said this month it was less likely to support such votes as many were too prescriptive in their demands and not in the interests of clients. read more

The Sierra Club Foundation believes the asset manager's stance put it at odds with the goal of mitigating the harms of climate change, it said in a May 24 letter to BlackRock Chief Executive Larry Fink and other executives seen by Reuters.

The Foundation, which oversees some $220 million in assets, currently invests with BlackRock through Aperio, a unit that runs managed accounts.

""With this publication, we have come to conclude that BlackRock and Aperio are not acting in Sierra Club Foundation’s long-term financial and mission-related interests,"" Dan Chu, executive director at the Foundation, and several colleagues, said in the letter.

A BlackRock spokesman said the company's proxy votes are ""based solely on the long-term economic interests of our clients."" BlackRock also allows many investors to chose how their proxy votes are cast, including clients of Aperio, the spokesman said.

BlackRock has sought to position itself as a leader in sustainable investing, but its efforts have drawn criticism from U.S. clients on various sides of issues like climate change which have grown more politicised. read more

On CNBC on Tuesday, U.S. Senator Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican, criticized BlackRock's Fink for what Cruz said was his ""massive and inappropriate ESG pressure.""

The letter from Sierra Club leaders said part of their purpose is to mitigate harms of climate change. BlackRock's ""work in this regard hardly assists us in our fiduciary duties, and in fact, runs counter to them.""

Oklahoma State Treasurer Todd Russ, a Republican, sent a questionnaire to Wall Street firms BlackRock, JPMorgan, State Street, Vanguard and dozens of others that will determine which corporations “boycott energy companies” because of the engagement in environmental, social and governance investing, or ESG.

Oklahoma will cease business and divest pension funds, such as the Oklahoma Public Retirement System and the Teachers Retirement System, from the companies that answer favorably toward ESG.

The move is part of a broader endeavor by red states across the country to combat ESG, which GOP officials say threatens fossil fuels and energy companies vital to their state economies.

Behemoth asset manager BlackRock is at risk of losing $10 billion alone for managing the state’s Public Retirement System, Mr. Russ warned. Other states last year cumulatively divested more than $4 billion from the firm, political pressure that pales vs. its more than $8 trillion assets under management, but that has forced the company to go on defense.

“After review, your company may appear on the State of Oklahoma’s list of financial companies that boycott energy companies,” Mr. Russ wrote to the firms in a letter attached with the questionnaire. “Such a listing will prohibit Oklahoma governmental entities from investing in and may potentially require divestment from your company, your company’s affiliates and subsidiaries, or investment vehicles affiliated with your company, its affiliates or subsidiaries.”

The questionnaire does not mention ESG directly but poses dozens of related questions, including whether the corporations have any environmental pledges, if they’re members of the financial climate alliance Net Zero Asset Managers initiative and what their investment policies are regarding fossil fuels.

“I took office on January 9th and began compiling a list of companies, banks and other entities that act against Oklahoma’s interests because of their ESG stance,” Mr. Russ said in a statement. “It is my responsibility to ensure Oklahoman’s tax dollars will not be used to enrich organizations that act counter to our taxpayers’ interests and our values.”

Some of the largest targeted companies, including Vanguard, State Street and JPMorgan, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

BlackRock rejected the accusation it “boycotts” energy companies, telling The Washington Times that it currently has more than $200 billion invested in fossil fuels on behalf of clients in Oklahoma and elsewhere.

“BlackRock’s sole focus is delivering the best long-term financial results consistent with our clients’ investment goals,” a spokesperson said in a statement. “We look forward to engaging with the Oklahoma treasurer to discuss how BlackRock serves our clients’ interests in Oklahoma and elsewhere, including over $20 billion of investments in Oklahoma-based public companies made on behalf of our clients and managing public pensions for more than 73,000 Oklahoma beneficiaries.”



Mr. Russ‘ list was composed of 181 finance firms, which have 60 days to respond. No response will result in automatic divestment or termination of state business.

The anti-ESG action follows an Oklahoma law, the Energy Discrimination Elimination Act, that took effect last year. It requires the state treasurer to determine which financial companies are anti-fossil fuels and bar them from managing public funds.

The letter, which was addressed to lawmakers who lead committees on banking and financial services, comes several months after Republican attorneys general criticized asset manager BlackRock for using ESG to guide investments for state pensions.

Republicans are likely to target ESG investing when they assume control of the House of Representatives in January. Patrick McHenry, a Republican congressman from North Carolina who is expected to chair the House Financial Services committee when his party takes over, has spoken out against efforts by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to require companies to disclose information related to climate change.

In recent years more asset managers have started to consider ESG—a broad term that refers to a set of principles relevant to socially conscious investors—in their investment decisions. Half of all professionally managed assets globally will take ESG issues into account, whether through investment selection or shareholder resolutions, by 2024, according to Deloitte. BlackRock, for its part, has incorporated sustainability-related information into its investment process since 2020, recognizing that “climate risk is investment risk.” In an Aug. 4 letter Republican attorneys general called out BlackRock for the practice, arguing the firm uses the “hard-earned money of our states’ citizens to circumvent the best possible return on investment” by considering sustainability.

But the 17 Democratic attorneys general from states including New York and California disagree, arguing in their letter to Congress that “consideration of ESG factors yields important information about risks and rewards, which leads to greater value for beneficiaries.” Companies that fail to take climate change risks into account, for example, “can suffer serious financial consequences” due to physical damage, litigation, or regulatory costs, the letter continues.

Investment firms and companies have gotten plenty of flack for not being transparent enough about their ESG strategies, the attorneys general concede. Firms that rate companies for their ESG commitments have been criticized for prioritizing financial returns over the actual real-world impact of their investments. For example, even though McDonald’s received a higher ESG rating in 2021 for its commitment to save money by reducing packaging material and waste, its overall greenhouse gas emissions increased between 2015 and 2019. Emissions levels didn’t factor into the ESG upgrade awarded to the company.

The SEC has proposed amendments to rules and reporting forms that would establish disclosure requirements for funds and advisers that market themselves as having an ESG focus.",Democratic AGs Defend ESG Strategies After Republicans Pressure BlackRock to Drop Sustainability Principles

The transaction, which is subject to approvals, is the first residential solar and battery investment made by BlackRock’s climate infrastructure business in the Asia-Pacific region.

As part of the acquisition, BlackRock said it intends to commit more than NZ$100m over the next three years to accelerate the growth of SolarZero’s solar and battery technology platform.

Established in 2008, SolarZero provides roof-top solar and smart battery across residential, commercial and community buildings in New Zealand.

Covering the annual meeting season through July, last month's report reveals BlackRock supported just 24 percent of environmental and social shareholder proposals at U.S. companies over the period, marking a major drop from the 43 percent it voted in favor of the previous year.

Given the number of sustainability-focused proposals put forward by shareholders at BlackRock-managed companies rose by 133 percent over the period, it means the number it backed fell from 81 proposals last proxy season to just 71 this year, the report reveals.

In the introduction to the report, Sandy Boss, global head of investment stewardship at the asset manager, claimed shareholder proposals had become ""less supportable"" in the 2021-22 proxy year due to a number of factors.

BlackRock said the decline suggested that 'most investors took a measured, materiality-based approach in their analysis and voting on proposals this proxy year.

Interventions proposed by shareholders had been more prescriptive than in prior years, she said, noting that many sought to ""dictate the pace of companies' transition plans … with little regard to company financial performance."" Other proposals, she noted, had failed to recognize that companies ""had largely already met their ask.""

""This proxy season underscored our belief that a constructive stewardship approach contributes to companies making meaningful progress in their climate-related planning and disclosures, where this is a material financial risk and/or opportunity for them,"" Boss wrote. ""But it also reinforced our long-held view that that the pathway to decarbonization is difficult to predict and will not occur in a straight line. Consistent with that view, we have not supported certain climate shareholder proposals that are overly prescriptive or micro-manage how companies should decarbonize.""

The report argues falling support for environmental and social proposals from shareholders last year was not unique to BlackRock, with support for such proposals at all U.S. public companies dropped from 36 percent to 27 percent over the proxy season.

BlackRock said the decline suggested that ""most investors took a measured, materiality-based approach in their analysis and voting on proposals this proxy year.""

When assessing shareholder proposals, we evaluate each proposal on its merit, with a singular focus on its implications for long-term value creation.

It cites examples of overly prescriptive proposals as those that called for decommissioning fossil fuel assets, the elimination of financing and insurance underwriting for fossil fuel projects, and cessation of fossil fuel exploration and development.

""When assessing shareholder proposals, we evaluate each proposal on its merit, with a singular focus on its implications for long-term value creation,"" the report states. ""We consider the business and economic relevance of the issue raised, as well as its materiality and the urgency with which we believe it should be addressed.""

BlackRock first warned several months ago that its 2022 climate-related shareholder proposals had become more prescriptive compared to the previous year, in the wake of new guidance from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that broadened the scope of permissible proposals that address shareholder social policy issues. The note acknowledged there were ""unique dynamics"" at play during this year's season, arguing that Russia's invasion of Ukraine had made investments in companies that invest in both fossil fuel and renewable energy sources of energy more attractive.

It also claimed to have seen a growing trend whereby companies, particularly in Europe, were increasingly choosing to introduce management proposals on climate action plans and progress, alongside those introduced by shareholders. In these instances, Blackrock said it and other investors were ""increasingly inclined to support the management proposal.""

The firm's increasingly vocal stance on climate has faced criticism amid claims it is at odds with its actual investment activity.

BlackRock has become increasingly vocal about environmental sustainability in recent years, with CEO Larry Fink using his annual letter to shareholders and CEOs to make the economic case for the net zero transition, and also to tout the firm's latest coal exclusion policies, as well as other measures aimed at slashing emissions from the firm's giant asset portfolio.

But the firm's increasingly vocal stance on climate has faced criticism amid claims it is at odds with its actual investment activity, given BlackRock remains one of the world's largest investors in both fossil fuel companies and businesses linked to deforestation.

A report published last year calculated that BlackRock holds $85 billion in coal companies, and in January 2021 the company completed a $15 billion deal with Saudi Aramco to acquire 49 percent of its gas pipeline subsidiary.",'Less supportable': BlackRock holds back approval of US shareholder climate proposals

Summary Companies Backs 71 of 321 E&S votes vs 81 of 172 in prior year

Had warned many were too prescriptive to support

Support for director elections, pay holds steady















LONDON, July 26 (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc , the world's No.1 asset manager, reported on Tuesday a sharp drop in its support for environmental and social-related shareholder resolutions, saying many were too prescriptive, while its backing for directors and executive pay held steady.

BlackRock had warned in May it would back fewer shareholder resolutions because many were too constraining, requiring banks, for example, to stop funding energy companies, or directing their climate lobbying activities. read more

The investment giant also cited November guidance from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that resulted in fewer shareholder resolutions being blocked by the regulator and 245 being put before investors, up 133% on the year.

In the 12 months to the end of June, BlackRock said in a report it had supported 71 of the 321 environmental or social (E&S) shareholder resolutions filed globally, excluding Japan, or 22% of the total. Average market-wide support was 26%, it said.

In the previous year, BlackRock had supported 81 of the 172 E&S resolutions filed, or 47%.

""We observed a marked increase in E&S shareholder proposals that went to a vote and many more proposals were unduly constraining on management or were overly prescriptive as to information sought or timeframes,"" the report said.

""Others failed to recognize the progress made such that companies had largely met the ask of the proposal.""

The majority of votes opposed by BlackRock, some 46%, were because the company had already implemented the changes requested, or had made progress on the issue. A further 21% were rejected for being too prescriptive.

Globally, BlackRock said it voted on more than 173,000 proposals at more than 18,000 shareholder meetings. This followed a record 3,690 meetings with company management.

On the issue of directors seeking election or re-election to the board, which together make up the bulk of all votes globally, BlackRock said it had backed 90% of directors, unchanged from the prior year.

Regarding pay-related resolutions, BlackRock said it backed 80% of the 14,995 votes held globally. It backed 72% of votes in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, up from 70% in the prior year; and 89% in the Americas, down from 92% a year earlier.

Support across all agenda items was given to 57% of companies, unchanged year-on-year.

Linklaters advised the lenders on the solar assets of BlackRock Alternatives’ Climate Infrastructure business in Taiwan, comprising an initial NT$3.913bn (approximately US$125m) long term multi-tranche green loan facility which has the capacity to be significantly upsized.



The initial facility will be used to recapitalise, refinance and fund the construction of New Green Power’s original portfolio of 82MW construction and operational stage solar assets in Taiwan. The portfolio is owned by Global Renewable Power Fund III, a private fund managed by BlackRock Alternatives’ Climate Infrastructure business through its wholly owned subsidiary New Green Power. It aggregates over 100 projects and sub-projects held by a number of operating companies, spanning ground-mounted, floating and rooftop technologies.



This financing builds on the earlier financing of a portfolio of operational solar assets in Taiwan under BlackRock Alternatives’ Climate Infrastructure business which closed in April 2022, and includes a number of further innovative first-in-market features including:

a significant accordion feature which can be used to acquire and fund future projects;

the ability to adjust the pool of assets in the financed portfolio within agreed parameters, allowing the platform to be built out over time; and

flexibility to leverage the platform to conduct early stage development of projects.





The lenders comprised two Taiwanese banks, Bank SinoPac and E.Sun Commercial Bank, and three international banks, BNP Paribas, Credit Agricole CIB and Standard Chartered Bank.

In a shift, Fink kept his discussion of ESG investing to a minimum after a year of backlash.

Fink focused on macroeconomic concerns, notably inflation, and the wider energy transition.

Death, taxes, and Larry Fink's multi-thousand-word letters.

The BlackRock chief executive and cofounder's annual open letters to investors and fellow CEOs — which he combined this year into one roughly 9,000-word piece — have become a certainty in the business world, a wide-ranging document anticipated and widely read by executives, investors, and journalists (like this one) that the firm's public-relations team ensures goes out far and wide.

Fink's letter, published on Wednesday, dissected investors' many macroeconomic anxieties. He addressed historically high inflation around the world, central banks' rapid tightening as efforts to combat that inflation, and Silicon Valley Bank's deterioration that shocked the market this month.

Fink's letters have always focused on business and economics. Though in recent years, he started heavily emphasizing the firm's house view that the climate crisis is investment risk, a stance that drew intense criticism in the US, mainly from Republican officials. Investors pulled some money. A tiny activist investment firm even called for his removal. ""For the first time in my professional career, attacks are now personal,"" Fink told Bloomberg last month. ""They're trying to demonize the issues.""

So it may seem like a natural step that this year, Fink in his letter dialed back talk of investing with environmental, social, and governance factors in mind. There were a couple of references to ""sustainability,"" no mentions of ESG, and no pushback on so-called woke investing. And unlike last year's letter, he didn't strike a defensive tone.

Instead, he focused on more mundane aspects of investing, like (sorry, macro investors!) the direction of interest rates.

""As minority shareholders, it's not our place to be telling companies what to do,"" Fink wrote. ""My letters to CEOs are written with a single goal: to ensure companies are going to generate durable, long-term investment returns for our clients.""

Notably, Fink said he expects inflation to ""stay closer to 3.5% or 4% in the next few years,"" and that it will ""be more difficult for central bankers to tame over the long term."" And in the wake of Silicon Valley Bank's fall, he recalled that prior rate-hiking cycles have ""often led to spectacular financial flameouts,"" pointing to what's become known as the savings and loan crises of the 1980s and 1990s. He wondered whether investors are seeing ""the dominoes starting to fall"" after years of historically low interest rates.

It is clear that Fink's stance on ESG investing has not changed. Across teams and products, its Aladdin tech platform, its investment processes — is is woven into the fabric of the world's largest asset manager. In his letter on Wednesday, Fink talked at length about the transition to a low-carbon economy and BlackRock's role in it. Last fall, the firm formed a unit called Transition Capital, a team aimed at investing in opportunities tied to the energy transition and run by a top former McKinsey sustainability executive.

""We have clients who want to invest in ways that seek to align with a particular transition path or to accelerate that transition. We have clients who choose not to,"" Fink wrote.

But it is also clear that Fink is using his platform less as a vocal champion of ESG and more as a reminder that BlackRock is a fiduciary — it must put its clients' interests, not its own, first — and not an advocacy organization.

It would have been illuminating to hear Fink's comments in his own words. But the wider investment community wasn't given the chance — he didn't go on TV to talk about his letter, first thing in the morning, like he usually does.",BlackRock CEO Larry Fink backs off of sustainability talk in his annual letter after a year of political attacks

The article, titled ""What’s Worse: Climate Denial or Climate Hypocrisy?"", contends that many companies that pledged to invest in more climate friendly initiatives have not fulfilled their promises.

""The era of climate denial has been replaced with one plagued by climate promises that no one seems prepared to keep,"" he wrote.

Wallace-Wells pointed to an annual letter published by BlackRock CEO Larry Fink as evidence for his claim. He noted that Fink ""called global warming the most serious threat to the financial system in his 40 years of experience and promised a drastic response from his firm.""

Wallace-Wells wrote that Fink’s promises included ""making sustainability ‘integral to portfolio construction and risk management’, ditching investments that contribute to the problem; and pursuing not just sustainability but transparency, too, so we all could see what impacts the company was having.""

He asserted that "" finance seemed to take the hint , creating a new wave of purportedly virtuous ‘environmental, social and governance’ (E.S.G.) investing.""

Despite these promises, Fink has recently struck a radically different tone, according to Wallace-Wells.

""But in his annual letter this January, just two years later, Fink struck a radically different tone, rejecting ‘woke’ capitalism and elevating the principle that investors should center only on profits,"" he wrote. ""In the spring, the firm announced it would support fewer shareholder resolutions on climate change, ‘as we do not consider them to be consistent with our clients’ long-term financial interests.’ Just months before, BlackRock closed a $15.5 billion investment in Saudi pipelines.""

LA TIMES SUGGESTS A RECESSION ‘MAY NOT BE THAT BAD’ AFTER COLUMNS DOWNPLAYED INFLATION CONCERNS

""What should we call an about-face like this? The word that comes most easily to mind is ‘hypocrisy’ — or perhaps ‘greenwashing,’ the insult that activists like to lob at companies that use eco-friendly rhetoric to launder their reputations,"" he added. ""This basic phenomenon, in which powerful people make climate pledges that turn out to wildly outrace their genuine commitments, has now become so pervasive that it begins to look less like venality by any one person or institution and more like a new political grammar.""

Critics of ESG argue that it is a mechanism used by the government and private sector to force a transition away from oil and fossil fuels, as well as pushing diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives at the expense of fiduciary duty.

Fox News host Laura Ingraham blasted companies that utilize ESG.

""Environmental, social, governance. The acronym ESG is a classification and rating system that globalists are now using to pressure American companies into adopting progressive practices at every level of their operations.

BlackRock has launched a new ETF in the US providing exposure to developed market real estate holdings while tilting towards energy-efficient and renewables-linked properties.

The iShares Environmentally Aware Real Estate ETF (ERET US) has been listed on Nasdaq with an expense ratio of 0.30%.

The fund is the first US-listed ETF to offer sustainability-focused exposure to real estate assets.

The ETF is linked to the FTSE EPRA Nareit Developed Green Target Index which is based on the parent FTSE EPRA Nareit Developed Index universe that covers real estate investment trusts (REITs) and other property companies listed in developed markets globally.

The methodology first screens out securities that are in violation of UN Global Compact principles or hold significant real estate assets that are used in controversial businesses such as weapons, tobacco, thermal coal, or oil sands extraction.

The remaining securities are then weighted using an optimization technique that increases the weights of real estate holdings with higher ‘Green Certification’ and lower ‘Energy Usage’ scores. A company’s Green Certification score is determined through the proportion of its total net leasable area that is dedicated to producing renewable energy, while its Energy Usage score is derived using its average energy consumption per square metre of net leasable area.

To assess the sustainability performance of the constituents, FTSE Russell harnesses building-by-building geolocation data mapping from GeoPhy. GeoPhy currently maps over 15 million buildings, covering real estate holdings for 93% of the constituents of the FTSE EPRA Nareit Developed Index. This data is then matched with green certification data and provides the basis for detailed energy use and carbon emissions modeling.

Constituents in the index are weighted so as to deliver at least a 30% increase in Green Certification and at least a 10% reduction in Energy Usage, while also maintaining an aggregate carbon emissions footprint that is no worse than the parent universe.

The optimization technique also includes limits on beta and deviations in country and REIT sector weights relative to the parent universe, as well as caps and floors on individual real estate holdings, although these limits may be relaxed to ensure that the index’s sustainability targets are met.",BlackRock debuts climate-conscious global real estate ETF

At least 14 S&P 500 members—including the asset manager, airline and oil refiner—have cited “greenwashing” in their 10-K annual reports so far this year, usually as a business risk factor, according to a Bloomberg Law review of company filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Only five companies in the index referenced it in 10-Ks filed in 2022.

Most conversations focused on potential reputational damage, litigation and US and international regulation over greenwashing, or misleading corporate statements to present an environmentally responsible image. Some of those discussions referenced the fallout from misleading ESG marketing, concerns that other companies also raised without invoking greenwashing by name.

“There’s been more focus on not even whether what they’re saying is true, but can they back it up?” said Alma Angotti, a Guidehouse partner, who has warned clients about greenwashing risks. “They are realizing that maybe they can’t or maybe someone will allege they can’t.”



Embracing ESG

BlackRock Inc. has faced flak from Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and other Republicans over its embrace of environmental, social and governance practices. That same support of sustainability also has led to concerns that the firm is overselling its green credentials.

Bluebell Capital Partners, a small activist shareholder, last year called for BlackRock CEO Larry Fink’s ouster over greenwashing risks from the firm’s continued investment in coal and fossil fuels as the asset manager also promotes sustainability. BlackRock has fought back, saying Bluebell’s effort and its other climate and governance campaigns aren’t in the best financial interests of the firm’s clients.

BlackRock didn’t bring up Bluebell in its 10-K from February. But the asset manager did mention greenwashing in connection with information the Australian Securities and Investments Commission released on the topic last June. BlackRock raised concerns that the firm may face conflicting obligations and regulatory uncertainty as various countries work to stem greenwashing.

The Australian Securities and Investments Commission warned investment firms about greenwashing and included several examples of the practice, like a fund that invests in a way that’s different than what its name appears to indicate. The regulator then brought its first action against a company over greenwashing allegations last October.

The SEC also is working on rules intended to better ensure ESG funds are clear about their investments. The SEC last year reached settlements with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Bank of New York Mellon Corp. over allegations they mishandled ESG funds.

“If you’re in the funds business, you’re going to have to have very clear due diligence procedures,” Angotti said.

A BlackRock representative declined to comment.

‘Chief Trash Officer’

United Airlines Holdings Inc. , like BlackRock, has made amibtious pledges to mitigate climate change. The airline aims to be “100% green by 2050 by reducing our greenhouse gas emissions 100%,” United CEO Scott Kirby says on his company’s website.

The company’s efforts to decrease its carbon footprint have included investments in sustainable aviation fuel, which is made from used cooking oil and farm waste. United in March tapped Sesame Street’s Oscar the Grouch as its “chief trash officer” to promote the initiative.

United’s reputation or brand image could suffer if its customers raise greenwashing concerns over its advertising and marketing of its sustainability initiatives, according to the company’s 10-K from February. Customers, regulators, investors and other stakeholders have increased their scrutiny of how ESG affects companies’ operations and are looking at related disclosures, the report said.

“We pride ourselves on both our work to reduce emissions in the future and with our transparency recognizing the challenges that come with doing so,” company spokesperson Sam Coleman told Bloomberg Law in a statement. “To further our goal to reduce emissions, United remains the global investment leader in the future production of sustainable aviation fuel, while also acknowledging that it makes up a fraction of our current fuel use.”

United’s 10-K comes as the Federal Trade Commission is working to update its Green Guides, which the agency uses to fight companies’ deceptive claims about environmentally friendly products. The FTC last revised the guidance in 2012.

The updated Green Guides could open companies to new greenwashing accusations over advertising, said Amanda Shanor, a University of Pennsylvania assistant professor of legal studies and business ethics. The FTC is looking at providing guidance on “net zero” and other climate change-related claims.

“After the FTC Green Guides explain what something like clean means or what something like net zero means, that may create more liability,” Shanor said.

Litigation Fears

Phillips 66 Co. raised another concern that greenwashing scrutiny is causing: the possiblity of expensive litigation.

Companies are facing more lawsuits and regulatory actions based on claims that companies’ public statements constitute greenwashing, Phillips 66’s 10-K from February said. Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. and The Coca-Cola Company were among companies that said in their recent 10-Ks that they risk unwarranted litigation over their sustainability claims, though they didn’t explicitly mention greenwashing. Coca-Cola last year won two cases over allegations that corporate statements such as a “world without waste” or “doing business the right way” are misleading consumers.

Phillips 66’s 10-K mention of greenwashing risk emerges as environmental groups are suing a California county over allegations it violated environmental law when it approved Phillips 66’s conversion of an oil refinery into a biofuel facility. The company is a real party in interest in the case.

Biofuel made at the Rodeo refinery in Contra Costa County would “cause environmental harm at every step,” according to a petition filed in state court by the Communities for a Better Environment and the Center for Biological Diversity last year. Growing, harvesting and transporting crops for processing and refining and then shipping and burning is “extremely energy-intensive,” the court filing said. Locals also would continue to face industrial pollution, the environmental groups said.

A Phillips 66 representative declined to comment. But the company has said the Bay Area refinery would help California achieve its climate goals and reduce emissions at the facility by 55% and decrease water consumption by 160 million gallons per year.

Phillips 66 and other oil companies can’t bank on the public accepting their environmental claims without scrutiny, said Victoria Bogdan Tejeda, a Center for Biological Diversity staff attorney.

“The public is wising up,” she said. “When fossil fuel companies bill something as a climate solution, they should be skeptical.”","BlackRock, United Join Growing Club Citing Greenwashing Risks (1)"

BlackRock has launched a new thematic equity ETF in the US providing global exposure to companies with recent technological innovations that are helping to address the climate transition.

The iShares Breakthrough Environmental Solutions ETF (ETEC US) has been listed on Nasdaq with an expense ratio of 0.47%.

According to BlackRock, the fund enables investors to express a high-conviction view on emerging environmental technologies in the early stages of adoption.

Specifically, the strategy targets innovations that can be classified into one of the following eight themes: energy efficiency, green buildings, green transportation, pollution prevention and reduction, renewable energy, water, resource efficiency, and sustainable agriculture.

The ETF is linked to the Morningstar Global Emerging Green Technologies Select Index which combines quantitative screens with analysts’ equity research in a process that evolves each year to identify new companies delivering innovative solutions.

The index is constructed from a broad universe of developed and emerging market stocks with market capitalizations above $300 million and average daily trading volumes greater than $2m.

The methodology first conducts a light ESG screen by removing violators of UN Global Compact principles as well as companies with operations linked to controversial weapons, tobacco, civilian firearms, thermal coal, and oil sands.

Index provider Morningstar then utilizes its analyst research to screen for companies deriving at least 25% of their revenue from products or services based on ‘emerging green technologies’ that fit into at least one of the eight themes mentioned above.

A product or service, and its related technology, will be classified as emerging if it falls into one of the first three adoption stages of the Rogers Innovation Adoption Curve. Created by Professor Everett Rogers, the curve is a theory that attempts to explain the rate at which the population adopts a new product, service, or technology over time. The five adoption stages of the curve are Innovators, Early Adopters, Early Majority, Late Majority, and Laggards.

Morningstar then assigns an ‘Innovation Score’ to each eligible company with higher scores reflecting that a firm derives a greater percentage of its overall revenue from products or services linked to emerging green technologies, its products or services on average are in earlier stages of the Rogers Innovation Adoption Curve, or both. Innovation scores run from 0 to 3; firms with scores above 1.5 are classified as ‘Tier 1’ while firms with scores below 1.5 are assigned to ‘Tier 2’.

All Tier 1 stocks are selected for inclusion. If the index contains less than 50 constituents, the methodology also selects the Tier 2 stocks with the highest Innovation Scores until the threshold is met.

Constituents are weighted by float-adjusted market capitalization subject to a single stock cap of 6%.

As of 29 March, stocks from the US accounted for a little over a quarter (26.5%) of the index weight with the next-largest country exposures being China (22.1%), Japan (11.1%), Germany (6.6%), and Switzerland (6.4%).

Companies classified to the industrials sector dominated the index with a combined weight of 40.6% followed by information technology (27.9%), consumer discretionary (18.1%), and materials (7.2%).

Notable positions included Tesla (5.4%), E.ON Next (5.0%), Yaskawa Electric (4.9%), Nibe Industrier (4.6%), and Samsung SDI (4.5%).",BlackRock unveils ‘Breakthrough Environmental Solutions’ ETF

At last year’s climate summit in Glasgow, there was much fanfare surrounding GFANZ (the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero). Founded a few months prior, it committed hundreds of financial institutions to become carbon neutral by 2050.

But on finance day at COP27, Global Witness exposed the poor progress of asset firms which have failed to stop investing in forest-felling commodities.

“A year on from COP26, GFANZ membership is at risk of becoming little more than a badge to be worn by banks and financiers, who continue to plough money into practices that are destroying our forests,” says Veronica Oakeshott, forests campaign leader at the NGO.

COP27 is clamping down on empty net zero pledges

The revelation comes amid a high level crackdown on hollow net zero pledges.

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres presided over the launch of a UN ‘how to guide’ to root out greenwashing in emissions promises yesterday, with fierce words for “fossil fuel companies and their financial enablers.”

“[He] has quite rightly lost patience with greenwashing companies that sign up to net zero but carry on with the same destructive practices as before,” Oakeshott adds.

“Our research shows this is not only a problem with regard to fossil fuel investments but also exposure to deforestation risk. It is not surprising that Mr Guterres, and his group of advisers, are increasingly looking to legislation to hold companies to account.”

GFANZ dropped out of the ‘Race to Net Zero’

The alliance created a buzz at COP26, led by former Bank of England governor Mark Carney who claimed it could “unlock the $1 trillion of additional annual investment needed for the net zero transition in emerging markets and developing countries by the middle of this decade.”

But climate campaigners were quick to express their scepticism. Greta Thunberg was among those denouncing GFANZ as ‘greenwash’, as it allowed institutions to keep investing in fossil fuels while buying carbon offsets.

In its defence, GFANZ said it would form its plans using ""the most rigorous science-based scenarios"".

However, in September Carney had to write to members urging them to stop financing deforestation, warning, “the world will not reach net zero by 2050 unless we halt and reverse deforestation within a decade”.

And in October the alliance announced it was dropping out of the ‘Race to Net Zero’ after the UN-backed campaign upped its standards and threatened to kick out non-performers.

""The recent decision by GFANZ to walk away from Race to Zero and its independently-set targets, including ambitious pledges on deforestation, right at the moment that members might be chucked out for not meeting them, tells you everything you need to know about member intentions,” says Oakeshott.

Which financial institutions are still tied to deforestation?

Since COP26, there has only been a three per cent reduction by GFANZ members in investments at risk of contributing to the clearing of the world's climate-critical forests, the analysis shows.

360 asset managers participating in the alliance continue to hold such investments worth a combined $8.5 billion (€8.47 bn) - almost matching the $9 billion (€8.97 bn) sum President Biden pledged to fight deforestation last year.

Financial giants BlackRock, Vanguard and Deutsche Bank are among those continuing business as usual, says Global Witness. They have continued to invest in agri-business companies that stand accused of mass-scale deforestation such as the Brazilian meatpacker JBS.

In fact, Global Witness finds some members have acquired an additional 10 million shares in JBS since COP26, with Vanguard alone increasing investments in JBS by an estimated €12.4 million.

Tougher laws are needed to hold investors to account

Not all in the financial sector are shirking their responsibility.

On Tuesday, nine financial institutions, managing a combined €175 billion in assets, wrote to the European Commission and Council, asking for the financial sector to be included in the EU’s anti-deforestation law.

Triodos Bank, ASN Bank and Merkur were among the signatories acknowledging that “despite voluntary commitments and policies to tackle deforestation, financial institutions are continuing to provide investments linked to deforestation practices.”

They are trying to bring the Commission round to the Parliament’s position - that the final text for the new Deforestation Regulation to ensure EU products aren’t denuding forests should cover financial institutions too.

If we want any forests left standing, and to have any prospect of avoiding catastrophic climate change, governments must introduce legislation that stops investors contributing to the destruction of rainforests. Veronica Oakeshott Forests campaign leader, Global Witness

Global Witness is also calling on governments in key financial centres to introduce legislation requiring investors to ensure their portfolios are not contributing to rainforest destruction.

“If we want any forests left standing, and to have any prospect of avoiding catastrophic climate change, governments must introduce legislation that stops investors contributing to the destruction of rainforests,” adds Oakeshott.","BlackRock, Vanguard and Deutsche Bank among firms still financing deforestation, new report shows"

A consortium led by New York-based BlackRock, along with UAE sovereign wealth fund Mubadala Investment Co., on April 14 said it would pay $525 million for 10.53% stake in Tata Power Renewables, part of Tata Power, a leader in providing electricity to India since its founding in 1915.

BlackRock, with more than $10 trillion in assets under management, has made a concerted push into renewable energy. CEO Larry Fink in a conference call with analysts last week said the group will likely launch at least three infrastructure funds focused on renewable energy, in part due to rising concerns about energy supplies caused by the war in Ukraine.

“This [the conflict] may mean increasing production of traditional energy sources in the near term, but I believe recent events will accelerate the shift towards greener sources of energy and many parts of the world over the long term,” Fink told analysts in a call in which he discussed the company’s results.

Financing Projects for at Least Two Years

The first round of funding in the Tata deal is expected to be completed by June, with the total investment secured by year-end. Sanjeev Churiwala, Tata Power’s CFO, in a call with media said the funding will finance Tata Power renewables’ projects for at least two years.

Tata Power’s board last week also approved moving all its renewable energy businesses into its Tata Power Renewable Energy Limited (TPREL) division. Tata Power, which is India’s largest power generation conglomerate and has more than 13.5 GW of installed capacity, has said it wants to reduce its dependence on fossil fuels by expanding renewable energy, along with energy storage and green hydrogen production.

The companies in announcing the funding deal said the renewables platform will encompass all the clean energy-related businesses of Tata Power, including those in utility-scale solar; wind and hybrid generation assets; solar cell and module manufacturing; engineering, procurement and construction contracting; rooftop solar infrastructure; solar pumps; and electric vehicle charging infrastructure.

PPAs Set

The companies said the broad-based portfolio of assets would ensure both diversified and stable revenue sources, including 25-year fixed-price power purchase agreements for grid-connected utility-scale projects.

“BlackRock Real Assets and Mubadala will invest by way of equity or compulsorily convertible instruments for the 10.53% stake in Tata Power Renewables,” a statement from the companies said, adding that the final shareholding will range from 9.76% to 11.43% on conversion.

“With one of the largest portfolios of solar and wind assets in the country and a very experienced management team, Tata Power Renewables is at the forefront of India’s ambition to secure greater energy stability for its citizens while positioning its economy for a low carbon future,” said Anne Valentine Andrews, BlackRock’s global head of real assets, in a statement. “India’s success in transitioning its energy economy will be crucial to the world’s ability to meet its climate goals.”

TPREL has about 4.9 GW of renewable energy assets in India, with plans to increase its portfolio to 20 GW as part of a focus on climate and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) goals. India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the COP26 summit in Scotland in November of last year pledged to meet at least half of India’s electricity requirements from renewable energy by 2030. Modi also said his government pledged to cut India’s carbon emissions by 1 billion tonnes by 2030, and achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2070.

‘Next Level of Growth’

“I am delighted to welcome BlackRock Real Assets and Mubadala to join us to take the renewables business to the next level of growth. The collaboration will support us to pursue exciting opportunities that lie ahead in the coming decades,” Praveer Sinha, CEO and managing director of Tata Power, said in a statement.

India is one of the world’s largest renewable energy markets. About 60% of new power generation capacity added in the country over the past four years has been from renewable resources.

Khaled Abdulla Al Qubaisi, CEO for Real Estate and Infrastructure Investments at Mubadala said, “As a responsible investor, Mubadala is focused on renewable energy in multiple markets, so we are delighted to invest in Tata Power Renewables to support energy transition efforts in India in partnership with Blackrock Real Assets. With a proven track record of green and clean energy generation and an experienced management team, Tata Power is one of India’s largest integrated power companies and is well positioned to support the country’s energy independence and transition. We are proud to show our ongoing commitment to India with this investment and look forward to working with Tata Power to capitalize on the growth opportunities ahead.”

This marks the completion of the first tranche of the agreement signed between Tata Power's renewable energy arm and GreenFrost. The transaction is part of an investment deal worth ₹4,000 crore which BlackRock and Mubadala will infuse into Tata Power Renewable Energy.

As per the regulatory filing, Tata Power Renewable Energy issued the preferential shares at ₹239.22 per equity share having a face value of ₹10 each.

Tata Power said, "" This completes Tranche 1 of the transaction. Tranche 2 infusions of ₹2,000 crore will be concluded in accordance with the terms of the agreements.""

On April 14 this year, Tata Power Renewable Energy inked a binding agreement with GreenForest.

Under the agreement, GreenForest will pump in ₹4,000 crore in Tata Power Renewable Energy by way of equity and compulsorily convertible instruments for a 10.53% stake in the latter.

GreenForest is a consortium led by BlackRock Real Assets along with Mubadala Investment Company.

Both BlackRock and Mubadala-led consortium investment will translate to a base equity valuation of ₹34,000 crore for Tata Power's subsidiary. The final shareholding will range from 9.76% to 11.43% on final conversion.

Now, only the second tranche is left for the completion of the transaction. Under the second tranche, Tata Power Renewable Energy will issue 20 crore compulsory convertible preference shares to GreenFrost at ₹100 per share to be converted at a price to be determined based on actual FY23 performance.

BlackRock Real Assets will partner with Vanguard Renewables’ management team to build upon the company’s track record and drive its next phase of growth, including its plans to commission more than 100 anaerobic digesters to produce renewable natural gas (RNG) across the country by 2026.

Since its founding by John Hanselman and Kevin Chase in 2014, Vanguard Renewables has attempted to change the perception of US food waste and how that waste can be recycled into renewable energy to benefit the planet. The company mitigates greenhouse gas emissions from food waste and cow manure through two distinct business lines: Vanguard Organics and Vanguard Ag. Vanguard Organics’ farm-powered anaerobic codigestion process converts inedible food and beverage waste and dairy manure into RNG and liquid low-carbon fertilizer. Vanguard Ag, developed in partnership with Dominion Energy in 2019, converts manure into RNG. Vanguard Renewables believes the multi-year partnership is essential to Vanguard Ag’s growth and Dominion Energy’s commitment to further its ESG goals via significant investments in RNG projects.

“I am immensely proud to have helped build a company from the ground up into a national organic waste-to-renewable energy leader,” said John Hanselman, founder and chief strategy officer at Vanguard Renewables. “Vanguard Renewables’ mission has always been to help America realize a future where waste is a resource for renewable energy generation and regenerative agriculture practice.”

The asset manager has committed NZD$100m of capital over the next three years to accelerate the growth of solarZero’s technology platform.

solarZero is one of the main providers of roof-top solar and smart battery across residential, commercial and community buildings in New Zealand and aims to make solar energy more accessible for New Zealanders, while also reducing their carbon footprint and electricity bills.

It has ambitions of becoming a global provider with plans to expand into a range of markets in Asia Pacific, with a near-term focus on Australia, as well as looking at Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.

Charlie Reid, Asia-Pacific co-head of climate infrastructure at BlackRock, said, “New Zealand is widely recognised as a global leader in renewable energy and climate finance, and we are pleased to make our first investment in this market. Our move into New Zealand demonstrates BlackRock’s commitment to invest in attractive markets as part of our broader efforts to offer a flow of addressable global climate investment opportunities for our clients.

“solarZero is a global pioneer, and we look forward to supporting its expansion into other Asia-Pacific markets and, at the same time, to accelerating New Zealand’s net-zero journey.”

The climate infrastructure business sits within BlackRock Real Assets. The group highlighted in a statement Asia Pacific is a leading region for rooftop solar accounting for 41% of global capacity in 2021 and represents a $4trn opportunity by 2050.

Andrew Landman, head of New Zealand and Australia at the group, commented: “The investment in solarZero further broadens BlackRock Real Assets’ climate infrastructure portfolio in the Asia-Pacific region following its recent investments in Australian battery energy developer, Akaysha, Taiwanese solar energy firm, New Green Power, Korean renewables energy developers, KREDO and Brite Energy Partners, and Australian EV charging provider JOLT, which recently launched in New Zealand.”

Andrew Booth, CEO and founder of solarZero, said BlackRock’s investment and backing will enable the firm to “rapidly increase our scale, grow our energy services network and accelerate the transition to a 100% clean energy future”.

“By 2030, 50% of the world’s energy will be generated in the Asia Pacific region. The window to prevent the worst impacts of the climate crisis is closing fast, and the power couple of solar plus storage is one of the few true paths to energy security, stable power prices and a liveable planet.

“We need to take urgent action and accessing BlackRock’s global network and deep expertise in climate infrastructure will provide the support we need to become a global “solar-as-a-service” solution.”",BlackRock acquires solar firm in New Zealand

Initial funding is expected to be comprised of approximately $650 million divided equally among the three parties.

Daimler Truck North America LLC (DTNA), NextEra Energy Resources, LLC and BlackRock Renewable Power (BlackRock) signed a Memorandum of Understanding to lay the foundation for a proposed joint venture to design, develop, install and operate a nationwide, high-performance charging network for medium- and heavy-duty battery electric and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles in the U.S.

Lack of a publicly available, nationwide electric charging infrastructure for commercial vehicles, especially those used for long-haul freight operations, remains one of the biggest barriers for widespread deployment of electric trucks. With formation of this JV, the three parties will be pooling their resources to address this challenge. The parties plan to build a network of charging sites on critical freight routes along the east and west coasts and in Texas by 2026, leveraging existing infrastructure and amenities while adding complementary greenfield sites to fulfill anticipated customer demand. First phase is set to begin construction in 2023.

Initial focus will be on battery electric medium- and heavy-duty vehicles followed by hydrogen fueling stations for fuel cell trucks; the sites will also be available for light-duty vehicles to serve the greater goal of electrifying mobility.

The proposed JV will benefit from the broad experience and knowledge of its founding members. NextEra Energy Resources, the world's largest generator of renewable energy from the wind and sun, is also a significant investor in electric and charging infrastructure and brings experience optimizing renewable energy, resiliency and grid integration. DTNA offers the expertise of developing electric trucks (start of production of battery electric Freightliner eCascadia and eM2 in 2022/23), walk-in vans and school buses, and the experience of providing consultant services to its customers, the nation's fleet operators. In cooperation with the local utility company Portland General Electric (PGE), DTNA opened the first-of-its-kind public charging site for commercial vehicles in the U.S. BlackRock's Renewable Power group is one of the largest renewable power equity investment platforms in the world. The group seeks to invest across the spectrum of renewable power and energy transition supporting infrastructure globally, with over $9.5 billion in total commitments and investments in over 350 wind and solar projects, in addition to electric vehicle charging infrastructure and battery energy storage systems, across 15 countries and 5 continents. BlackRock's Renewable Power group is a part of BlackRock Real Assets.

John O'Leary, president and CEO DTNA, said: ""This planned joint venture, and our collaboration with BlackRock and NextEra Energy Resources, will address the urgent need for a nationwide battery electric and hydrogen fuel charging infrastructure for commercial vehicles to reach shared climate goals. Our joint investment will act as a catalyst to make a carbon-neutral trucking industry a reality. This project is a critical step toward developing a sustainable ZEV ecosystem across North America, and we look forward to including additional partners as it progresses. We are committed to providing access to this network not only for the DTNA vehicle brands, but also for any manufacturers using predominant industry charging standards and communication protocols.""

""Working with Daimler Truck North America and BlackRock, we expect to accelerate the transformation of the transportation sector and make future investments in electrification upgrades, charging stations and renewables,"" said John Ketchum, president and CEO, NextEra Energy Resources. ""This collaboration builds on our market-leading eIQ Mobility software platform for quantifying the value and timing of fleet conversions and our decarbonization-as-a-service platform that help fleets execute on their plans to transition to zero emission electric and hydrogen vehicles.""

David Giordano, Global Head of BlackRock's Renewable Power Group, said, ""The commercial transportation sector is a significant contributor to carbon emissions and we firmly believe that decarbonization of transportation will be a critical societal focus for the next decade. Having already made several investments in the EV charging infrastructure space around the globe, we also believe that investments in the sector are highly complementary to our renewable power generation investment strategy. We are pleased to collaborate with NextEra Energy Resources and Daimler Truck North America on this proposed joint venture, which has the potential to provide our clients with access to compelling opportunities that support the energy transition.""

GRP III follows GRP I, a 2012 vintage, and GRP II, a 2016 vintage, both of which are fully invested.

David Giordano, Global Head of BlackRock Renewable Power, commented, “ We are delighted with the success of this fundraise, which is a testament to the strong global demand for renewable power assets and to our team’s ability to build resilient portfolios that help clients meet their financial and sustainability objectives. By sourcing, building, and optimizing assets throughout their lifecycle, we believe that renewable power has the potential to generate attractive risk adjusted returns and stable cash yields for investors with low correlation to the economic cycle.”

Jim Barry, Chief Investment Officer of BlackRock Alternative Investors and Global Head of BlackRock Real Assets, commented, “ GRP III invests in the sustainable infrastructure of the future. As the world strives toward net zero carbon emissions by 2050, the transition will have dramatic impacts not only for public equities but for private markets as well, creating significant opportunities for front-footed investors. BlackRock is committed to growing its sustainable private market offerings across asset classes, including climate infrastructure.”

Disclosures

Capital at risk. The value of investments and the income from them can fall as well as rise and are not guaranteed. Investors may not get back the amount originally invested. Past performance is not a reliable indicator of current or future results and should not be the sole factor of consideration when selecting a product or strategy. Changes in the rates of exchange between currencies may cause the value of investments to diminish or increase. Fluctuation may be particularly marked in the case of a higher volatility fund and the value of an investment may fall suddenly and substantially. Levels and basis of taxation may change from time to time. Tax treatment depends on the individual circumstances of each client and may be subject to change in the future.

Infrastructure Funds. Infrastructure Funds invest exclusively or almost exclusively in equity or debt, or equity or debt related instruments, linked to infrastructure assets. Therefore, in addition to risks associated with investment in such equity or debt instrument, the performance of an Infrastructure Fund may be materially and adversely affected by risks associated with the related infrastructure assets including construction and operator risks, environmental risks, legal and regulatory risks; political or social instability; governmental and regional political risks; sector specific risks; interest rate changes; currency risks; and other risks and factors which may or will impact infrastructure and as a result may substantially affect a fund’s aggregate return. Investments in Infrastructure assets are typically illiquid and investors seeking to redeem their holdings in an Infrastructure Fund can experience significant delays and fluctuations in value.

Liquidity Risk. The Fund’s investments may have low liquidity which often causes the value of these investments to be less predictable. In extreme cases, the Fund may not be able to realise the investment at the latest market price or at a price considered fair.

Valuation risk. The Fund will be exposed to securities and other assets that will not have readily assessable market values. The valuation of such securities and other assets is inherently subjective and subject to increased risk that the information utilised to value such assets or to create the price models may be inaccurate or subject to other error. Due to a wide variety of market factors and the nature of the securities and assets to which the Fund will be exposed, there is no guarantee that any value determined will represent the value that will be realised on the eventual disposition of the Fund’s investments or that would, in fact, be realised upon an immediate disposition of such investment.

Lack of available investments. The Fund will be competing for exposure to investments in a highly competitive market, against other funds, as well as individuals, financial institutions, strategic players and other investors, some of which may have greater resources than the Investment Manager. There can be no assurance that the Fund will be able to locate, attain and exit investments that satisfy its investment objectives, or that the Fund will be able to fully invest its committed capital.

Redemption risk. The Fund’s investments are generally illiquid and therefore an investment in the Fund is intended for long-term investors able to accept the risks associated with an illiquid investment and who are able to commit their funds for the duration of the Fund Redemptions, to the extent they are permitted, may be limited, postponed or altogether suspended in certain circumstances.

The state treasury will immediately have Florida’s custody bank freeze about $1.43 billion worth of long-term securities and remove BlackRock as the manager of approximately $600 million worth of short-term overnight investments, Florida Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis said in a statement on Thursday. The pullback is the latest step in a broader fight led by Republican Governor Ron DeSantis against corporations that embrace environmental, social and corporate governance values.

“I need partners within the financial services industry who are as committed to the bottom line as we are – and I don’t trust BlackRock’s ability to deliver,” Patronis said in the statement.

“Using our cash, however, to fund BlackRock’s social-engineering project isn’t something Florida ever signed up for,” he said. “It’s got nothing to do with maximizing returns and is the opposite of what an asset manager is paid to do. Florida’s Treasury Division is divesting from BlackRock because they have openly stated they’ve got other goals than producing returns.”

Reuters reported Florida’s planned divestiture earlier. The Florida Department of Financial Services manages approximately $60 billion in taxpayer money.

Terms of the transaction were not disclosed.

According to the two companies, the acquisition will enable NRS to accelerate the construction and realization of that 3.5 GW pipeline, supporting NRS’ on-the-ground development and origination expertise with BlackRock’s capital markets support and global reach.

While NRS is based in Minneapolis, the company has primarily operated in in the Western United States, having developed more than 1 GW of projects since its foundation in 2011. Currently, the company’s roughly 3.5 GW solar and wind development pipeline includes projects in New Mexico, Colorado, Arizona and Nevada. It is, however, an expressed part of NRS’ mission as a company to revitalize rural communities via investments in domestic renewable energy resources that benefit local landowners.

In recent years, BlackRock’s support for renewables has grown incrementally, launching Distributed Solar Development, a behind-the-meter company in 2019, acquiring a 10.3% stake in inverter manufacturer SolarEdge, and investing $300 million into Clean Capital.

However, as the world’s largest asset manager, some have called these investments merely incremental, and a 2020 report from the nonprofit Majority Action, “Climate in the Boardroom,” referred to the company’s environmental and renewable ventures to that point as “tinkering at the edges” of real progress.

Since that report, Larry Fink, chief executive of BlackRock, said he backed the UK’s move to make reporting corporate risk related to climate change mandatory, and urged the U.S. to follow suit.

“We welcome the UK Chancellor’s announcement yesterday (of) mandatory TCFD reporting,” said Fink. “The United States, for its part, should move faster so we can achieve greater global coordination.”",BlackRock acquires developer National Renewable Solutions

It is the first BlackRock Real Assets investment in South Korea’s offshore wind sector, part of the deployment of BlackRock’s latest Global Renewable Power strategy which recently raised US$4.8bn.

KREDO, previously known as IGIS Private Equity, is one of South Korea’s largest renewables developers. It owns an advanced pipeline of offshore wind and other renewables assets amounting to over 2GW in power generation capacity.

Charlie Reid, managing director of BlackRock Renewable Power, said: “We believe offshore wind will play a vital role in the nation’s road to decarbonisation, and that KREDO Holdings is ideally placed to partner with us.”

South Korea’s country’s rapid evolution towards renewable energy made it a priority investment market for BlackRock clients, he said.

Jeong-Hoon Doh, CEO and representative director of KREDO Holdings, said the significant investment from BlackRock would contribute to the South Korean government’s net zero commitment by 2050.

BlackRock plans to invest more than US$1bn of equity over time to build out KREDO’s portfolio of assets.

Larry Fink's annual letter to CEOs is probably the most-read note in American boardrooms due to the influence the head of the world's largest asset management company has on global money markets. For a number of years now, the powerful BlackRock boss has flagged change, urging his readers to support ESG goals, meaning investing with ""environment, social and governance"" aspects as priorities.

In this year's letter, published in January, Fink again warned that ""every company and every industry will be transformed by the transition to a net-zero world,"" and added that the only question companies would have to ask themselves was: ""Will you lead, or will you be led?""

Currently, BlackRock manages $7.96 trillion (€7.49 trillion) in assets from around the world, including stakes in almost all German blue-chip companies. So its CEO's call for action on sustainability in company policy seems relevant on a global scale.

A small-fry rebellion

BlackRock's ESG push dates back to 2020, when the company said it believes that ""sustainability should be our new standard for investing."" Its CEO's newfound heart for nature and human rights was met with skepticism at the time. Environmentalists even accused the company of making a brazen attempt at greenwashing its investment policy.

Now, Fink's renewed call has caught the ire of Bluebell Capital Partners, a small investor worth about $250 million with a 0.01% stake in BlackRock, according to the London-based firm.

In a letter to BlackRock's board dated November 9 and first reported in the Wall Street Journal, Bluebell said it is ""increasingly concerned about the reputational risk (including greenwashing risk)"" to which Fink's recent statements have ""unreasonable exposed"" BlackRock, and which would fuel ""a gap between the 'talk' and the 'walk' on ESG investing.""

In addition, Bluebell urged the board to conduct a strategic review of the company's stance on ESG to eliminate inconsistencies and contradictions. While Fink could stay on as chairman, ""that role should be split from that of CEO,"" Bluebell wrote.

Since its launch in 2019, Bluebell Capital Partners has won a reputation for making big gains on small money. As an activist investor it has taken on the likes of luxury retailer Richemont, mining giant Glencore, media company Vivendi and pharmaceutical firm GlaxoSmithKline. Last year, it helped engineer the ouster of Danone Chairman Emmanuel Faber, even though it only had a stake of about €20 million in the French food group.

One of the complaints raised by Bluebell in its letter includes BlackRock's reported opposition to some of those campaigns.

In a statement to DW, BlackRock wrote: ""In the past 18 months, Bluebell has waged a number of campaigns to promote their climate and governance agenda. BlackRock Investment Stewardship did not support their campaigns as we did not consider them to be in the best economic interests of our clients.""

The talk and the walk

Giuseppe Bivona, partner and chief investment officer of Bluebell, told US broadcaster CNBC earlier this month: ""We are criticizing BlackRock for the contradiction and the hypocrisy between what they say and what they do.""

Bivona cited BlackRock's ongoing investments in fossil fuels like coal, which would undermine the company's credibility. He also said BlackRock refused to support a Bluebell campaign against chemical group Solvay aimed at stopping the Belgian company from discharging industrial waste from its facility in Rosignano, Italy, into the Mediterranean Sea.

As a result of these failings, Bivona demanded that CEO Larry Fink be replaced. He also urged BlackRock's board to ensure the company stays away from ideological convictions in climate and energy policy. ""This issue should not be BlackRock's mission to promote energy policy or to promote any public debate on environmental or social issues,"" he told CNBC.

Republican pushback in America

In 2022, the largest 10 ESG funds in the US posted double-digit losses, raising criticism mainly from Republican lawmakers about BlackRock's investment strategy. They've accused the asset manager of boycotting fossil industries and putting its sustainable investing policy over investor returns.

""We're an energy state, and energy accounts for hundreds of millions of dollars of tax revenue for us,"" said Riley Moore, the treasurer of West Virginia, in an interview with the New York Times in May. ""All of our jobs come from coal and gas. This is part of our way of life here.""

Moore also said BlackRock's call for companies to become more sustainable would be an ""existential threat,"" and added: ""We have to fight back."" Earlier the West Virginia treasurer pulled $20 million from BlackRock — a trifle of the state's overall investment managed by BlackRock, but a highly publicized PR stunt nevertheless.

In early December, the state of Florida said it would pull about $2 billion from BlackRock because of its ESG investments. In Texas a new law bars the state's retirement and investment funds from doing business with companies that the state comptroller says are boycotting fossil fuels. Conservative lawmakers in 15 other states are promoting similar legislation.

ESG up to a point

Republican anger at BlackRock's ESG push is unsubstantiated, given that the asset manager is still heavily invested in polluting industries, environmental activists say.

Data from 2020 collected by German nonprofit climate organization Urgewald and its French counterpart Reclaim Finance, show that BlackRock had ""at least $85 billion"" invested in the global coal industry. Moreover, ESG standards were only applied to the firm's actively managed funds and not passive exchange traded funds that make up three-quarters of its assets.

BlackRock itself has admitted that it has often turned a blind eye to its ESG policy.

""We are the world's largest investor in fossil fuel companies, and, as a long-term investor in these companies, we want to see these companies succeed and prosper,"" Dalia Blass told a hearing of the Texas Senate Committee on State Affairs in January.

Blass, BlackRock's head of external affairs, also said the company has $260 billion invested in fossil-fuel businesses at the moment of which $91 billion are invested in Texas-based firms, including ExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips and Kinder Morgan.

Fink, meanwhile, told a conference organized by the New York Times in November that BlackRock would push for ESG policies, but only if it is in the interest of shareholders.

""We focus on sustainability not because we're environmentalists, but because we are capitalists and fiduciaries to our clients. The fair pursuit of profit is still what animates markets; and long-term profitability is the measure by which markets will ultimately determine a company's success,"" Fink said.

He also noted that he's never wanted his letters to CEOs to be influential, rather he wanted them to be ""topical."" They are intended to deliver a ""narrative"" for the next 20 to 30 years, he said. ""If we lose that long-term hope, it's going to be harder for the US to have differential growth.""

Whether Bluebell Capital buys Fink's vision is doubtful, but so is its bold attempt to oust the powerful BlackRock CEO. In the end money talks and ESG policies will only succeed if they pay investors enough dividends.

Structural reforms with austerity have resulted in soaring inflation, currency depreciation, poverty and inequality that is eroding Argentine society and economy, while enabling bail out of private lenders and vulture funds like BlackRock.

Argentina is now on its 21st IMF agreement and eighth Default! Sri Lanka negotiating a 17th IMF agreement having defaulted for the first time in April this year may be doing marginally bit better than Argentina, which is South American’s 3rd largest economy. However, the strategic Indian Ocean island perpetually in the cross-hairs of big power rivalry appears to be in the midst of asset stripping ex-ante IMF negotiations with International Sovereign Bond (ISB) debt holders, who caused the country to default for the first time in its history in April this year.

As a staff level agreement with the IMF is under discussion, Minister of Power and Energy, Kanchana Wijeratne gave BlackRock’s partner, Adani, provisional approvals and strategic lands for two wind power projects in sensitive ecosystems in Northern Sri Lanka, Mannar and Pooneryn, without Environmental Impact assessments being complete last week.

Wijesekera had decided to award the projects and lands to Adani following a meeting with officials of Ceylon Electricity Board and Sustainable Development Authority last Tuesday.[i] The Minister added that Public private partnership agreements would be signed pertaining to 21 of the 46 projects that were delayed due to the CEB Act amendments. 26 Renewable proposals from expression of interests that was given Provisional Approvals would be also expedited with grid clearance and transmission plans, with other proposals evaluated within 30 days. [ii]

As the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL), engages in talks for a Staff Level Agreement with the lender of last resorts, Sri Lankan citizens may need to learn some lessons from Argentina, fast! Back in 2020, BlackRock had opposed a debt settlement deal with Argentina and lobbied other debt holders as the country grappled with soaring poverty and the Covid-19 pandemic.

The International Monetary Fund said it will need “adequate assurances” from Sri Lanka’s creditors for a new program as it prepares a visit to Colombo later this month.The goal of the visit is to make progress on a staff-level agreement for an aid package “in the near term,” to help the island nation weather a severe economic crisis, the IMF said on Friday. Staff from the global lender will be in Colombo from August 24 to 31.

Since the IMF has assessed Sri Lanka’s public debt “as unsustainable”, approval by its Executive Board of the Extended Fund Facility program would require adequate assurances by Sri Lanka’s creditors that debt sustainability will be restored,” the IMF said.

Last week a global campaign by women’s groups asked UN Women to rescind an MOU with BlackRock for gender-lens funding due to its poor corporate responsibility track record.

IMF, BlackRock and Lazard in Sri Lanka’s Default: Ex-Ante Asset Striping

BlackRock, the world’s largest asset and investment management company with over $10 trillion is the largest holder of Sri Lanka’s opaque ISB debt that caused the country’s Staged Default in April this year. ISBs amounts to almost fifty percent of Sri Lanka’s external debt.

In comparison to BlackRock’s trillions Sri Lanka’s external debt is a mere $ 26 billion. Black Rock also got huge Covid Bailout funds from the US government to asset strip around the world during economically devastating global lockdowns in 2020, and is an investor in India’s Adani Group.

Ironically, the IMF which does not distinguish between illiquidity and insolvency has assessed Sri Lanka’s $26 billion external debt as unsustainable although the island is oil, gas and mineral rich and located at the Center of the Indian Ocean on the world’s busiest trade and undersea data cables, which if properly taxed would render the island super-rich!

An economic meltdown ex-ante and ex-post the Staged Default in April this year due to a purported lack of US dollars amid Corporate media narratives of famine and fear as part of a Psychological Operation along with people’s protest enabled the entry of the Washington Consensus (IMF and WB), into the strategic island that is perpetually in the cross-hairs of big power rivalry and Over the Horizon Operations (OTH), the more so as Cold War heats up in the Indian Ocean region.

While the IMF does not distinguish between a country’s illiquidity and insolvency, the valuation of strategic assets by Lazard et al. hired by the US-backed Ranil Rajapakse regime in Colombo may also raise troubling questions. Lazard, the US-based financial advisory and asset management firm, had visited Sri Lanka in back in February 2018 to discuss divestment. As a privatization advisor, Lazard involves both an advisory services branch and asset management branch. On numerous occasions, Lazard has undervalued the price of a company, enabling the latter to purchase the stock at low prices and sell it for a considerable profit according to a report of the Amsterdam based Transnational Institute that notes:.[iii]

As with the Royal Mail, Lazard, Europe’s favourite privatisation advisor, played a key role in AENA’s under-evaluation before its IPO as it helped determine the IPO price. And comparable to what happened during the privatisation of UK’s Royal Mail, one of Lazard’s asset management branches, Lazard World Dividend & Income Fund, acquired AENA (Spain’s Airports company) shares at the IPO and sold them roughly a month later netting a 60% profit.58 By buying up and selling the AENA shares within such a short period of time, Lazard’s World Dividend & Income Fund deviated from its usual strategy. As the name suggests, the company usually focuses on long-term investments and profit generated by dividends.59 In the case of AENA however, Lazard‘s World Dividend & Income Fund were only too happy to drop their customary strategy when it yielded a 60% increase of their investment in just four weeks. Once again, Lazard took full advantage of its privileged position on both sides of the fence, as seller and buyer making a huge profit in the process.

The I.M.F. had long been accused of wielding a single blunt instrument— austerity in crises and forcing the poor to the bear, the costs of opaque and Odious debt accumulated by corrupt and incompetent leaders in developing countries, and passing it on to impoverished citizens, while ‘bailing out’ vulture funds, prominent among them BlackRock and the global 1 percent.

It would appear that Adani and BlackRock are targeting the strategic Indian Ocean island’s coastal lands, energy and telecom infrastructure at this time of IMF discussions on Sri Lanka’s debt and Staged Default and stand to benefit from the debt restructuring process– ex ante! Where does the corruption end?!

Adani and BlackRock Greenwash

Adani which partners with BlackRock, stands to benefit ex-ante IMF-CBSL-ISB talks from the Mannar and Poonaryn land deals for Green Wind Energy. But questions arise: Why the rush to costly green energy, without a proper energy transition plan in Sri Lanka, which has a minute carbon foot print at this time of global fuel price increases, and as a result of unplanned green energy policies (like the organic fertilizer disaster), is a question that many are asking? Is this a sweetheart deal ex-ante IMF negotiations with ISB holders for BlackRock to tow the line?

These questions arise also given the poor environmental track record of both Adani and BlackRock, which elicited global protest campaigns against the latter’s funding of UNWOMEN. Adani and BlackRock were also the subject of a global protest campaign given the environmental impacts of the Carmichael Coal mine project in Australia on the Great Barrier Reef last year.

An IMF Firesale of assets in the strategic island would benefit opaque ISB holders of Sri Lanka’s Odious debt, with Sri Lankan Airline set to be privatized soon. The state-owned Yugadanavi Power plant was sold to a US company, New Fortress, last year. The Ceylon Electricity board is being fragmented and plans are afoot for sell off in parts, jeopardizing national energy security and so too the Petroleum Corporation.

However, rather than privatize energy assets, globally re-nationalization of energy infrastructure given soaring energy prices and commodities futures speculation is the trend globally, with France set to Nationalize its largest electric company, and the Singapore Parliament passing legislation last year conferring on the Energy Market Authority (EMA) more powers to secure Singapore’s electricity supply,

Adani had also sought to take over India’s Agriculture sector during the Covid panicdemic exercise, but two years of brave and sustained protests by India’s farmers (unlike Sri Lanka’s Aragalaya which fizzled out after a couple of months of protests that enabled a US backed Ranil Rajapakse Presidency), prevented the global corporate takeover of India’s farming and agriculture.

IMF in Argentina: lessons unlearned

Did the ‘lender of last resorts’ learn lessons in Argentina? The IMF’s “rescue package’ in Argentina two decades ago imposed crippling cuts to government programs, sowing enduring bitterness. Ms. Georgieva, the fund’s managing director, claims that the “lender of last resorts” learned lessons and has sharpened a focus on protecting countries from impossible debt burdens.

However, BlackRock, opposed a debt settlement deal with Argentina as the country grappled with soaring poverty and the pandemic in 2020 although.[iv] BlackRock CEO, Laurence D. Fink presents himself as the vanguard of a progressive form of capitalism in which profits are not everything and has been rebranding the corporate with while cultivating environmental and social protection causes.

But when Argentina defaulted in May 2020 on $66 billion worth of bonds, Mr. Fink’s faith in “stakeholder capitalism” collided with traditional bottom line imperatives. Though poverty soared in Argentina as the pandemic worsened a punishing economic downturn, BlackRock opposed a settlement proposed by the government and rallied other creditors to reject it, while holding out for a marginally improved deal.

Meanwhile in another continent, following massive protests in Australia and globally the Adani and BlackRock seem to be busy Greenwashing themselves and presenting a Green Energy face in Sri Lanka. Thus Adani has been given provisional approvals for two wind power projects in strategic and sensitive ecosystems in Mannar and Pooneryn, without Environmental Impact assessments completed, by a Minister who should have resigned given the incompetence and corruption in the sector that brought the country to a standstill in June –July ex-ante and ex-post the Staged Default, ensuring a crisis that legitimated the IMF’s eroding Sri Lanka’s economic policy autonomy and sovereignty against its citizen’s interests.

UN WOMEN campaign: From Greenwash to Pinkwash

Adani and BlackRock are accused of environmental pollution globally, and BlackRock was recently called out in a global feminist campaign that focused on UNWOMEN’s MOU for partnership with BlackRock and taking funding form the investment giant.The campaign focused on the “fad of Climate “impact investment”, stating that: Civil society watchdog groups consistently identify BlackRock as among the worst performers on corporate accountability. Its climate and socially-destructive investments — particularly significant in impact because of the massive component they represent of BlackRock’s portfolio — have been called out by activists, including Indigenous leaders. Aware of the optics, BlackRock has attempted to ‘greenwash’ itself by acknowledging the seriousness of climate change – in a move that the New York Times has condemned as ‘climate hypocrisy’ that is intentionally misleading; worse than climate denial.

The recently-announced partnership with UN Women suggests that UN Women has been

recruited to BlackRock’s image-cleansing efforts – this time it is seeking to ‘pinkwash’ itself read a letter addressed to the head of UNWOMEN and signed by Hundreds of women’s organizations and individuals around the world. Thus they wrote:

BlackRock funding UN Women gives it a veneer of feminist approval that it clearly does not merit. Given BlackRock’s phenomenal size and influence (reportedly managing ten trillion USD) in assets, it is not unreasonable to assert that this UN Women partnership also gives a feminist imprimateur to the version of neoliberal global capitalism that is condemned by the Secretary Generatl. This crisis-prone speculation-based capitalism, spawning grotesque income inequalities, has also been linked to misogynistic neo-populism and entrenched poverty for many women, particularly those from ethnic or racial minorities, marginalized sexualities, and female-headed household.

Importantly the Women’s organizations, academics and activists who signed the letter also noted: UN Women needs to rescind the partnership with BlackRock and set standards for its private sector partnerships. The same critique may be make of other UN agencies like the World Health Organization funded by Big Pharma and the Gates Foundations and UNDP funded by big oil companies like Shell to promote Debt for Nature Swaps (DFNS), need revised standards for private sectors partnerships.

The Privatization Industry: National Security Jeopardized?

The UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called out profiteering by private oil giants earlier this month and said was “immoral” that the largest energy companies in the first quarter of the year made combined profits of close to $100 billion. He urged all governments to tax these excessive profits “and use the funds to support the most vulnerable people through these difficult times.

The worst time to privatize strategic assets is in a global emergency and jeopardize national energy security as Cold War looms amid soaring oil and gas prices. Privatization is no panacea for cultivated state-sector corruption to under-mine government institutions as a pretext to privatization a la the Privatization Playbook.

A trend away from privatization towards re-nationalization of energy infrastructure is visible globally at this time as energy security of countries becomes paramount. Last November the Singapore Parliament passed a Bill to safeguard Singapore’s energy security and reliability in the long term.[v] The Bill provides the Energy Market Authority (EMA) with more powers to secure Singapore’s electricity supply, as the country transits to cleaner sources of energy to acquire, build, own and operate critical infrastructure, which reverses privatization.

The French government likewise said Wednesday that it plans to fully take over its largest electricity provider Electricity de France (EDF). The nationalization of EDF comes as the European Union feels the effects of its partial bans on Russian energy. Russia is the largest supplier of energy products to the EU, accounting for 62% of crude oil imports and 25% of natural gas imports to the bloc in 2021.[vi] Soft Re-nationalisation is also ongoing in Hungary.

However, Sri Lanka is self-destructing its energy security by “unbundling energy infrastructure’ ex-ante IMF-ISB talks, despite evidence that privatization is not a solution for citizens, as private global energy companies have made massive profits while inflation soars and people starve due to high oil and gas prices.

The IMF does not recognize the difference between ‘illiquidity’ and ‘insolvency’, or the fact that “location, location, location” matters in valuing assets, or the fact the island’s mineral-rich sea bed has UDC data cables that keep the global financial and economic system going, and if taxed would render the country super rich! Thus, Adani which is backed by BlackRock is poised to take over sensitive lands on Greenwash project in Sri Lanka while the IMF operation to divest the island of valuable lands, energy, telecom and transport infrastructure assets is on-going as part of a bailout of predatory vulture funds that prey on the citizens of the global south in collaboration with the Ranil-Rajapaksa regime in Colombo.

The current President was also responsible for the biggest financial fraud in the country– the Bondscam of 2015 at the CBSL. The largest share of the SL’s ISB debt – nearly 70 percent – was accumulated during the 2015-2019 when Ranil Wickramasinghe was in power. He was brought back to power in a regime change operation less than three months ago to steer IMF negotiations and enable asset stripping.

Indeed, as Sri Lanka negotiates a “Staff-level Agreement” with the IMF, it seems to be fully remote controlled from Washington DC with New Delhi as a junior partner. The country is already in structural adjustment mode and being readied for an IMF Firesale and asset stripping as part of a “bailout” of US and EU-based International Sovereign Bond (ISB) holders.

However, given the Odious nature of the debt accumulated in deals between corrupt politicians and predatory ISB holders, academics and activists in Sri Lanka have called for outright Cancellation of ISB debt, and restructuring of only bi-lateral and multi-lateral debts. While it is claimed that investors holding emerging market bonds run the gamut from specialized funds with high tolerance for risk to conservative pension funds, the Funds should do due diligence and ensure that they are not party to Odious debt accumulation in poor countries in the Global South!

Adani List of the Carmichael Project

The Adani List page reveals BlackRocks massive financial interest in Adani and the companies involved in the Carmichael coal export project in Australia that resulted in massive environmental protests. BlackRock has a huge stake in many of the companies that comprise the Adani List, which consists of the insurance, construction, engineering and infrastructure providers to the Adani Carmichael mine and rail project. Companies on the Adani List shows BlackRock holds a total of US$26.8 billion in companies that are providing services to the Carmichael project, including some very influential stakes in some companies.

BlackRock holds the following stakes in Adani List companies: [vii]

BlackRock has launched a new thematic global equity ETF in the US providing exposure to companies that are developing infrastructure and industrial solutions to support the environment.

The iShares Environmental Infrastructure and Industrials ETF (EFRA US) has been listed on Nasdaq with an expense ratio of 0.47%.

The ETF’s underlying reference is the FTSE Green Revenues Select Infrastructure and Industrials Index which selects its constituents from an initial universe of stocks with market capitalizations above $100 million that are listed in developed market countries, excluding South Korea.

The index screens for companies deriving at least 40% of their revenue from providing “Green” infrastructure and industrial solutions. Eligible activities must fall into one of 29 different micro-sectors that can be categorized into three themes: energy efficiency and emissions mitigation, pollution reduction, and land and resource optimization.

Constituents are weighted by float-adjusted market capitalization subject to a single stock cap of 6% and an aggregate cap of 45% on all stocks with weights above 4.5%.

As of 7 November, US-listed stocks accounted for nearly two-thirds (63.5%) of the total index weight with the next-largest country exposures being the UK (10.0%), Japan (9.2%), France (6.8%), and Canada (3.2%).

Stocks from the industrials sector make up over half (56.7%) of the index’s allocation, while companies classified to the utility sector account for another quarter (27.8%).

Notable positions included Xylem (7.1%), Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies (6.8%), Veolia Environ (6.6%), Albemarle (6.2%), and American Water Works (5.7%).

BlackRock (BLK), the world’s largest money manager, has been accused of “greenwashing” its investment activities in a report that claims the company has as much as $85bn (£62.1bn) invested in coal.

NGOs Reclaim Finance and Urgewald published a report on Wednesday that said BlackRock has $85bn of money invested in companies on the Global Coal Exit List. The list, compiled by German group Urgewald, details companies around the world that have some sort of exposure to the coal industry.

The report’s findings come a year after BlackRock chief executive and chairman Larry Fink wrote to clients saying sustainability would be the firm’s “new standard for investing.”

“There is no denying the direction we are heading,” Fink wrote in his annual letter. “Every government, company, and shareholder must confront climate change.”

Since then, BlackRock has ditched all its actively managed investments in companies that make more than 25% of their money from coal and added a raft of new “ESG” (environmental, social, and governance) fund options for clients to invest in. Investments in “sustainable” assets are up 41% on 2020, BlackRock says, and the company has pressed hundreds of companies to come up with green plans for the future.

However, Reclaim Finance and Urgewald said BlackRock wasn’t going far enough or fast enough. Lara Cuvelier, a sustainable investment campaigner at Reclaim Finance, said Fink’s letter amounted to “greenwashing” — the process of falsely making business seem more environmentally friendly than they really are.

“One year on, it’s hard to see Larry Fink’s sustainability commitment as anything other than greenwashing,” Cuvelier said in a statement.

“If he really wants BlackRock to be a climate leader instead of a climate pariah, he needs to start aligning green words with green deeds, and direct BlackRock’s awesome financial power towards a sustainable future.

“After the hottest year on record, the bare minimum for BlackRock is to get out of coal once and for all.”

Coal, when used as a fossil fuel, is one of the biggest contributors to climate change. BlackRock publicly pledged to stop investing in companies involved in thermal coal — one of the most polluting forms of coal — but critics say exclusions from the policy mean it captures only a fraction of the industry. Coal-fired power plants are exempt from the investment ban, for example. Reclaim Finance and Urgewald’s report estimates the ban covers just 17% of the coal industry.

“In order to effectively exclude the coal industry, BlackRock should drop all companies that are planning to expand existing or build new coal infrastructure,” said Katrin Ganswindt, finance campaigner at Urgewald.

“At the very least, companies with a coal share of revenue of 20% and a coal share of power production of 20% should be excluded from BlackRock's portfolios. Lastly, BlackRock needs to define a concrete phase-out date for all coal investments.”

BlackRock is the world’s largest money manager, with more than $7tn under management. About two thirds of that is managed through passive tracker funds, limiting BlackRock’s ability to sell-out based on climate criteria.

“Our conviction is that climate risk is investment risk,” BlackRock said in a statement. “We ask all companies to disclose how their business model will be compatible with the transition to a low-carbon economy. Where we do not see sufficient progress, we take voting action.”

BlackRock pointed to recent votes against firms like PGE, Uniper, and Fortum. A recent climate update said 244 “climate intensive” firms were at risk of BlackRock voting against them unless they made “significant progress on climate”.

Finance firms are facing increasing pressure from campaign groups over investments in polluting industries. Barclays (BARC.L) faced a successful pressure campaign from climate groups last year and activist organisation ShareAction recently launched a similar campaign against HSBC (HSBA.L).

A report by Morningstar in October found BlackRock voted against investor climate resolutions in 80% of case last year.

ESG-forward investing seems to be taking over the financial industry, but ex-BlackRock chief investment officer for sustainable investing Tariq Fancy warns that this is simply another form of greenwashing. In an opinion article, Fancy says that the Wall Street is “greenwashing the public with deadly distraction in sustainable investing practices” instead of getting to the heart of the issue: the rigged system fuelling climate change needs an overhaul.

Many would agree that the financial industry has come under a lot of pressure in recent months, especially in the wake of the pandemic, with the realisation of the consequences of continued ecological damage driving the sustainable investing push. ESG investing has become more popular than ever before with investors, with promising data of its outperformance over traditional funds in 2020.

There’s now been a slew of campaigns and initiatives all focused on “going green”, from a new platform dedicated to ESG-focused financial products launched by the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX), to multinational investment banking giant Goldman Sachs pledging to reach net-zero by 2030 in response to what its CEO David Solomon said was “no slowdown” in sustainable finance demand from its clients.

But Tariq Fancy, former CIO of sustainable investing at BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager who has since joined the Climate Action 100+ pact and made bold statements to “punish” high-emissions companies in its portfolio, says all of this amounts to nothing more than “merely PR”.

In truth, sustainable investing boils down to little more than marketing hype, PR spin and disingenuous promises from the investment community.

In essence, Wall Street is greenwashing the economic system and, in the process, creating a deadly distraction. I should know; I was at the heart of it.

“The financial services industry is duping the American public with its pro-environment, sustainable investing practices,” wrote Fancy.

“This multi-trillion dollar arena of socially conscious investing is being presented as something it’s not. In essence, Wall Street is greenwashing the economic system and, in the process, creating a deadly distraction. I should know; I was at the heart of it.”

While at BlackRock, Fancy led the firm’s push to incorporate ESG into its investments and championed the whole concept that what’s good for the planet was profitable. He says this is impossible – the system itself doesn’t allow for a real “cure” to the problem.

“Sadly, that’s all it is, a hopeful idea. In truth, sustainable investing boils down to little more than marketing hype, PR spin and disingenuous promises from the investment community,” he says, citing ESG products that contain fossil fuel majors and fast fashion polluters – in order to lift the fund’s performance – as clear instances of blatant greenwashing.

“Risk managers are focused on protecting their investment portfolios from potential damages done by a worsening climate rather than helping prevent that damage from occurring in the first place.”

We’re running out of time and need to accept the truth: To fix our system and curb a growing disaster, we need government to fix the rules.

Another problem is that these firms are getting away with it – because “claiming to be environmentally responsible is profitable”. But really doing something in favour of the climate, doesn’t necessarily bring the same monetary results.

“To advance real change in the environment simply doesn’t yield the same return.”

Fancy says that the real cure will have to be “won through the combined efforts of science and policy”, and he makes the analogy with fighting the coronavirus pandemic. What will make a real difference, in both cases, is top-down government action, he argues.

“I believe we are doing irreversible harm by stalling and greenwashing. And all in the name of profits. We’re running out of time and need to accept the truth: To fix our system and curb a growing disaster, we need government to fix the rules.”

Others failed to recognize the progress made such that companies had largely met the ask of the proposal,"" according to the BlackRock's report.

Some general examples included in the report were proposals that called for decommissioning fossil fuel assets, eliminating financing and insurance underwriting for fossil fuel projects, and a stop to fossil fuel exploration and development. ""Many of these more prescriptive proposals attracted lower levels of investor support more broadly,"" the report said.

""In keeping with our investment convictions, our view continues to be that the best economic outcomes for our clients will come through an orderly energy transition by companies that recognizes the needs of their consumers and other key stakeholders,"" BlackRock said in the report. ""In our work engaging with companies, and, where clients have tasked us with it, casting proxy votes, our work on climate-related issues remains unchanged in focusing on the material risks and opportunities that the energy transition poses.""

BlackRock said it supported diversity, equity and inclusion-related shareholder proposals where there were insufficient disclosures. But, as an example of it rebuffing a proposal, BlackRock said it did not support a recent proposal for McDonald's asking for a third-party civil rights audit. ""McDonald's currently provides clear, fulsome disclosures on their approach to DEI in relation to direct employees and other stakeholders on which they depend for their long-term success,"" the report said.

BlackRock will release how it voted on every board election, proposal and other issues during the 2021-2022 proxy year in August.

""This proxy season underscored our belief that a constructive stewardship approach contributes to companies making meaningful progress in their climate-related planning and disclosures, where this is a material financial risk and/or opportunity for them,"" the stewardship group said.

""But it also reinforced our long-held view that the pathway to decarbonization is difficult to predict and will not occur in a straight line. Consistent with that view, we have not supported certain climate shareholder proposals that are overly prescriptive or micromanage how companies should decarbonize.""",BlackRock supporting fewer environmental and social shareholder proposals

In his annual letter to CEOs , Fink said businesses, cities and countries that do not plan for a carbon-free future risked being left behind. He argued that the pursuit of long-term returns was the main driver behind climate policies, after being criticised for seeking to influence companies.

“Stakeholder capitalism is not about politics. It is not a social or ideological agenda. It is not ‘woke’,” he wrote. “We focus on sustainability not because we’re environmentalists, but because we are capitalists and fiduciaries to our clients.”

West Virginia’s treasurer said this week that the state’s Treasury investment board would no longer use a BlackRock fund, after the fund manager urged companies to cut their carbon emissions to net zero by 2050. The official said this would damage West Virginia’s economy.

In his Dear CEO letter, Fink wrote: “It is through effective stakeholder capitalism that capital is efficiently allocated, companies achieve durable profitability, and value is created and sustained over the long term. Make no mistake, the fair pursuit of profit is still what animates markets; and long-term profitability is the measure by which markets will ultimately determine your company’s success.”

After Fink wrote two years ago that climate risk was an investment risk and that the firm would put sustainability at the heart of its investment decisions, many companies set out plans to become carbon-neutral. BlackRock had previously been criticised for not pushing hard enough on the issue.

Last spring, BlackRock – which manages about $10tn (£7.4tn) in assets – reportedly threw its weight behind a shareholder campaign to oust several directors on the board of the US oil giant ExxonMobil. The coup launched by dissident hedge fund activists at Engine No 1 replaced two Exxon board members with its own candidates to help push the oil company towards a greener strategy.

Fink predicted in this year’s letter that “the next 1,000 unicorns won’t be search engines or social media companies, they’ll be sustainable, scalable innovators – startups that help the world decarbonise and make the energy transition affordable for all consumers”, adding that established companies should strive to do the same.

He said a “tectonic shift” had happened in recent years, with sustainable investments globally reaching $4tn.

Fink also said that companies had a moral responsibility to adapt to “a new world of work” that had been reshaped by the coronavirus pandemic. He said “that world is gone” – where companies expected workers to come to the office five days a week, mental health was rarely discussed in the workplace, and wages for those on low and middle incomes barely grew.","BlackRock’s Larry Fink: climate policies are about profits, not being ‘woke’"

Sustainability through Innovation.

Continuously enhancing driving pleasure and ambitious sustainability targets define the work of the BMW Group in shaping the individual mobility of the future. The company firmly believes that innovation is the key to progress in both areas. With more than 100 years of experience and extensive technological expertise, the BMW Group is rising to the challenge of developing attractive mobility solutions in harmony with climate protection, resource conservation, quality of life in urban environments and social responsibility. As part of the “Sustainability through Innovation 2022” event, the company is presenting a wide range of groundbreaking technologies, concepts and strategies that illustrate how innovative strength and visionary thinking can generate momentum for sustainable mobility.

New battery cell for the NEUE KLASSE models.

With the models of the NEUE KLASSE due to make their début in 2025, the BMW Group is poised to enter a new era in electromobility and for the first time use round battery cells, which are optimally adapted to the new architecture centred around all-electric drive systems. The innovative lithium-ion batteries for what will be the sixth generation of BMW eDrive technology will increase range by 30 percent and charging speed by around 20 percent. There will also be a reduction in CO 2 emissions in the production of the battery cells, while manufacturing costs for the entire high-voltage battery will be up to 50 percent lower compared with the current, fifth generation.

The new round cells measure 46 millimetres in diameter and will be manufactured in two different lengths. Depending on the model, they can be flexibly integrated into the available installation space in the vehicle underbody. To meet demand for battery cells for the NEUE KLASSE, the BMW Group will build two new battery cell factories with partners in Europe, China and the USMCA region.

BMW EfficientDynamics supports the transformation to electromobility.

More driving pleasure, lower emissions – this is the principle behind BMW EfficientDynamics, which has been driving progress in sustainability through continuous innovation since 2007. Along with the drive system, the technology package includes intelligent lightweight construction, reduced rolling resistance and optimised aerodynamics, all of which play a part in the transformation to electromobility. Current BMW models featuring pure electric drivetrains have been impressing media representatives in test drives, delivering outstanding energy consumption and range values and even undercutting or exceeding the official WLTP or EPA figures in some cases.

The NEUE KLASSE models will also benefit from BMW EfficientDynamics. This integrated approach to maximum efficiency influences development of the new vehicles and platforms from the very outset, not just in the drivetrain configuration, but also in the areas of design and material selection.

On the road to a circular economy and vegan interiors.

At the BMW Group, designers, material scientists and experts from other disciplines are working together on sustainable solutions for designing vehicle interiors and exteriors. The focus is on responsible procurement and processing of raw materials that is as CO 2 -free as possible, continuously increasing the proportion of secondary materials with the aim of achieving a complete circular economy, new recycling processes, increased use of natural fibres and the replacement of raw materials of animal origin.

The BMW Group plans to launch its first vehicles featuring completely vegan interiors in 2023. This is being made possible primarily through the development of innovative materials with leather-like properties. Replacing leather reduces the CO 2 emissions along the value chain for the respective interior components by around 85 percent.

Recycled fishing nets as a raw material for interior and exterior components.

In a first for the automotive industry, the models of the NEUE KLASSE due to be launched from 2025 onwards will feature trim parts made of plastic whose raw material contains around 30 percent recycled fishing nets and ropes. These waste materials from the maritime industry are proactively sourced at ports all around the world to ensure that they don’t end up being discarded in the sea. For numerous other materials – from steel and aluminium to plastic and glass, all the way to high-voltage batteries – new recycling processes are being developed and established in line with the principles of a circular economy. Through its work in the area of circular design, the BMW Group aims to ensure that end-of-life vehicles are available for use as a source of raw materials for new vehicles.

Sustainable materials, new aesthetic: Visionary seat design concepts.

The BMW Group is also presenting visionary seat design concepts for future BMW and MINI models at the event. The materials used are characterised by environmentally friendly manufacturing processes, full recyclability, groundbreaking aesthetics and uncompromising premium quality with an exceptional look and feel.

Digital tools for greater sustainability.

Digitalisation and the associated innovations are also making a significant contribution to continuously increasing sustainability in the supply chain and in the construction of BMW Group vehicles. This is evident in the cross-industry data network Catena-X and in generative design with new computer-assisted methods for the development of vehicle components.

BMW AG is one of the initiators of the Catena-X partner network, which, through the establishment of a networked database, is also laying the groundwork for the creation a circular economy and the consistent reduction of CO 2 emissions in the supply chain. Around a year after its launch, the alliance for the secure exchange of data across companies in the automotive industry is now presenting its first applications ready for testing in practice.

Breakthrough in the NEUE KLASSE: Generative design.

Within the BMW Group, digitalisation in the form of generative design is playing an increasingly important role in the efficient and resource-saving design of vehicle components. Using computer algorithms, designers and engineers can create complex component geometries that enable a significant reduction in material usage and weight that would not be possible with conventional methods.

Diverse concepts for sustainable urban mobility.

To increase sustainability in the use phase of its vehicles and at the same time promote the attractiveness of cities as living spaces for their residents, the BMW Group is examining the entire urban mobility ecosystem. In addition to the development of locally emission-free vehicles, this includes diverse concepts for sustainable mobility in urban areas.

Innovative round battery cells for NEUE KLASSE from 2025.

More performance, CO2-reduced production, significantly lower costs: BMW Group to use innovative round BMW battery cells in NEUE KLASSE from 2025.

The BMW Group is convinced that powerful, innovative, sustainably-produced battery cells will be key to the success of individual electromobility in the future. The company is set to launch a new era of e-mobility from 2025 with the models of its NEUE KLASSE – using newly-developed round battery cells optimised for the new architecture for the first time.

“The newly-developed sixth generation of our lithium-ion cells will bring a huge leap in technology that will increase energy density by more than 20 percent, improve charging speed by up to 30 percent and enhance range by up to 30 percent,” according to Frank Weber, member of the Board of Management of BMW AG responsible for Development. “We are also reducing CO 2 emissions from cell production by up to 60 percent. These are big steps for sustainability and customer benefits.”

“To meet our long-term needs, we will be building battery cell factories with our partners, each with an annual capacity of up to 20 GWh, at six locations in key markets for us: two in China, two in Europe and two in USMCA,” added Joachim Post, member of the Board of Management of BMW AG responsible for Purchasing and Supplier Network. “We have also reached agreement with our partners that they will use a percentage of secondary material for the raw materials lithium, cobalt and nickel, as well as utilising green power for production, to ensure CO 2 -reduced manufacturing.”

The BMW Group has already awarded contracts in the two-digit billion-euro range for production of the new BMW battery cells. By leveraging the comprehensive in-house expertise of the company’s own Battery Cell Competence Centre, the team from development, production and purchasing has been able to significantly reduce costs for the high-voltage battery, thanks to the new battery cell and new integration concept for battery technology developed by BMW.Based on current market assumptions, costs can be reduced by up to 50 percent, compared to the current fifth generation. The BMW Group has set itself the goal of bringing manufacturing costs for fully-electric models down to the same level as vehicles with state-of-the-art combustion-engine technology.

Technological advances: new cell format and enhanced cell chemistry

The battery cell is responsible for electric vehicles’ core properties of range, driving performance and charging time. For the sixth generation of BMW eDrive technology used in the NEUE KLASSE, the company has fundamentally refined the cell format and cell chemistry. With the new BMW round cell specially designed for the electric architecture of the NEUE KLASSE models, it will be possible to significantly increase the range of the highest-range model by up to 30 percent (according to WLTP).

The new BMW round cells come with a standard diameter of 46 millimetres and two different heights. Compared to the prismatic cells of the fifth BMW battery cell generation, the nickel content in the sixth-generation BMW round cells is higher on the cathode side, while the cobalt content is reduced. On the anode side, the silicon content will be increased. As a result, the cell’s volumetric energy density will improve by more than 20 percent.

The battery system plays a key role in the body structure of the NEUE KLASSE. Depending on the model, it can be flexibly integrated into the installation space to save space (“pack to open body”). The cell module level is thus eliminated.

The battery, drive train and charging technology in the NEUE KLASSE will also have a higher voltage of 800 volts. Among other things, this will optimise how energy is supplied to direct current high-power charging stations, which can achieve a much higher charging capacity with a current of up to 500 amperes – thus reducing the time it takes to charge the vehicle from 10 to 80 percent by up to 30 percent.

Battery cell factories in China, Europe and USMCA – each with total capacity of up to 20 GWh per year

To supply the battery cells needed for the NEUE KLASSE, the BMW Group has already awarded contracts in the two-digit billion-euro range for construction of battery cell factories to CATL and EVE Energy. Both partners will build two gigafactories in China and Europe. Each of the battery cell factories will have a total annual capacity of up to 20 GWh. Plans call for two more battery cell factories to be built in the North American free trade zone,

USMCA, for which the partners have not yet been nominated.

The three regions where the battery cell factories will be built will also benefit economically from the creation of new supply chains, new networks for subcontractors and new jobs.

CO 2 -reduced production using green power and secondary material

The BMW Group is particularly focused on keeping the carbon footprint and consumption of resources for production as low as possible, starting in the supply chain. Cell manufacturers will use cobalt, lithium and nickel that include a percentage of secondary material, i.e. raw materials that are not newly mined, but already in the loop, in production of battery cells. Combined with the commitment to use only green power from renewable energies for production of battery cells, the BMW Group will reduce the carbon footprint of battery cell production by up to 60 percent, compared to the current generation of battery cells.

Reuse of raw materials will be one of the success factors for e-mobility in the future. Circular loops reduce the need for new raw materials, lower the risk of infringing environmental and social standards in the supply chain and generally result in significantly lower CO 2 emissions. That is why the long-term goal of the BMW Group is to use fully recyclable battery cells. In China, the company is currently creating a closed loop for reuse of the raw materials nickel, lithium and cobalt from high-voltage batteries, thus laying the cornerstone of a ground-breaking material cycle.

The cobalt and lithium used as raw materials for the new generation of BMW battery cells will be sourced from certified mines. This means the company retains full transparency over extraction methods and, in this way, can ensure responsible mining. The sourcing of both raw materials from certified mines takes place either directly through the BMW Group or via the battery cell manufacturer.

The BMW Group has been actively involved for many years in initiatives to develop standards for responsible raw material extraction and promote compliance with environmental and social standards for raw material extraction through certification of mines. In this way, the company is also making itself less technologically, geographically and geopolitically dependent on individual resources and suppliers.

Development of future BMW battery cells at in-house competence centres

The BMW Group is constantly working to further develop energy storage systems. For instance, its sixth-generation battery technology also offers the option of using cathodes made of lithium iron phosphate (LFP) for the first time. This means the critical raw materials cobalt and nickel can then be avoided entirely in the cathode material. In parallel, the BMW Group is also pushing forward with development of all-solid-state batteries (ASSBs). The company aims to have high-voltage batteries of this type ready for series introduction by the end of the decade. The BMW Group will present a demonstrator vehicle with this technology on board well before 2025.

The BMW Group has been systematically building expertise in the field of battery cell technology since 2008. Since 2019, this know-how has been concentrated at the BMW Group’s Battery Cell Competence Centre (BCCC) in Munich. The BCCC spans the entire value chain – from research and development to battery cell design to manufacturability.

To ensure innovations in battery cell technology are put into practice quickly and efficiently, the BMW Group relies on a network of around 300 partners, with cooperation between established companies, startups and colleges, among others.

The knowledge gained in this way will be validated at the new Cell Manufacturing Competence Centre (CMCC) in Parsdorf, near Munich, which will begin commissioning near-standard production of samples in late 2022 for the future BMW battery cell generation to be used in the NEUE KLASSE from 2025 onwards.

The pilot line at the competence centre will make it possible to analyse and fully understand the cell production process under near-standard conditions. This will help enable future suppliers produce cells to specifications and according to their own expertise – thus further optimising battery cell production with regard to quality, output and costs.

NEUE KLASSE will make major contribution to sales volumes

With a fast-growing product lineup and high demand, the BMW Group aims to have more than two million fully-electric vehicles on the roads by the end of 2025.

The all-electric NEUE KLASSE will make a significant contribution to BMW Group sales volumes from mid-decade. The NEUE KLASSE has the potential to further accelerate the market penetration of e-mobility: This means 50 percent of the BMW Group’s global sales could already come from fully-electric vehicles before 2030.

The MINI brand will have an exclusively all-electric product range by the early 2030s, while Rolls-Royce will also be an all-electric brand from 2030. All future new models from BMW Motorrad in the field of urban mobility will likewise be fully electric.

BMW Efficient Dynamics.

A new dimension in tangible efficiency.

With the introduction of its EfficientDynamics technology package back in 2007, the BMW Group presented a concept that remains unrivalled in the automotive industry to this day. It centred on consistently reducing fuel consumption – and thereby CO 2 emissions – on the one hand, while steadily increasing driving pleasure on the other.

With BMW EfficientDynamics, every aspect of vehicle development is measured in terms of how it can contribute to optimising sustainability. In addition to all aspects of the drive system, it applies to energy and heat management, aerodynamics, optimisation of rolling resistance and weight reduction through intelligent lightweight construction.

With this continuously evolving technology package, the company succeeded in reducing the CO 2 emissions of its brands’ vehicle fleets by 53 percent between 1995 and 2020. The BMW Group has now set itself the target of cutting CO 2 emissions per kilometre driven for its vehicles in the use phase by a further 50 percent by 2030.

The company’s meticulous efforts are now paying off, especially in the transformation to electric drivetrains.

“The real ranges that the BMW i4 and BMW iX achieve compared to their rivals show that while others focus on brochure values, BMW delivers. This clearly demonstrates the effectiveness of our EfficientDynamics strategy: maximum efficiency that is tangible for our customers,” says Frank Weber, Member of the Board of Management, Development.

When determining the range and energy consumption values for the models in its electric fleet, the BMW Group focuses on realistic, customer-representative vehicle configurations and achieves impressive values through maximum efficiency.

By consistently focusing on the customer, the BMW Group – unlike many of its competitors – designs its vehicles for ranges that correspond to real-world use cases as opposed to just looking good on paper. This is also confirmed in independent tests conducted with the BMW i4 and BMW iX under real conditions by various trade publications.

Battery electric vehicles from the BMW Group perform exceptionally well in long-term tests conducted by trade media, delivering impressive ranges that in some cases even exceed the official values determined in the WLTP test cycle. In the test conducted by US trade magazine Edmunds, the BMW iX xDrive50 exceeded the official EPA range estimate by almost 100 kilometres (energy consumption (combined): 21.1 – 20.7 kWh/100 km; CO 2 emissions (combined): 0 g/km according to WLTP; NEDC values: – ). It also set a new range record for electric vehicles in the Sports Activity Vehicle (SAV) segment tested by the magazine.

The BMW i4 M50 also performed well (energy consumption (combined): 22.5 – 18.0 kWh/100 km; CO 2 emissions (combined): 0 g/km according to WLTP; NEDC values: – ) on the Edmunds test track, delivering a real-world range that exceeded the EPA value by more than 65 kilometres.

Everyday consumption data from realistic use cases and test vehicle configurations.

When designing new vehicle models, the developers at the BMW Group focus on the actual usage behaviour of customers. These use cases include dynamic driving situations, long-distance journeys, driving in extreme temperatures and towing a trailer.

When it comes to reducing vehicle consumption, the BMW Group places a very high focus on optimizing additional vehicle options and equipment. This not only results in small spreads with different configurations of optional equipment. It also enables vehicles with customer-representative equipment (so-called “BestFit”) to stand out in the competitive environment with very good energy consumption

figures.

“Efficiency is the true achievement.”

Recent test reports in national and international publications confirm the effectiveness of this approach. Focus online magazine measured average energy consumption of 21.2 kWh per 100 kilometres for the BMW iX xDrive50 for urban, interurban and motorway driving with a dynamic driving style, 0.1 kWh below the official range measured in the WLTP test cycle. In its Ecotest, ADAC recorded average energy consumption of just 20.4 kWh per 100 kilometres. The range of 610 kilometres achieved by the testers also exceeded the maximum value from the WLTP test cycle. The independent experts attribute this primarily to the high efficiency of the electric motors and the intelligent energy management, which, among other things, enables adaptive recuperation: “The enormous range achieved by the BMW iX in the ADAC Ecotest is thanks to the efficiency of the drive system.”

The fact that the BMW iX xDrive50 manages the energy stored in its high-voltage battery so efficiently, even under demanding test conditions, also impressed the authors from UK consumer website Which?. They described it as “the only car we’ve tested since 2017 to deliver its official WLTP range” in practice. The highly integrated drive units, intelligent lightweight construction and optimised aerodynamics are decisive factors in this regard. As a result, the BMW iX xDrive50 has the lowest energy consumption of all vehicles in its segment that Which? has tested. The testers conclude: “Efficiency, not range, is BMW’s true achievement.”

The NEUE KLASSE will benefit from BMW EfficientDynamics.

The BMW EfficientDynamics strategy will continue to influence all aspects of new models in the future, optimising efficiency from the ground up during the use phase. This process begins in the early development stages for new vehicles or platforms such as the all-electric architecture of the NEUE KLASSE.

In addition to a new, highly efficient modular drive system from what will be the sixth generation of BMW eDrive technology, aerodynamics optimised for the battery platform will not only increase the efficiency of the NEUE KLASSE models, but also serve as an enabler for a distinctive new BMW design. Other important factors are the weight savings achieved through intelligent lightweight construction using new materials, an energy-efficient vehicle electrical system, a specific braking system for electric vehicles and the reduction of rolling resistance through improved wheel bearings, as well as close cooperation with tyre developers to achieve the best possible Class A+ tyres.

Circularity and materials.

Priority for secondary raw materials and natural fibres, BMW to offer vegan vehicle interiors for the first time in 2023.

What is a car made of? The BMW Group is finding innovative answers to this question through fundamental research, detailed development and a clear focus on sustainability. The emphasis is on raw materials that can be procured and processed as CO 2 -free as possible, continuously increasing the proportion of secondary materials with the aim of achieving a complete circular economy, new recycling processes, increased use of natural fibres and the replacement of raw materials of animal origin.

At IAA Mobility 2021, the BMW Group presented the BMW i Vision Circular, a look ahead to a car that is designed according to circular economy principles across the board and defines sustainability and luxury for the year 2040. Together, designers, material scientists and experts from other disciplines are looking to the long-term future, developing innovative ideas that combine sustainability with the highest functional quality and an inspiring new aesthetic. Along with the material properties, aspects such as raw material procurement and production methods are of essential importance in the design process.

On the market from 2023: BMW and MINI models with vegan interiors.

The BMW Group plans to launch its first vehicles featuring completely vegan interiors in 2023. This is being made possible primarily through the development of innovative materials with leather-like properties. It will also be possible to use these materials for steering wheel surfaces, which must fulfil demanding criteria when it comes to feel, premium appearance and wear resistance. Fully vegan interiors will be available for both BMW and MINI models for the first time from 2023. The BMW Group is thus serving the demand for vegan and leather-free interiors, which is set to increase further in the near future, especially in the US, China and Europe.

The reduction of CO 2 emissions over the entire life cycle of a vehicle is the central goal of the BMW Group on the road to climate neutrality, which is to be achieved by 2050 at the latest. Material selection has a key role to play in achieving this goal. Replacing raw materials of animal origin makes a significant contribution to increasing sustainability in vehicle production. The introduction of a new surface material for steering wheels will see the proportion of vehicle components that contain traces of raw materials of animal origin fall to less than one percent in the respective BMW and MINI vehicles. As a result, these materials will now only be found in areas that are not visible to the customer, for example in various waxy substances such as gelatine used in protective coatings, lanolin in paints, tallow as an additive in elastomers and beeswax as a flux for paints.

The BMW Group has for a long time been offering various fabric alternatives to leather. Now, for the first time, it is possible to offer a suitable substitute for leather for the most important interface between driver and vehicle. The steering wheel surfaces must fulfil demanding criteria when it comes to appearance, wear resistance and durability. “With a steering wheel made from a high-quality vegan surface material, we are fulfilling the wishes of our customers who do not want to make any compromises in terms of look, feel and functionality. The innovative material withstands wear and tear caused by abrasion, perspiration and moisture and has all the desirable properties of leather,” says Uwe Köhler, Head of Development Body, Exterior Trim, Interior at the BMW Group. The only distinguishing feature of the new material will be a new grain effect on the steering wheel rim.

Leather-free surfaces reduce CO 2 e emissions by 85 percent.

The fact that there is now a high-quality vegan surface material with equivalent properties to the real leather previously used in the production of steering wheels represents another major step towards CO 2 reduction. The new steering wheel surface material reduces CO 2 e emissions along the value chain by around 85 percent compared to leather. Up to now, most of the emissions produced, around 80 percent, were in the form of methane gas from cattle rearing. The remaining 20 percent was accounted for by processing of the cowhide, which is highly energy- and water-intensive.

Climate neutrality and a circular economy are the top priorities.

To achieve the goal of climate neutrality, the BMW Group is relying on the use of green electricity in production and in the supply chain, a consistently increased proportion of secondary materials and natural raw materials, highly efficient electric motors and combustion engines and a high recycling rate in line with the principles of a circular economy.

It’s all in the detail: The floor mats for various models are made from mono-material, thus avoiding material mixes that are difficult to recycle. As a result, the BMW Group saves around 23,000 tonnes of CO 2 and an additional 1,600 tonnes of waste every year, since the recycled floor mats and waste material are also reused within the production process.

Research and development in the field of secondary raw materials and sustainable materials are a top priority. Future vehicle generations will offer other attractive alternatives to leather. The BMW Group is working with start-up companies to develop innovative bio-based materials. Compared to the synthetic leathers previously used, these result in around 45 percent lower CO 2 emissions. MirumTM, which is 100 percent bio-based and petroleum-free, has the potential to mimic all the properties of traditional leather. Another new material, DeserttexTM, is made from pulverised cactus fibres with a bio-based polyurethane matrix. With these materials, replacing raw materials of animal origin can be combined with a significant reduction in CO 2 .

New materials, new aesthetic: Visionary seat design concepts.

With visionary seat concepts, BMW Group Design presents ideas for concrete applications using other innovative materials and production methods that contribute to lower CO 2 emissions and increased use of secondary materials, while at the same time establishing a new, high-quality interior aesthetic for the cars of the future. Two seat concepts each for vehicles from the MINI and BMW brands are featured.

Seat surfaces are a central element in the design of a vehicle interior and are of significant importance when it comes to the customer’s perception of the ambience. The design process therefore considers the look and feel, aesthetic impact and consistently high quality and tries to balance these aspects with resource-saving production and maximum recyclability of the material. Exciting colour combinations and surprising surface textures are ushering in a new lifestyle and luxury experience that is strongly influenced by an awareness of sustainability. In addition, efforts to conserve resources and reduce CO 2 emissions are driving innovation in the areas of design and material selection.

MINI is consistently focusing on vegan interiors for its next model generation. New materials and processing techniques make it possible to combine the premium character of the brand and its customers with significantly increased sustainability. With the So Soft seat concept, designers demonstrate how high-quality, colourful and comfortable a leather alternative can be. The velour used for the surfaces has a pleasant feel and offers exceptional comfort. The extremely durable material also comes in a wide range of colours, thus contributing to the interior personalisation options that MINI typically offers. Along with a significantly reduced carbon footprint, the development goal is complete recyclability of the material used. The raw material is recycled fibres, which are processed to create a mono-material for the entire seat surface and can therefore be recycled separately.

A mono-material that is fully recyclable is also used for the surfaces of the 3D Knit seat concept. A special manufacturing process also contributes to the sustainable character of the concept. The surface material is created using a resource-saving 3D knitting method that generates almost no production waste and is less time-consuming than conventional manufacturing processes. It is also produced in one piece, lending it a high-quality appearance with no seams. The fabric created using the 3D knitting method offers a high level of comfort and a particularly modern aesthetic.

With the seat concepts created for BMW cars, BMW Group Design presents several innovative materials used side by side, which can thus be analysed together and compared. The Infinite Loop seat concept is characterised by the consistent use of recycled material. Textile waste, which is processed into a synthetic yarn, is used to produce the material for the seat surfaces. This manufacturing process uses around 98 percent less water than when using cotton and reduces CO 2 emissions by around 80 percent compared to the conventional processing of polyester.

The solid backrest elements of the Infinite Loop seat concept can be made from leftover materials from the plastics industry or, as part of a complete circular economy, from the seating foam from end-of-life vehicles. In addition, composite materials made from dust and polystyrene waste can be used for resource-saving production of the seat backrests.

The Grown Innovation seat concept combines synthetic textiles made from 100 percent recycled material with natural fibres and a new type of biomaterial obtained from bacterial nanocellulose. The biomaterial, which is created in a laboratory process over the course of several weeks, forms the basis for a plastic-free, non-animal textile material with a high-quality surface finish and long service life. Another component of the surfaces developed for the Grown Innovation seat concept consists of a synthetic textile material produced using a 3D printing process. The additive manufacturing process does not generate any production waste and offers designers almost unlimited freedom when it comes to designing shapes and colours for vehicle interiors.

The upper section of the seat backrest – a possible alternative to the wood surfaces conventionally used in cars – consists of a composite material made from fast-growing plant fibres, which are characterised by a particularly favourable carbon footprint from cultivation to processing, and a protein-based binding agent. The material can be processed efficiently and in a variety of geometries and has a high-quality grain.

Renewable raw materials and natural fibres: Reduced weight, negative carbon footprint.

The BMW Group is already using renewable raw materials, natural fibres and other bio-based materials in its vehicles – for example in door trim panels or in the substructure of the centre armrest for the new BMW 7 Series. The use of natural raw materials such as hemp, kenaf and flax minimises the use of materials and reduces weight by up to 50 percent compared to conventional materials. Natural materials also come into the CO 2 calculation with a negative value, since the plants used can absorb CO 2 and release oxygen during the growth phase.

The BMW i3, launched in 2013, demonstrated how much the use of natural materials contributes to a holistic concept for sustainability along with electromobility, intelligent lightweight construction and the use of recycled raw materials. The natural, environmentally friendly materials used in its interior also meet the highest quality standards expected for a premium car in the long term. Based on this experience, the BMW Group continues to work on the development of other possible applications for natural materials and a wide range of uses in production vehicles. The door trim panels of the BMW i3 are made from kenaf fibres harvested from malva plants, which retain their distinctive natural structure when processed. Eucalyptus wood from certified plantations in Europe is used as the raw material for parts of the instrument panel. The leather in the interior of the BMW i3 is naturally tanned using an extract of olive leaves. The natural materials also contribute to the BMW i3’s excellent eco-balance, and their use in visible areas of the interior is a progressive design feature.

Components constructed from renewable plant fibres have also proven their worth in motorsport. Swiss cleantech company Bcomp produced a flax cooling shaft for the BMW iFE.20 driven in Formula E. Some carbon components in BMW M Motorsport touring cars are being replaced by reinforcement solutions made from natural fibre composites. BMW i Ventures, the venture capital firm of the BMW Group, has invested in Bcomp and agreed on a development collaboration.

Revolution in the car industry: Parts made from recycled fishing nets.

In a first for the automotive industry, the models of the New Class due to be launched from 2025 onwards will feature trim parts made of plastic whose raw material contains around 30 percent recycled fishing nets and ropes. This raw material is proactively sourced at ports all around the world to ensure that it doesn’t end up being discarded in the sea.

In an exclusive recycling process, waste material from the maritime industry is used to produce trim parts suitable for the exterior and interior of future vehicles. The resulting components have an approximately 25 percent lower carbon footprint than their counterparts made from conventionally manufactured plastics.

Conserving resources, reducing the carbon footprint, avoiding ocean pollution.

The BMW Group is working with different approaches to use plastic waste from the maritime industry as a raw material for vehicle components in order to conserve valuable resources and reduce CO 2 emissions. This form of recycling makes it possible to reduce the need for petroleum-based primary plastics and at the same time counteract ocean pollution.

Recycled nylon waste forms the basis for a synthetic yarn from which the floor mats in the BMW iX and the new BMW X1, for example, are made. This material, known as ECONYL, is made from fishing nets recovered from the ocean as well as worn floor coverings and residual waste from plastics production.

Only at the BMW Group: Maritime plastic waste used to produce visible trim parts.

In a new initiative, the BMW Group is taking the recycling of maritime plastic waste a step further. After separation, fishing nets and ropes undergo an innovative process that produces plastic granules. While recycled maritime plastic has so far only been used in the automotive industry in the form of fibres for new vehicle components, this recycled material is now also suitable for the injection moulding process for the first time. The raw material for the components manufactured in this way can consist of around 30 percent maritime plastic waste.

This creates additional application possibilities for recycled plastics. The components manufactured using the injection moulding process are trim parts that will be used in both non-visible and visible areas of the exterior and interior of the New Class models from 2025. Overall, the BMW Group has set itself the target of increasing the proportion of secondary materials in the thermoplastics used in new vehicles from currently around 20 percent to an average of 40 percent by 2030.

Design as a starting point for CO 2 reduction and circularity.

The BMW Group currently manufactures its vehicles using almost 30 percent recycled and reusable materials. The “secondary first” approach aims to gradually increase this figure to 50 percent. In this context, it is crucial that the quality, safety and reliability of the materials comply with the same high standards as those existing for primary materials. The BMW Group takes a holistic view of sustainability and evaluates the carbon footprint of each individual material used in the interior and exterior.

The BMW i Vision Circular shows how a car can be designed with a consistent focus on the principles of the circular economy. It clearly illustrates how resource conservation begins with vehicle design. The overriding design aim for this Vision Vehicle was to optimise it for closed-loop material cycles. This involves consistently reducing the number of components, material groups and surface finishes. In addition to bio-based raw materials, the BMW i Vision Circular primarily uses materials that have already gone through a product life cycle and are 100 percent recyclable.

Closed-loop recycling: The vehicle as a source of raw materials.

Circular design aims to ensure that end-of-life vehicles are available for use as a source of raw materials for new vehicles. Recyclability is optimised primarily through a reduced variety of materials. The use of mono-materials contributes significantly to simplified recycling and improved purity of secondary raw materials. This applies to textiles as well as to plastics and metal alloys.

The BMW Group has been a pioneer in the field of vehicle dismantling and recycling processes for around two decades. The company is committed to establishing a circular economy within the automotive industry, especially for steel, aluminium, glass and plastics, and is working on concepts for automated sorting of raw materials and efficient dismantling processes. In a pilot project with chemical company BASF and recycling and environmental services provider ALBA, the BMW Group is exploring possible conditions and recycling technologies for the establishment of a material cycle for plastics that would enable an end to the use of crude oil as a raw material.

A circular economy for vehicle windows is also to be created by 2030. Consistent dismantling, sorting and reuse of automotive glass could reduce CO 2 emissions in window production by up to 30 percent compared to using new material.

Plastics: Increased use of recycled materials and bio-based raw materials.

New BMW and MINI vehicles contain around 300 kilogrammes of plastic. Around 95 percent of these plastics come from components that are sourced from suppliers and assembled at BMW Group plants.

Depending on the model, recycled material currently accounts for up to 20 percent of the thermoplastics used in a new vehicle. The BMW Group has set itself the target of increasing the proportion of recycled material to an average of 40 percent by 2030. Some plastic components are already made from 100 percent secondary material. The increased use of secondary raw materials not only leads directly to the conservation of resources, but also makes a significant contribution to reducing CO 2 emissions in the supply chain. Switching from primary to secondary materials reduces CO 2 emissions in the manufacture of thermoplastic components by 50 to 80 percent. Another way to reduce the carbon footprint in the supply chain is to use bio-based plastics and plastics reinforced with natural fibres such as cellulose, hemp, wood or bamboo.

Steel and aluminium: Low-CO 2 production, increased use of secondary raw materials.

For the manufacture of steel and aluminium components, the aim is to continuously reduce CO 2 emissions in the production of materials and make greater use of secondary materials. From 2025 onwards, the BMW Group will source steel from a Swedish manufacturer that uses hydrogen and electricity from renewable sources for production. Agreement has also been reached with another supplier for the procurement of steel from CO 2 -reduced production, which means that from 2025, more than 40 percent of requirements for vehicle production at the European BMW Group plants can be covered in this way. As a result, CO 2 emissions can be reduced by around 400,000 tonnes annually. CO 2 -reduced production processes are also being agreed with steel suppliers in the US and China.

At the same time, the proportion of secondary raw materials in steel components is to be gradually increased from the current average of around 25 percent. Depending on the alloy, between 50 and 80 percent of the CO 2 emissions in the production process could be avoided in this way.

The BMW Group has been sourcing aluminium produced using electricity generated from solar energy since February 2021. The light metal produced with the help of solar power comes from the United Arab Emirates. A long-term increase in deliveries of aluminium produced using green electricity is planned, with the aim of reducing CO 2 emissions in this area by a total of around 2.5 million tonnes by 2030. From 2024 onwards, all cast aluminium wheels sourced by the BMW Group will be produced using only green electricity. Regeneratively generated energy is used both in the energy-intensive electrolysis when producing aluminium and when casting the wheels.

Some aluminium components already contain up to 50 percent secondary raw materials, with the figure set to rise to 70 percent in the cast aluminium wheels for the future generation of the MINI Countryman. The use of secondary aluminium instead of the primary raw material will lead to a reduction of 75 to 85 percent in CO 2 emissions associated with production.

CO 2 -free production, second use and recycling of high-voltage batteries.

With the ramp-up of electromobility, resource-saving production of high-voltage batteries is increasingly coming into focus. The BMW Group has committed all suppliers of battery cells for the current fifth and future sixth generation of BMW eDrive technology to using 100 percent green electricity.

The second use and recycling of high-voltage batteries from electric vehicles were included in the holistic concept for sustainability at an early stage. The BMW Group has been involved in various initiator projects for the further use and recycling of high-voltage batteries since 2013. Prominent examples include the battery storage systems at the BMW Group plant in Leipzig and at the ferry terminal in Hamburg. The reusability of high-voltage batteries after a long car life as stationary power storage devices and as a means of keeping the public energy grid stable was first demonstrated with the début of the BMW i3 in 2013.

At the same time, the BMW Group is working with various partners to promote recycling and the establishment of closed-loop material cycles (circularity) for battery cells. By the time substantial numbers of end-of-life vehicles have been returned, the most suitable process will have been industrialised. There is still no significant number of old high-voltage batteries available, since the the BMW Group designs these for the life of the vehicle and the oldest of them are only nine years old.

The proportion of secondary raw materials used in current BMW high-voltage batteries is increasing. Going forward, the mix of recycling and further use will also depend on raw material prices for battery cells. It is not yet foreseeable how the situation will evolve, which is why the BMW Group is pursuing both strands.Together with German recycling specialist Duesenfeld, the BMW Group has developed a process that aims to achieve a recycling rate of more than 95 percent – including graphite and electrolytes. In China, the BMW Brilliance Automotive joint venture (BBA) has established a closed loop for reuse of the raw materials nickel, lithium and cobalt from high-voltage batteries. The raw materials obtained in this way are used in production of new battery cells for the BMW Group. The closed-loop material cycle conserves resources and reduces CO 2 emissions by around 70 percent compared to using newly extracted primary material.

Digital tools for greater sustainability in design, development and production.

Catena-X and generative design.

The cross-industry data network Catena-X and generative design with new computer-assisted method for the development of vehicle components show how digitalisation can accelerate progress towards sustainable mobility. Digital tools and the associated innovations are also making a significant contribution to continuously increasing sustainability in the supply chain and in the design of BMW Group vehicles.

BMW AG is one of the initiators of the Catena-X partner network, which, through the establishment of a networked database, is also laying the groundwork for the creation a circular economy and the consistent reduction of CO 2 emissions in the supply chain. Around a year after its launch, the alliance for the secure exchange of data across companies in the automotive industry is now presenting its first applications ready for testing in practice. Within the BMW Group, digitalisation in the form of generative design is playing an increasingly important role in the efficient and resource-saving design of vehicle components. Using computer algorithms, designers and engineers can create complex component geometries that enable a significant reduction in material usage and weight, and in some cases even deliver improved or completely new functionality that would not be possible with conventional methods.

Go-ahead for the first practical applications: Catena-X.

Catena-X enables the secure and anonymous exchange of data between automotive manufacturers, suppliers and IT companies. More than 1,000 companies and institutions are now part of the network – including automotive manufacturers, software companies, suppliers, equipment manufacturers, dealer associations, universities and research institutes. Small and medium-sized companies can also join Catena-X. All participants benefit from standardised access to information and data, which optimises efficiency in industry-specific cooperation and accelerates company processes. Digital images of vehicles that can be retrieved on the digital platform can help to develop innovative business processes and service offerings more quickly and efficiently.

In addition to the benefits of greater efficiency in the supply chain, Catena-X participants can expect more efficient quality and logistics management as well as greater transparency in terms of sustainably reduced CO 2 emissions at all stages of the value chain. Alongside the ramp-up of electromobility, progress in reducing CO 2 emissions and conserving resources in the supply chain is the decisive factor in achieving the ambitious sustainability targets that the BMW Group has set itself. The network enables the companies involved in Catena-X to manage their carbon footprint just as precisely as conventional business figures relating to purchasing volumes, production capacities, sales data, revenue and profits. A common set of rules and standardised calculation methods coordinated with relevant NGOs lay the foundation that will allow the product carbon footprint (PCF) of each individual component to be specified with real data instead of average values in the future. This results in credible and transparent reporting on the achievement of sustainability goals in the supply chain and in vehicle production.

Catena-X also enables vehicle components to be tracked throughout their entire product life cycle – from raw material procurement to recycling. With this data, the recycling of components can be planned much more precisely. Which raw materials are required? What secondary materials are available? With Catena-X, it will be possible to answer these kinds of questions in real time in the future, thus facilitating the transformation of supply chains into material cycles. In addition to the environmental benefits, the economic benefits of a circular economy can also be precisely quantified. Along with financial savings potential, the databases will also provide information about improvements in the carbon footprint associated with the use of secondary materials.

Breakthrough in the NEUE KLASSE: Generative design.

Digital processes are increasing energy, resource and cost efficiency in the development and production of vehicle components. Generative design is rapidly gaining importance at the BMW Group as a method for the automated development of vehicle components. The design of components using computer algorithms is expected to be established as a standard method by 2025. Around 20 percent of all vehicle components could potentially be developed and designed using this digital technology. For the models of the NEUE KLASSE, generative methods will be employed for the first time to develop structural components such as the substructure of the rear seat system, for example.

Generative design enables the construction of components with complex geometries and optimal use of materials. Their weight is up to 50 percent lower than conventionally developed components. Algorithms from the fields of quantum computing and artificial intelligence can be used for particularly demanding tasks, thereby significantly accelerating the design of components.

The BMW i8 Roadster launched in 2017 was the first production vehicle to use a component developed with the aid of generative design. The aluminium mountings for connecting the convertible top to the body of the open plug-in hybrid sports car were designed using this method and then produced in a 3D printing process.

Urban mobility.

Diverse concepts for sustainable mobility in the city.

As part of its holistic approach to sustainability across the entire value chain, the BMW Group is developing not only locally emission-free vehicles, but also diverse concepts for future-oriented mobility in urban areas. To increase sustainability in the use phase and at the same time promote the attractiveness of cities as living spaces for their residents, the company is examining the entire urban mobility ecosystem. The aim is to promote acceptance of sustainable mobility solutions and to improve the transport infrastructure. This affects all areas of individual mobility and especially urban areas, where the changes in mobility originate and where they are particularly necessary.

Cities worldwide are faced with the task of counteracting the increasing densification of living and transport areas. The BMW Group is convinced that these challenges can be met with the help of innovations that offer concrete solutions against pollutant and noise emissions, traffic jams and the shortage of public space. These innovative solutions help cities to meet the mobility needs of their residents in an efficient, attractive and sustainable way, while ensuring quality of life in the urban environment.

For three decades, the BMW Group has been working with cities, universities, companies, associations, politicians and society in general on solutions for the transformation of urban mobility towards more sustainability. In cooperation with these partners, studies for the analysis of mobility needs, visions for the city of the future, concrete concepts and collaborative projects for the transformation of urban mobility area are being created. The aim is to ensure an efficient and safe flow of traffic for road users such as commuters and at the same time to guarantee a high quality of life and recreational spaces in the urban area.

Four lighthouse cities and numerous other partnerships.

In the four lighthouse cities of Munich, Rotterdam, Beijing and Los Angeles, as well as in Berlin and Hamburg, urban test laboratories for innovation in the fields of electromobility and charging infrastructure, multimodal transport, autonomous driving and digital solutions for optimising road safety and traffic flow are being created. There, concepts for locally emission-free, safe and efficient mobility come to maturity, which are practically implemented, tested and scaled in pilot projects in order to then be transferred to other cities.

The BMW Group is also involved in intelligent traffic management initiatives to reduce CO 2 emissions. The New Mobility Berlin project initiated by the BMW Group has been developing solutions since 2016 to achieve balance between the shortage of space, changing space requirements and mobility needs in a growing city. The project, executed in cooperation with the city administration, TU Berlin and the local community, creates convenient, sustainable options for inner-city mobility and is continuously being developed.

The expansion of the digital mobility-as-a-service platform FREE NOW into a multimobility app promotes the linking of different modes of transport. FREE NOW provides access to almost 180,000 vehicles in more than 150 European cities – including eScooters, car sharing, taxis and private hire vehicles – and supports the increasing integration of local public transport.

Convenient charging solutions and digital services: Promotion of electromobility requires an attractive ecosystem.

To promote locally emission-free mobility in urban areas, the BMW Group is involved not only in the development of attractive vehicles with electrified drives, but also in the field of public infrastructure for e-mobility. Acceptance of electromobility is being actively promoted through a large number of projects intended to make this infrastructure more efficient and transparent and its use more convenient and attractive. With the public charging offering from BMW Charging and MINI Charging, users register just once to gain access to more than 375,000 public charge points from around 1,000 charging infrastructure operators in Europe alone at attractive rates. Throughout Europe, all BMW Charging and MINI Charging customers charge with 100% green electricity. The BMW Group also has a stake in Digital Charging Solutions GmbH, which develops digital charging solutions for automotive manufacturers and fleet operators. The integration of these charging solutions into the vehicle’s operating system makes it particularly easy and convenient to use public charging stations.

The Charge & Repark project supports the efficient use of public charging stations. The project, initiated by the BMW Group in Rotterdam, includes a digital app that notifies customers as soon as charging is complete, motivating them to move their vehicle.

The BMW eDrive Zones digital service ensures that plug-in hybrid models automatically switch to all-electric driving mode upon entering “Umweltzonen” (environment zones) and other defined areas of a city. This service also helps local authorities to achieve sustainability targets. It was created as a pilot project in Rotterdam, one of the four lighthouse cities, and after a successful test phase was continuously rolled out to other urban areas. BMW eDrive Zones are now available in 148 European and three US cities.

CO 2 -free, space-saving, quiet and emotive: Electric single-track vehicles for sustainable urban mobility.

The BMW Group has more than 30 years of experience in the field of urban mobility concepts as well as outstanding development expertise in the field of electromobility.

With electric single-track vehicles, the company offers an ideal solution for locally emission-free, versatile and emotive mobility in inner cities. With significantly lower energy consumption compared to electric cars, they represent a highly efficient mobility solution. Their use reduces not only CO 2 and noise emissions, but also the need for traffic and parking spaces in urban areas.

BMW CE 04: The new electric star for the city.

TheBMW CE 04 has quickly become a symbol of progressive urban mobility. The purely electrically powered scooter from BMW Motorrad combines a future-oriented design with the latest drive technology and clever functionality. “The new electric star for the city,” as Oliver Zipse, CEO of BMW AG, describes it, is leading a silent revolution in urban two-wheeled mobility with an emission-free drive.

With a maximum output of 31 kW/42 hp, the BMW CE 04 has a powerful motor. From a standing start, it can sprint to 50 km/h in just 2.6 seconds. Its high-quality battery and charging technology supports a range of around 130 kilometres and quick replenishment of the energy supply. This enables day-to-day emission-free riding in the city, in an urban setting and for smaller-scale fun tours after work or at the weekend – with complete peace of mind. The standard equipment of the BMW CE 04 includes a cockpit featuring a 10.25 -inch colour screen with comprehensive connectivity functions.

BMW Motorrad Concept CE 02: A breath of fresh air for urban electromobility.

Like the BMW CE 04, all new BMW Motorrad models specifically designed for urban mobility will in future be powered purely by electricity. The BMW Group is working on extremely diverse creative approaches for the urban single-track vehicles of the future. The BMW Motorrad Concept CE 02 is a new and highly emotive mobility offering. With an innovative design language, new proportions and modern forms, the concept expresses a new facet of the brand character of BMW Motorrad. Thanks to the flat vehicle body, the centre of gravity of the BMW Motorrad Concept CE 02 is low and favourable when it comes to driving dynamics. At the same time, the large disc wheels and low seat height make it look inviting and confidence-inspiring.

The design and vehicle concept of the BMW Motorrad Concept CE 02 are based on the needs of a new target group: young people aged 16 and over who want to discover the joy of urban two-wheeled mobility for themselves for the first time. As a lightweight e-vehicle weighing about 120 kilogrammes, the BMW Motorrad Concept CE 02 is ideal for urban use, offering a high fun factor. The 11 kW of output and all the drive torque available directly from a standstill allow for fast acceleration at traffic lights and a top speed of 90 km/h.

Concept innovation in two forms: BMW Motorrad Vision AMBY and BMW i Vision AMBY.

Further proof of the broad range of creative solutions of the BMW Group for sustainable urban mobility is provided by a concept between bicycle and motorbike, which is presented in two versions. The BMW Motorrad Vision AMBY and BMW i Vision AMBY concepts interpret the fundamental idea of sustainable and at the same time emotive mobility in an urban setting based on two different facets. Both vehicles have an electric drive. While the BMW i Vision AMBY, a high-speed pedelec, requires constant pedalling in order to benefit from the assistance of the electric drive, the BMW Motorrad Vision AMBY is accelerated using the throttle grip and has footrests instead of pedals, as is typical of a motorcycle.

The word AMBY stands for “Adaptive Mobility”. The electric drive of both vehicles supports CO 2 -free riding with three speed levels for different types of roads. Its top speed is 25 km/h on cycle paths, 45 km/h on inner-city roads and 60 km/h on multi-lane roads and out of town.

Manual selection of the speed level is conceivable, as is detection of the road currently being travelled by means of geofencing technology, thereby allowing automatic adjustment of the top speed. As there is currently no legal basis for such a vehicle with an adaptive and modular speed concept, the BMW Motorrad Vision AMBY and BMW i Vision AMBY also set out to prompt the introduction of such legislation with the aim of paving the way for practical implementation of this innovative concept for sustainable urban mobility.

Recycling raw materials in a circular economy sense is intended to achieve the best possible resource efficiency.

The BMW Group continues to adhere to its ambitious sustainability targets and will reduce its CO 2 emissions by 40 per cent per vehicle by 2030 across the entire value chain compared to 2019. “We are consistently driving the issue of sustainability with our innovations,” says Thomas Becker, Head of Sustainability and Mobility at the BMW Group. “The current raw materials debate also validates our drive towards a circular economy. We want to make the best possible use of the raw materials in our end-of-life vehicles and recycle them in the production of new vehicles. We will continue to reduce CO 2 emissions and conserve natural resources through maximum energy and raw material efficiency.” An average of almost 30 per cent of BMW Group vehicles are already made from recycled and reused materials today, so-called “secondary raw materials”. In the longer term, the “Secondary First” approach aims to increase this figure to 50 per cent.

The BMW Group is the first German car manufacturer to join the “Science Based Targets initiative” (SBTi) “Business Ambition for 1.5°C”. This means the company’s path to climate neutrality is following a scientifically validated and transparent path that is in line with the most ambitious target of the Paris Climate Agreement. At the same time, the company is committed to the goal of complete climate neutrality across the entire value chain no later than 2050.

360-degree approach across the entire value chain

The BMW Group is consistently driving forward the electrification of its entire fleet. By 2030, at least one in two cars sold by the BMW Group is to be fully electric. The MINI and Rolls-Royce Motor Cars brands will offer only fully electric vehicles from the beginning of the 2030s. For example, the BMW Group aims to reduce CO 2 emissions per vehicle in the use phase by 50 per cent by 2030 compared to 2019.

“However, sustainability means much more for the BMW Group than merely building and selling electrically powered vehicles,” says Thomas Becker. “Only a comprehensive sustainability approach from resource to recycling actually achieves a bottom-line reduction of CO 2 emissions.” CO 2 savings in the supply chain are becoming enormously important as e-mobility ramps up, especially in view of the energy-intensive production of high-voltage batteries. Nevertheless, the BMW Group aims to buck the trend by reducing CO 2 emissions in the supply chain by 20 per cent by 2030, compared to 2019 values, and by as much as 80 per cent in production. The BMW Group’s global production network is already carbon net neutral thanks to selected offsetting initiatives.

Responsible sourcing of raw materials, conservation of natural resources

The BMW Group has set itself the goal of building the most sustainable supply chain in the entire automotive industry. The focus here is on reducing CO 2 emissions, protecting natural resources and complying with environmental and social standards.

As e-mobility ramps up, the raw materials needed specifically for e-drive components now come under the spotlight. The design principle for the current-generation BMW eDrive electric motors eliminates the need to use rare earth materials in the rotor. The BMW Group is also taking its own approach to sourcing the raw materials needed to produce high-voltage batteries with the objective of achieving complete transparency in the origin and mining methods of the material: the company purchases lithium and cobalt directly and makes it available to battery cell manufacturers.

“Green steel” reduces CO 2 emissions by up to 95 per cent

When it comes to reducing CO 2 emissions in the supply chain, using electricity from renewable sources can achieve spectacular progress. The BMW Group has already entered into more than 400 contracts with its suppliers to use 100 per cent green electricity. This also includes aluminium suppliers as well as the producers of the battery cells, for example. The BMW Group has been sourcing aluminium from the United Arab Emirates since February 2021 using electricity generated from solar energy. From 2024 onwards, all cast aluminium wheels for the brands BMW and MINI will also be produced using only green electricity. Regeneratively generated energy is used both in the energy-intensive electrolysis when producing aluminium and when casting the wheels.

CO 2 emissions are also being continuously reduced in the steel supply chain. From 2025 onwards, the BMW Group will purchase CO 2 -reduced steel that is produced not using fossil-based raw materials such as coal, but instead using natural gas or hydrogen and green electricity. This reduces CO 2 emissions from making this steel by up to 95 per cent. The BMW Group will provide over 40 per cent of the demand at its European plants from this by 2030. This will reduce CO 2 emissions by up to 400,000 tonnes per year.

Circular economy as the key to more sustainability

The BMW Group is focusing on significantly increasing the proportion of secondary materials in its vehicles with a view to further reducing the depletion of raw materials and emissions. The BMW i Vision Circular has already demonstrated how consistently a car can be designed following the principles of the circular economy. As well as organic-based raw materials, it primarily uses materials that have already gone through a product life cycle and in turn have 100 per cent recyclability. The aim is to recycle raw materials from end-of-life vehicles as effectively as possible for the series production of new cars in the future.

The example set by the BMW i Vision Circular makes it clear that resource conservation begins with a vehicle’s design. This includes consistently reducing components, material groups and surface finishes. Instead of composite materials and adhesives, the BMW i Vision Circular primarily uses mono-materials as well as cords, buttons or quick-release fasteners, meaning that the individual components can be easily separated from one another and recycled according to type when they later come to be recycled.

Innovative recycling processes as the basis for effective circular economy

The BMW Group is also doing important groundwork around vehicle recycling on the road to a closed-loop economy. Up to 10,000 BMW, MINI, Rolls-Royce and BMW Motorrad vehicles are recycled each year at the BMW Group’s Recycling and Dismantling Centre (RDZ) in Unterschleißheim near Munich. They are dismantled in a standardised process that focuses on identifying reusable components as well as materials that are suitable for recycling. BMW Group designers and development engineers use the expertise gained by the RDZ to optimise the recyclability of new models right from the start. The findings are also being shared with our partners. The BMW Group played a key role in setting up the IDIS (International Dismantling Information System) platform. The data and findings published there are available to recyclers around the world.

The RDZ has also used innovative methods for many years to recycle high-voltage batteries from electrified vehicles. Processes have been developed in conjunction with partners from industry and science that can achieve a recycling rate of more than 90 per cent. The BMW Group has also shared this expertise to foster general progress in the field of battery recycling.

In China, the BMW Brilliance Automotive (BBA) joint venture has now for the first time established a closed cycle for reusing the raw materials nickel, lithium and cobalt from high-voltage batteries. The raw materials extracted are used in production of new battery cells for the BMW Group. The closed material cycle conserves the consumption of resources and reduces CO 2 emissions by around 70 per cent compared to using newly mined primary material.

Sustainable production: less CO 2 , waste and water consumption

Circular economy principles also influence production processes. The BMW Group has established closed loops for steel and aluminium between its production sites and suppliers. As a result, around 70 per cent of the steel waste from the pressing plants and the aluminium residues are reused through a direct circular economy (the closed loop).

The BMW Group has reduced CO 2 emissions attributable to vehicle production by more than 70 per cent since 2006. All plants in the international production network have been CO 2 -neutral since 2021. Alongside this, water consumption and waste generation have also been continuously reduced. For example, only around 580 grams of residual waste were produced per vehicle manufactured in 2021 at the BMW Group’s largest European plant in Dingolfing.

Energy efficiency, resource conservation and waste avoidance are being further improved at the BMW Group’s production sites with the transformation into an iFACTORY. The new BMW Group plant in the north-west of the Hungarian city of Debrecen, where our “Neue Klasse” models will be built from 2025 onwards, is a prime example of vehicle production that is consistently geared towards sustainability and the circular economy.

Responsibility for the environment

The 360-degree sustainability approach not only encompasses the entire value chain from resource extraction to production and recycling, but also all levels of sustainability with ecological, economic and social aspects.

The company supports initiatives such as the World Wildlife Fund For Nature’s (WWF) commitment to deep-sea mining as part of its efforts to promote responsible raw material extraction. The BMW Group is declining to use minerals from the deep sea, or to finance deep-sea mining, until the consequences of deep-sea mining on the ecosystems have been comprehensively investigated scientifically and adequate protection for the deep sea can be guaranteed.

Even though no cobalt from the Democratic Republic of Congo is used in the fifth-generation BMW eDrive high-voltage batteries, the BMW Group continues to be involved in a local project there. Together with partners, the company has commissioned the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) (German Society for International Cooperation) to develop measures to improve the working and living conditions of the micro-mining workers and the residents in the surrounding communities.

Responsibility towards the workforce and society

The BMW Group is also intensively fulfilling its responsibility towards its workforce in the current phase of transformation towards electromobility and digitalisation. The largest training initiative in the Group’s history is currently underway. The BMW Group invested around €389 million in 2021 in training and development for its employees. More than 75,000 attendees developed skills in these future fields, enabling them to help shape the transformation within the BMW Group.

The BMW Group positions itself as a reliable and credible employer when it comes to attracting talented and creative professionals; one that guarantees long-term sustainable jobs and attractive employee participation in the company’s success. Individual career development, support for social commitment and a consistent commitment to diversity and against discrimination also demonstrate how the BMW Group lives its social responsibility in practice both internally and externally.

The BMW Group, a company with a multinational workforce and locations on five continents, engages actively in society and stands by its responsibility as part of the bigger picture. Intercultural understanding, solid education for children and young people, and road safety are among the areas to which the company is committed.

The BMW Group also promotes initiatives by its employees. One current example of this is the “PowerUp” project run by two BMW Group young professionals. The idea: a powerful storage block consisting of six high-voltage batteries from former development vehicles stores solar energy from a photovoltaic system and supplies a school near the BMW Group plant in Rosslyn, South Africa. This can generate 36 kWh of clean electricity every day. Enough for about 38 computers, 100 light bulbs and a water pump. Thanks to the high-voltage batteries from Lohhof near Munich, not only does the school save on electricity costs, it also reduces its CO 2 emissions by 40 tonnes a year.

Head-up displays are handy: they project key information onto the windscreen, so the driver doesn't have to look down at the instrument panel all the time. But usually in bite-sized chunks.

What if a head-up display could cover the whole windscreen? That's what's going to happen in BMW's forthcoming Neue Klasse battery electric vehicle (BEV), when it reaches production in 2025. Neue Klasse is essentially a pure-electric next-generation 3-Series, based on a whole new platform and intended to set ""new standards in digitalisation, sustainability and design"", according to the company.

The new BMW head-up display is called BMW Panoramic Vision. Oliver Zipse, chairman of the Board of Management of BMW, confirmed the new tech during his speech at the 2023 BMW Annual Conference.

The new display, projecting across the entire width of the windscreen, creates an ""interaction and information surface"" for all occupants.

Frank Weber, member of the Board for Development at BMW, describes the main advantages of this new head-up display as follows: “The windscreen becomes a single large display with our new BMW Panoramic Vision, opening up completely new possibilities for the design of our vehicles. Whether the driver decides themselves which information they want to display in their own field of vision, or that all occupants can see the entire content.

The projection technology allows visible displays across the entire width of the windscreen for all passengers. BMW Panoramic Vision shows information that is relevant for the driver and passengers with a higher light intensity and contrast onto a dark-coated area at the lower edge of the windscreen.

BMW presented its i Vision Dee concept at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas earlier this year, foreshadowing much of the technology to be used in the Neue Klasse. The study aims to demonstrate the ""fusion of reality and the virtual world"" by turning the windscreen windows into a projection surface.

BMW says more will be revealed about the Neue Klasse at the IAA Mobility 2023 show in Munich, in September.",Your next BMW 3-Series will have a head-up display that's as wide as the windscreen

Monika Dernai, the head of the sustainability team at BMW, said this week that one simple way of reducing waste and the impact of automobiles on the environment is simply to make them last longer.

“We really need to think about prolonging the life of cars; not having a used car market where you sell cars to each other, but maybe take a car and extend its lifespan,” said Dernai, per AutoExpress. “The idea could be that you could freshen up the interior.”

The question of how best reduce the automotive industry’s impact on the environment is a complex one, as countries look to phase out internal combustion vehicles in favor of newer, electric ones. But as is often pointed out, the production of electric vehicles is hard on the environment.

The truth, though, is that the production of all vehicles is hard on the environment. According to Volvo, for instance, steel accounts for an average of 33 percent of its vehicles’ carbon footprint and the global steel industry accounts for seven percent of all global greenhouse gas emissions.

The transportation sector, meanwhile, accounted for 27 percent of America’s greenhouse gases in 2020, according to the EPA. So, while it’s important to replace polluting internal combustion vehicles with electric vehicles that emit considerably less, it will also be important for those EVs to be long-lasting. And that may require new skills.

“We need new skill sets in the aftermarket and to design cars so that the seat can be removed, and a fresh seat can be moved in – then it’s a used car that looks like a new car,” said Dernai. “It can have the same owner, who then doesn’t buy a new car, but we still have a business model as BMW and the whole of society benefits from that.”

Dernai pointed to the importance of making the automotive industry greener because of the realities of how infrastructure is set up. While it may be ideal for people in large cities to use public transport, that doesn’t work for everyone.

“Can we actually just move everybody to public transport? I think the answer is no,” she said. “You’re worried about the public transport in the U.K., but if you look at the US it’s even more desolate. So I think there’s still a market for cars out there.”",BMW’s Head Of Sustainability Says Making Cars Last Longer Could Help The Environment

BERLIN, Feb 7 (Reuters) - A lawsuit against BMW (BMWG.DE) by German climate NGO Deutsche Umwelthilfe demanding the carmaker tighten its carbon emission reduction targets was unfounded, Munich's district court said on Tuesday, but the NGO said it planned to appeal.

The heads of Deutsche Umwelthilfe called in their lawsuit on BMW to end production of combustion engine cars by 2030 and limit its emissions before then to remain within a ""carbon budget"" they calculated for the company, a ratio of the global carbon budget put together by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

Failing to do so would infringe on their right to be protected from the consequences of climate change enshrined in Germany's climate protection law passed in 2021, they argued.

According to the court, DUH's argument could be valid in theory, but there was not yet sufficient evidence that their individual rights were threatened by the carmaker.

BMW had already set goals to align with the Paris Climate Agreement and existing environmental regulations, and it was not yet evident that those goals were not sufficient, the court added.

""We think it is already clear that the regulations set by the state are not enough,"" Juergen Resch, head of DUH, told Reuters. ""Courts say it's not yet legally evident - but if it becomes clear in a few years that carbon reduction targets won't be met, we'll be back at the negotiation table.""

BMW welcomed the ruling, saying in a statement that public debate on how to achieve climate goals should take place via parliament and political processes rather than the legislature.

The court's reasoning mirrored that of Stuttgart's district court in September 2022 on an identical lawsuit by DUH against Mercedes-Benz (MBGn.DE), which the NGO has also appealed.

Several plaintiffs supported by Greenpeace have also filed lawsuits against Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE), with verdicts expected this month.

The goal of these billboards is to not only spotlight the harsh truth, but to call local governments into action to ban ads that promote combustion vehicles.

Brandalism is a UK-based artist and activist collective that, per its website manifesto, dreams of a world “emptied of mad empires, manufactured fears, paranoid dreams and marauded lands.” The group declares that it will speak truth against oppression and injustice and has campaigned against such social issues as body image, visceral “advertising pollution,” and of course, environmental issues like climate change.

Earlier this week, the group shared the following Tweet thread, outlining a subvertising campaign aimed at exposing legacy automakers like Toyota for misleading advertisements that are pro-BEV, despite publicly lobbying against anti-climate policies.

We’ve called out Toyota several times for this behavior and were delighted to see activists from Brandalism, Subvertisers’ International, and Extinction Rebellion band together to install over 400 parody billboards across 14 different European cities.

These activists and artists deserve credit for their work, so we highly recommend reading the entire Twitter thread and visiting each of the organizations websites to learn more on join the fight against climate change and social injustice. In the meantime, here are a few examples of their subvertising expertise on display throughout Europe.

In a recent article posted by Brandalism sharing the reasoning behind the subvertising campaign, a spokesperson for the collective named Tona Merriman spoke to the greenwashing tactics being used by Toyota and BMW, and why there is no longer room in European society for those types of ad campaigns anymore:

Toyota have pushed their ‘Beyond Zero’ sustainability adverts whilst lobbying governments around the world to weaken air quality plans and threatening legal action to protect their profits over a liveable climate. Their adverts are duplicitous. Toyota and BMW use slick marketing campaigns to promote over-sized SUV models that clog up urban neighbourhoods. Electric SUVs are no solution – they’re too big for most parking spaces and their tall bumper size and excessive weight present an increased risk to pedestrians, especially children, involved in road collisions.

With an expiry on gas and diesel vehicles already in place in Europe and the UK starting in 2030, the activists are demanding an immediate end to advertising for all combustion vehicles. This aim is similar to tobacco-style legislation enacted in the 1990s that ended advertising of potentially deadly smoking products.

The subvertising ads calling out Toyota and BMW have been installed at bus stops, on billboards, and on tube advertising spaces in London, Berlin, Stuttgart, Paris, Nantes, Brussels, Ghent, Bristol, Derby, Glasgow, Norwich, Brighton, Exeter, and Reading.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is helping many different industries and is having a particularly strong impact in the automotive industry. Among the most exciting use cases is for fully autonomous vehicles, but that’s not the only area where AI is having an impact. For example, Microsoft and Mercedes-Benz are working together to improve automobile production efficiency.

At the AWS re:Invent cloud conference this week, BMW Group outlined the impact that AI has had on its organization and detailed emerging use cases where AI will yield future positive business outcomes.

In a session, Marco Görgmaier, GM, data transformation and artificial intelligence, BMW Group, said that his team had built up a library of thousands of data assets across the company that can be reused for analysis and AI. Since 2019, he said his team has been able to deliver more than 800 use cases that have yielded over $1 billion in U.S. dollar value. The use cases span research and development, logistics, sales, quality and supplier network.

“The vision and the mission of our team is to drive and scale business value creation through the usage of AI across our value chain,” Görgmaier said.

BMW driving toward a sustainable future with some help from AI

An emerging area where BMW is now investing resources is in helping to improve sustainability.

Görgmaier commented that 60% of the world’s population lives in cities and urban areas and that’s also where 70% of greenhouse gas emissions are generated. What BMW is now trying to do is assist city planners in solving problems to help reduce emissions.

BMW is already helping with machine learning models that are able to predict how traffic regulations can potentially help to reduce both traffic and gasoline emissions. ML models are also used to help identify where there isn’t yet sufficient electric vehicle charging infrastructure. Görgmaier said that a lack of charging infrastructure prevents people from switching to an electric vehicle, which in turn has an impact on sustainability.

There is also a BMW ML effort to help predict the impact of parking space availability and pricing on driving patterns. Those patterns include commuting routes and traffic, which also will have an impact on emissions.

Driving geospatial information with Amazon SageMaker

Görgmaier said that many of the urban sustainability issues that BMW is trying to help solve can benefit from geospatial information. That’s where BMW is starting to make use of new geospatial capabilities in the Amazon SageMaker ML tool suite that were just publicly revealed this week.

One area where BMW is looking to benefit from geospatial ML is for helping to predict when an organization with a fleet of vehicles will be able to transition to electric vehicles.

“We set up the goal to train machine learning models to learn correlations between engine type and driving profiles,” he said. “The rationale behind that was if such a correlation would exist, then the model could learn to predict the affinity of certain drivers for an electric vehicle based on their profiles.”

As BMW was working with fully anonymized data at a fleet level, it had to use GPS traces and geospatial data to make the correlations.

“At the end of the training, the model was capable of predicting how likely it was for specific fleets to convert to EV with an accuracy of more than 80%,” Görgmaier said.",How BMW Group has embraced AI for positive use cases and to improve sustainability | AWS re:Invent

The carmaker aims to reduce carbon emissions from the supply chain by 20% per vehicle by 2030 (compared to 2019). To help reach that goal it is looking at a number of packaging initiatives, including the use of alternative sustainable materials, reducing single-use packaging and introducing lightweight packaging.

BMW said it will increase the proportion of recycled material in reusable packaging for logistics to more than 35% for newly awarded contracts.

“For the individual types of packaging, an individual percentage is agreed upon allocation, depending on geometry and material type,” a spokesperson told Automotive Logistics. “On average, our target for 2022 is more than 35%. There are types of packaging where we have no recyclate, for others we have more than 90%.”

Packaging and material suppliers

The carmaker is working with packaging suppliers on a number of initiatives, including the use of recycled material in containers made of expanded polypropylene (EPP), which can be adapted in shape to the components being packaged. BMW uses 360,000 of these containers annually and they are currently made using 25% recycled material, which saves almost 280 tons of CO2 a year, according to the company.

The EPP containers were piloted and introduced with material supplier JSP and Jacob, an EPP container manufacturer, but BMW said that any of its approximately 10 EPP manufacturers can use the material in series production.

BMW said it plans to increase the proportion of recycled material in the EPP further and the first pilot schemes with 100% recycled material are currently underway. The company said that if the tests are successful, the recycled containers could become standard for new contracts from 2024.

It also said it is launching pilot projects using bio-based materials to replace oil-based polyethylene and polypropylene (PE and PP).

“We are also investigating whether and in what ways we can use materials from recycled household appliances in our packaging,” said the company in a statement. “In the long term, our aim is to use alternatives to raw materials across the board.”

Reducing resources

The efforts being made in packaging are part of an overarching circular strategy at BMW based on the four principles: rethink, reduce, reuse and recycle.

“Our ‘rethink, reduce, reuse, recycle’ approach is being implemented consistently in packaging logistics,” said Michael Nikolaides, head of production network and logistics, BMW Group. “We’re using innovative strategies to consistently reduce the volume of resources we use, thus reducing our carbon footprint.”

Among those innovative strategies is the use of folding load carriers. This year BMW is going to start using folding plastic pallet containers made from 90% recycled material, an alternative to the steel pallet cages it has traditionally used. Following the involvement of several suppliers during the development phase, series production is being carried out by Cabka Group in Berlin.

When empty, the containers can be folded and moved more easily, reducing the transport capacity needed for returns. BMW said that using 15,000 of these containers reduces CO2 by around 3,000 tons per year.

Additionally, BMW said that through the use of small load carriers wit 50% recycled contents and the use of covers, a further 680 tons of carbon emissions savings were possible every year.

The container cover is a standard component for load units that consist of several packaging components, eg. euro pallets, plus small load carriers and covers. The cover is necessary to protect components, ensure safe transport and enable the loaded units to be stacked.

“Several different small load carriers (with different dimensions) are used as standard containers at BMW,” said its spokesperson. “These are part of the load units. In small load carriers, various components or parts are transported from suppliers to BMW sites.”

The carmaker said that the measures it was taking to make packaging more sustainable was focused within Europe at the moment because of available recycling infrastructure but it is currently working towards expanding the strategy to Mexico, the US and China.",BMW to increase recycled packaging as part of sustainability drive

What: “Forces of Nature,” a six-part sponsored content series profiling sustainable technology innovators that is hosted by Dragons’ Den star Michele Romanow.

When & Where: The series launched late last month, with a new episode released each week. The short films can be viewed on CBC’s streaming platform Gem, and on YouTube.

Why: When it comes to the big car companies and the environment, most of the conversation is about electric vehicles. But BMW feels it has a bigger story to tell about its efforts to make the manufacturing process itself more sustainable—from the energy that powers its production plants, to the materials it sources for parts, and the recycling efforts at all stages of the process.

BMW was named the most sustainable automotive company in the world according to the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices, said Jonathan Thomson, director, BMW brand management. “The ability to have a USP in the marketplace—like we have with sustainability—for us it’s something that’s worth talking about.”

But rather than just tell its own story—“It would be a little one dimensional,” said Thomson—BMW wanted to help support and share the story of other small businesses and entrepreneurs similarly committed to sustainability. “It felt like the perfect marriage of what we’re proud of in the work that we’re doing, but creating a more interesting message for this content piece.”

How: Each of the episodes—which range in length from 7:42 to 9:44—profiles one of the six entrepreneurs. At the CBC site and on Gem and YouTube, the content is listed as paid content and starts with a super that explains why BMW produced the series: “BMW’s mission is to be the world’s most sustainable automotive manufacturer and they’re finding and showcasing similar sustainable endeavours globally.”

Early in each episode, Romanow gets into the BMW electric iX xDrive50, and introduces the people being profiled. They include the founders of drone reforestation company Flash Forest, who believe we must plant more trees to tackle Co2 emissions. Another profile is of former Navy Commander Mike Williamson, who is trying to grow seaweed more sustainably, and creating better supply chains for this ecologically significant crop.

Towards the end of each episode Romanow returns to spell out the connection between the entrepreneurs and BMW’s own efforts to be more sustainable.

“Flash Forests’ innovative tree planting technology is trying to reverse the impact of carbon emissions, and BMW has redesigned their business to lower their emissions,” she says.

In the episode about seaweed, she explains that sourcing sustainable materials is key to a healthy supply chain. “Just like how Mike is taking on the supply chain of seaweed, BMW has redesigned their supply chain to better source raw materials that go into electric vehicles like cobalt in a more environmentally friendly way,” she ays.

Other topics covered in future episodes include renewable energy, sustainable materials, the circular economy, and innovative technology.",BMW content series shines a light on sustainability -

Electro fuels made from green energy sources may play a role in decarbonising road transport in years to come, complementing other clean propulsion technologies such as electric power, according to German auto manufacturer BMW.

As carmakers around the world convert massively to electric mobility, BMW is among the few still investing in the internal combustion engine as part of a “technology neutral” approach to zero-emission vehicles.

“To be technology open includes e-fuels,” Peter Lehnert, vice president of research and new technologies with the BMW Group, told EURACTIV.

“However, I think there’s a lot of research to do to scale it up to the potential where it plays a major role in the whole energy mix,” he added.

“I think it’s always good to have different opportunities. We invest in the combustion engine, as there might be chances for them in the future. For urban mobility I’m sure it will be electric,” he said.

Lehnert was speaking from Lisbon, which is hosting the Transport Research Arena (TRA), the largest European research and technology conference on transport and mobility.

Electric fuels

E-fuels are derived from hydrogen through electrolysis, in which an electric current is used to separate hydrogen and oxygen molecules. If CO2 is added, the fuel becomes compatible with current-generation combustion engines.

As CO2 is captured for production and then released when the fuel is combusted, the net level of carbon in the atmosphere is unchanged, making the fuel carbon neutral.

To be classed as green, the energy-intensive e-fuel production process must be made using only renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power.

“In the end, e-fuels need to be produced by green power, otherwise it doesn’t match our targets under the European Green Deal,” said Lehnert.

In looking to the future of road transport, Lehnert said it would be a mistake to choose one technology to the exclusion of others.

“We mentioned hydrogen, it might be e-fuels as well. I think it’s not a question of focusing only on one technology, this is something that is really high risk,” he added.

Lehnert said that the BMW Group, which represents the BMW, Mini, and Rolls-Royce brands, is keeping its mind open regarding energy sources that can cut vehicle emissions.

“Investigating e-fuels is definitely worth it, however we have to look at the balance of the right energy mix,” he said.

BMW has invested in producing hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, breaking from most competitors’ more narrow focus on electric vehicles.

The ability to charge a hydrogen-powered vehicle quickly is a “real advantage” compared to electric vehicles, said Lehnert.

“Especially for long distances, hydrogen is something which is appropriate,” he added.

Asked about the EU’s recently released Euro 7 proposal, which further tightens pollution limits for vehicles, Lehnert said that it’s “good to have a common target” and that the company’s track record with previous standards shows it is “target driven”.

“We take these targets and we are really convinced that we will achieve it,” he said.

EU tightens road vehicle pollution standards ahead of electric switch The long-awaited European Commission proposal to reduce air pollution from vehicles was released Thursday (10 November), modestly tightening exhaust emission standards for cars and vans and placing limits on particles shed from brakes and tyres for the first time.

Lehnert spoke to the press Tuesday (15 November) at the Transport Research Arena conference in Lisbon. The event, which is supported by BMW, gathers researchers, policymakers, and industry to discuss innovation and sustainability in the transport sector.

The role of e-fuels in the road transport sector has proven controversial, with green campaigners criticising support for e-fuels as a way to prolong the life of the internal combustion engine.

Instead, they want to see a faster switch to electric vehicles, which they say offer the cleanest means of driving.

E-fuels will only be able to power 2% of EU car fleet by 2035: analysis Low levels of production mean that e-fuels, a hydrogen-derived fuel source touted as a green solution for internal combustion engine vehicles, will only be able to cover around 2% of the EU’s vehicle fleet by 2035, a new study concludes.

Under recently agreed EU legislation, the sale of polluting vehicles would be banned from 2035 in the bloc, a move which many say spells the end of the internal combustion engine.

However, a non-binding recital clause included in the legislative text obliges the European Commission to conduct a study in 2026 on the possibility of using CO2-neutral fuels, such as e-fuels, to achieve green targets for the road sector.

If the Commission finds that e-fuels are in line with Europe’s climate goals, some believe this will offer a reprieve for the internal combustion engine.

Proponents of e-fuels further position them as a means to decarbonise the current fleet of internal combustion engine vehicles, which will remain on Europe’s roads for decades to come, regardless of rules on their use beyond 2035.

EU finalises deal spelling death of diesel and petrol cars European Union legislators agreed to a deal late Thursday evening (27 October) requiring new cars and vans to be zero-emission as of 2035, a momentous agreement that sets Europe on a trajectory to a largely electric automotive future.

Principle BMW and MINI of San Antonio is one of only 3 out of 370 dealerships in the nation to be recognized for its ongoing commitment to environmental and conservation stewardship by BMW North America.

The Excellence in Sustainability Award highlights best practices at dealerships across three key areas: Reducing CO2 emissions (use of renewable energy); Driving electrification (activities to promote electric mobility); and the Circular economy (recycling activities within dealership operations).

Principle BMW and MINI of San Antonio is committed to the Principle Automotive Group’s purpose, “To be a trusted and caring friend helping people move through life in a sustainable way.” In January of 2021, Principle Auto flipped the switch on a solar panel array to reduce its carbon foot print and CO2 emissions. With nearly 2,700 panels, it is one of the largest arrays on an automobile dealership in the United States. This solar power array produces more than 1.2 million kilowatt hours each year to offset 40-70% of the dealership’s electricity consumption. The BMW of North America award recognized its San Antonio dealership and Principle Automotive Group as a leader in sustainability not only in San Antonio, but in the entire North America region.

Project Statistics and Environmental Impact:

Array Physical Size: 70,000sq/ft+

Percentage of Energy Offset: 40% - 70%

This array offsets 2,000,000 lbs. of carbon each year.

It’s the amount of carbon sequestered by 1,200 acres of U.S. forests each year, or 15,000 tree seedlings grown for 10 years.

“Our Dealers throughout North America are powerful ambassadors to further strengthen the BMW brand image as a sustainability leader, and with many dealers already featuring initiatives that go above and beyond, we want to highlight their impact on our commitment to sustainability,” said Sebastian Mackensen, President and CEO, BMW NA. “More than ever, consumers are seeking to do business with brands and retail locations that share their values, and this recognition will help dealerships put a spotlight on their sustainability initiatives.”

According to Abigail Kampmann, CEO and Co-Founder of Principle Auto Group, “As a company, we are more conscience than ever before of the impact we have as a business and responsible member of the community. This project represents Principle Automotive Group’s commitment to the San Antonio community to make an investment to reduce our carbon foot print and CO2 emissions for many years into the future. We will also begin installation of solar panels at our corporate headquarter offices and at Principle Volvo Cars San Antonio in 2023.”

A group from the organization Ultima Generazione entered the Fabbrica del Vapore museum in Milan, Italy where the car is on display. They proceeded to dump several bags of flour on the car before security intervened.

The special BMW looked like it had a light dusting of snow on it, according to Reuters. Two of the protesters are seen on video being dragged away from the display. A report from Art News states the protesters originally planned to stick themselves to the windows, but it didn't work. That report also shows four protesters sitting on the ground next to the car. It's unknown if the flour caused any damage to the M1's special 13-pound paint job.

The car was painted by Warhol in 1979 and raced at Le Mans that year. BMW has commissioned many art cars over the years, but this M1 is arguably the best-known due to its connection with the famous pop artist. Warhol was known for bright colors and sweeping brush strokes, and this particular M1 certainly delivers on that front. In a 2019 feature on the car, BMW quoted Warhol as saying he ""attempted to show speed as a visual image. When an automobile is really traveling fast, all the lines and colors are transformed into a blur.""

“In a new initiative developed in cooperation with the Danish company PLASTIX, the BMW Group is taking the recycling of maritime plastic waste a step further,” reads BMW’s official statement. “After separation, fishing nets and ropes undergo an innovative process that produces plastic granules. While recycled maritime plastic has so far only been used in the automotive industry in the form of fibers for new vehicle components, this recycled material is now also suitable for the injection moulding process for the first time. The raw material for the components manufactured in this way can consist of around 30 percent maritime plastic waste.”

Unraveling the Pacific Garbage Patch

In terms of reducing ocean plastics, recycling commercial fishing ropes is a huge deal – so huge, in fact, that I’m surprised we don’t talk about it more here at CleanTechnica (probably my fault). How huge is “so huge?” At least 46 percent of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch is commercial fishing nets, which multiply themselves by “catching” debris.

“Over three-quarters of the [Great Pacific Garbage Patch] mass was carried by debris larger than 5cm,” reads this study in Nature, which was cited heavily in the Netflix documentary, Seaspiracy. “(And) at least 46% was comprised of fishing nets.”

Creating a market for used commercial fishing nets and ropes, then, could seriously deter the habit of cutting the ropes and leaving them to drift in the ocean when they get tangles. As a raw material, these nets can be proactively sourced at virtually any major port across the world, and measures like these by BMW could ensure that it doesn’t end up as sea trash.

The BMW Group aspires to be the most successful and sustainable premium manufacturer of automobiles and motorcycles while simultaneously providing premium financial and mobility services. As part of this ambition, the organization sets ambitious sustainability goals that have a decisive impact on day-to-day activities, from product lines to production and supply chain.

This strategy provides an answer to the radical transformation of the entire automotive industry in terms of sustainability. Three main influences require automotive manufacturers to focus on sustainability:

Regulators are imposing measures to reduce the environmentally and socially harmful impact of vehicles and their production, such as the German Supply Chain Act (LkSG).

Public interest about sustainability and sustainable consumption is growing. Thus, demands for electric vehicles are rising. By 2030, experts predict that the industry will see 23 million electrical vehicle units (excluding two/three wheelers) sold around the world per year and 130 million such models on the road.

Investors are pushing for sustainability and climate change as investment criteria to evaluate target companies.

Bold visions and distant targets are useful for providing orientation. However, the BMW Group decided to focus on what really matters: making an effective contribution to environmental protections.

As an original equipment manufacturer, the company has highly complex and extensive supply chains that provide an important lever for impacting and shaping sustainable transformation. Such a transformation can only be achieved with passionate stakeholders that take on responsibility.

In reaction to these demands and its own intrinsic motivation to become a frontrunner in sustainable supply chains, the BMW Group established various new requirements and processes that suppliers and purchasers would need to fulfill and consider during the procurement process. To ensure their implementation in day-to-day business, improve awareness and understanding, and enable all stakeholders to contribute to this initiative, the BMW Group decided to implement a sustainability transformation program. The target group included around 1,200 purchasers and supplier account managers as well as the company’s direct suppliers.

Capgemini Invent enables end-to-end sustainability transformation

The main goal of the transformation program was to increase its audience’s awareness of sustainable business practices and empower them with knowledge in the topics of decarbonization, environmental and social standards, and circular economy, and integrate these into the procurement processes.

To achieve this, a joint team of Capgemini Invent and BMW Group experts followed an agile change approach characterized by co-creation and mobilization elements. The heart of the enablement concept consisted of target group-specific, modular learning journeys based on innovative, web-based, and interactive trainings that suited purchasers’ and suppliers’ needs and were available on demand. Furthermore, the learning journeys included community, trainer-led, and group coaching sessions.

With a team from Workforce & Organization and Sustainable Supply Chain, Capgemini Invent provided expertise on change management, communication, and enablement, as well as expert knowledge on sustainability and supply chains. Setting the foundation with an inspiring change story which Capgemini developed with the BMW Group, and kick-off events, innovative communication formats raised awareness.

Tailored transformation program for a sustainable supply chain

Acceptance, enthusiasm, and support for the change process among target groups are higher than ever before as a result of the tailor-made communication and training modules. The success of this effort represents a major step for the BMW Group towards taking on a pioneer role in sustainable supply chain creation and management while also fulfilling legal requirements and strategic sustainability goals.

Looking ahead, Capgemini Invent and the BMW Group will continue to collaborate on several initiative and projects with a focus on sustainability as well as transformation.

In a highly volatile environment, the BMW Group remained on course in the first half of 2022. With flexibility and expertise, the company encountered challenges including continued supply chain disruptions and bottlenecks for semiconductors and specific supplier parts.

The BMW Group’s underlying strength and operational excellence was reflected in its profits for the first six months: Despite the volatility, the company earned a Group EBT margin of 24.5% (Q2 2022: 11.3%). The revaluation of the previously held shares in the Chinese joint venture BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd. (BBA) contributed to the high return. This revaluation due to full consolidation on February 11 increased the financial result by € 7.7 billion.

The Automotive EBIT margin in Q2 was 8.2% (HY1 2022: 8.5%). In the first two quarters of the year, the full consolidation of BBA dampened Automotive Segment earnings. Excluding the effects from its full consolidation, the BMW Group posted an EBIT margin in the Automotive Segment of 12.0% in Q2 (HY1 2022: 12.6%) ‒ well above the long-term strategic corridor of 8-10%.

“Especially under unfavourable conditions, the BMW Group is characterized by a high degree of resilience. The company recognizes changes in the economic environment at an early stage and counteracts them accordingly. Our high degree of flexibility and operational performance have proven time and again to be an effective combination to ensure the BMW Group’s successful course even in rough waters. This strength will now be important again, as we see an increasing economic headwind coming up in addition to the ongoing supply shortages,” said BMW AG CEO Oliver Zipse in Munich on Wednesday.

To the long-term success of BMW Group contribute its pioneering spirit and consistent focus on innovation. An upcoming proof-point of its innovative strength is the pure electric NEUE KLASSE. It will be fully geared towards sustainability and circular economy, using new technologies and production processes from the middle of the decade onwards. The all-electric products of NEUE KLASSE will make a significant contribution to BMW Group sales volumes from the middle of the decade onwards and will further accelerate the ramp-up of e-mobility.

“Emotional products and innovative technology are and will remain the backbone of our business success. Our rapidly growing range of all-electric vehicles with the BMW Operating System 8 impresses customers and experts alike — and is already a central driver of our sales today,” said Zipse. “From 2025, we will make the next big leap with the NEUE KLASSE: The NEUE KLASSE defines what the BMW Group stands for in the future. At the start, we are planning a compact sedan in the 3‑series segment and a sporty SUV. By the end of the decade, the NEUE KLASSE is expected to account for more than half of our sales.”

Deliveries of fully-electric vehicles more than double

In the first half of 2022, the BMW Group was able to more than double its sales of pure electric vehicles to 75,890 units (2021: 36,087 vehicles/+110.3%; Q2 2022: 40,601 units; +85.2%). During the same period, sales of electrified vehicles increased significantly, climbing 20.4% to 184,468 units (2021: 153,243 vehicles; Q2 2022: 94,799 units; +14.2%). Electrified vehicles’ share of total deliveries rose to 15.9% (HY1 2021: 11.4%).

The BMW iX3* (2022: 21,548 vehicles; HY1 2021: 10,009 vehicles) and the MINI Cooper SE* (2022: 18,428 vehicles; HY1 2021: 13,454 vehicles) remained the most in-demand fully-electric models, reporting significantly higher sales than in the prior-year quarter. 69% of these fully-electric vehicles were delivered to customers in the European region. The innovative BMW iX and BMW i4, which are still being launched in the markets, have also been well received and contributed to the outstandingly high order bank of BMW Group. Further sales growth is expected in the second half of the year – on top from the fully-electric BMW i3 built in China, but also from the BMW iX1* and the BMW i7* luxury sedan.

Lower sales due to supply bottlenecks – base effect from prior year

Ongoing semiconductor supply issues and supply chain disruptions following Covid lockdowns in China, impacted production and deliveries during the first six months. With a total of 1,160,094 vehicles, BMW Group sales failed to reach the all-time high of the previous year (HY1 2021: 1,339,047 units; -13.4%; Q2 2022: 563,187 units; -19.8% from Q2 2021). The company nevertheless expanded its leading position in the global premium segment.

Significantly higher Group revenues in first half-year

Despite negative sales growth, Group revenues climbed 19.1% in the first six months of 2022 to € 65,912 million (HY1 2021: € 55,360 million; Q2 2022: 34,770; +21.6%). The full consolidation of the Chinese subsidiary BBA was one of the main contributing factors, bringing in revenues of around € 11 billion.

The Group cost of sales also rose significantly for the same reason, reaching € 54,399 million (HY1 2021: € 44,109 million; +23.3%; Q2 2022: € 28,780 million; Q2 2021: € 22,521 million; +27.8%).

Group earnings before tax totalled € 16,156 million after six months (HY1 2021: € 9,736 million; +65.9%), a new all-time high. This includes a tailwind of € 7.7 billion from the revaluation of previously held BBA shares at fair market value.

In the second quarter (Q2 2022: € 3,929 million; Q2 2021: € 5,979 million; ‑34.3%), Group EBT was lower than for the same period of last year. On the one hand, this reflects the one-time gain of € 1 billion in the second quarter of 2021 from the partial reversal of the provision for the EU antitrust proceedings. On the other, headwinds from the full consolidation of BBA in the second quarter of this year impacted Group EBT by around € 1.1 billion.

The Group EBT margin for the first six months came in at 24.5% (HY1 2021: 17.6%; Q2 2022: 11.3%; Q2 2021: 20.9%).

Group net profit amounted to € 13,232 million (HY1 2021: € 7,623 million; +73.6%; Q2 2022: € 3,047 million; Q2 2021: € 4,790 million; -36.4%).

Group research and development costs (IFRS) for the first half-year totalled € 3,128 million (HY1 2021: € 2,737 million; +14.3%; Q2 2022: € 1,560 million; Q2 2021: € 1,304 million/+19.6%) and were therefore significantly higher than the previous year. Spending was mainly focused on new models, as well as further electrification and digitalisation of the line-up. Upfront investments were also made for the NEUE KLASSE and automated driving.

The R&D ratio (HGB) of 4.5% (HY1 2021: 4.6%; Q2 2022: 4.5%; Q2 2021: 4.5%) was on a par with the previous year. The R&D ratio for the full year is expected to be within the target range of 5-5.5%.

Group capital expenditure was at a significantly higher level during the first six months at € 2,929 million (HY1 2021: € 1,709 million; +71.4%; Q2 2022: € 1,831 million; Q2 2021: € 950 million; +92.7%). The increase is primarily due to upfront expenditures for the ramp-up of e-mobility and investments at BBA. The capex ratio stood at 4.4% at the end of the first half-year.

“Our investors know that the BMW Group has the financial strength to invest today in the success of tomorrow. We are steering the company through the current transformation with strategic foresight. We are positioning it in such a way that we can leverage our employees’ innovative capabilities and expertise to play a leading role in sustainable mobility today and in the future,” stated Nicolas Peter, member of the Board of Management responsible for Finance.

Full consolidation affects financial figures for Automotive Segment

The financial key figures for the Automotive Segment show significant effects from the full consolidation of BBA during the reporting period. Segment revenues rose significantly to € 56,741 million (HY1 2021: € 47,745 million/+18.8%; Q2 2022: € 30,015 million; Q2 2021: € 24,982 million; +20.1%).

As before, the BMW Group continued to benefit from positive pricing and product mix effects and from growth in its aftersales business. Revenues were also lifted by currency translation effects. In particular, the positive situation on the used car markets in the USA, UK and Germany led to higher revenues from the sale of end-of-lease vehicles.

The segment cost of sales rose to € 48,093 million (HY1 2021: € 39,060 million/+23.1%; Q2 2022: € 25,464 million; 2021: € 20,344 million/+25.2%), with the BBA cost of sales a major contributor to this increase. In addition, headwinds from full consolidation, such as depreciation and amortisation from the purchase price allocation and elimination of inter-company profits, totalled around € 2.3 billion. Rising raw material and energy prices, as well as expenses due to higher prices and research and development costs, also increased the cost of sales. The growing percentage of electrified vehicles this year also raised costs compared to 2021.

Earnings before financial result (EBIT) totalled € 4,830 million for the reporting period (HY1 2021: € 6,189 million/-22.0%; Q2 2022: € 2,463 million; Q2 2021: € 3,953 million; -37.7%). The Automotive Segment EBIT margin was 8.5% (HY1 2021: 13.0%; Q2 2022: 8.2%; Q2 2021: 15.8%). Excluding the headwinds from the full consolidation of BBA, the segment EBIT margin came in at 12.6% for the half-year and 12.0% for the three-month period.

The segment’s financial result totalled € 8,116 million (HY1 2021: € 1,337 million; Q2 2022: € 63 million; Q2 2021: € 797 million). This includes the tailwind from the revaluation of the previously-held BBA shares in February already referred to. The at-equity result, since 11 February no longer including BBA earnings, stood at € 137 million and was therefore significantly lower (HY1 2021: € 975 million; -85.9%; Q2 2022: € -123 million; Q2 2021: € 546 million).

Due to the effects described above, segment earnings before tax (EBT) for the first six months of 2022 amounted to € 12,946 million (HY1 2021: € 7,526 million; Q2 2022: € 2,526 million; Q2 2021: € 4,750 million; -46.8%).

Free cash flow in the Automotive Segment reached € 7,770 million for the reporting period (HY1 2021: € 4,902 million; Q2 2022: € 2,954 million; Q2 2021: € 2,380 million). The acquisition of BBA’s liquid funds, less the purchase price transferred in February, contributed € 5,011 million to this amount. In view of the strong demand for all-electric vehicles, the BMW Group will increase its investments in electromobility from the second half of the year. In addition, the company expects a slight decline in deliveries for the full year. This will only be partially offset by positive price and mix effects and the development of the used car markets. As a consequence, it will now be targeting a free cash flow in the Automotive Segment for the full year of at least €10 billion.

Earnings slightly higher for Financial Services Segment

The Financial Services Segment managed a total of 5,411,274 financing and leasing contracts with retail customers at the end of the second quarter (31 December 2021: 5,577,011/-3.0%). The limited availability of new cars – combined with intense competition in the financial services sector – was also reflected in the number of new contracts. In the first half of 2022, a total of 815,448 new financing and leasing contracts were concluded with retail customers (HY1 2021: 1,029,345; -20.8%; Q2 2022: 382,019; Q2 2021: 540,279; -29.3%).

Thanks to the high-quality product mix, the financing volume per vehicle increased, partially offsetting the reduction in new contracts. The volume of new business from all financing and leasing contracts with retail customers amounted to € 28,442 million (HY1 2021: € 32,445 million) and was therefore only 12.3% lower than for the same period of last year.

High income from the resale of end-of-lease vehicles, especially in the US and Europe, paired with positive currency translation effects, benefited both segment revenues and earnings.

With growth of 2.3%, earnings before tax (EBT) in the Financial Services Segment increased slightly to € 1,981 million (HY1 2021: € 1,936 million; Q2 2022: € 974 million; Q2 2021: € 1,149 million; -15.2%).

The percentage of BMW Group new vehicles leased or financed by the Financial Services Segment stood at 44.4% at the end of the second quarter (2021: 50.2%/-5.8 %-points).

Motorcycles Segment increases deliveries and revenues

In the first half of the year, the sales volume in the Motorcycles Segment remained at the same high level as in the strong prior year. A total of 107,555 BMW motorcycles and scooters were delivered to customers. (HY1 2021: 107,610 units; ‑0.1%; Q2 2022: 60,152 units; (Q2 2021: 65,018 units; -7.5%). Revenues were up slightly at € 1,663 million (HY1 2021: € 1,621 million; +2.6%; Q2 2022: € 864 million; Q2 2021: € 868 million; -0.5%).

Segment earnings before financial result (EBIT) totalled € 235 million (HY1 2021: € 284 million; -17.3%; Q2 2022: € 127 million; Q2 2021: € 149 million; ‑14.8%), with an EBIT margin of 14.1% (HY1 2021: 17.5%; Q2 2022: 14.7%; Q2 2021: 17.2%).

Outlook – high volatility expected to continue

The BMW Group expects business conditions to remain difficult in the second half of the year. The ongoing supply bottlenecks, particularly for semiconductors, the war in Ukraine and interruptions in supply chains have led to a decline in deliveries in the Automotive segment in the first half of the year. Although the company expects sales volumes in the second half of the year to be solidly higher than in the same period of the previous year, this will not fully compensate for lost volume in HY1 2022. As a consequence, deliveries for the year are expected to be slightly below previous year.

The percentage of electrified vehicles should still increase significantly and sales of fully-electric vehicles are expected to more than double.

CO₂ emissions in the EU new car fleet can still be expected to be slightly reduced. The significant increase in the proportion of electrified vehicles in total deliveries of the BMW Group is decisive for this.

As before, the company anticipates significantly higher Group pre-tax earnings, due to the full consolidation of BBA.

In the Automotive Segment, the EBIT margin is forecast to be within the range of 7 to 9%, as before. The expected decline in deliveries should be partially offset by positive price and mix effects and the continued good development of the used car markets. RoCE in the automotive business is also expected to remain in the range of 14 to 19%.

A slight increase in deliveries is projected for the full year for the Motorcycles Segment. The EBIT margin is expected to be in the target range of 8 to 10% and the segment ROCE in a corridor of 19 to 24%.

In the Financial Services segment, the consistently good performance in the used car markets led to a rising segment result. Accordingly, Return on Equity (RoE) is now expected to be in the corridor of 17 to 20% (previously: 14 to 17%).

Based on current assessments, the Financial Services segment has recognised appropriate levels of provisions/ allowances to cover residual value and credit risks.

The targets outlined above are intended to be achieved with significantly higher employee numbers, resulting from the full consolidation of BBA. The proportion of women in management positions in the BMW Group should rise slightly regardless of the full consolidation.

Ongoing inflation and interest rate hikes will continue to shape the macroeconomic environment in the coming months and impact demand.

Accordingly, the above-average order bank — particularly in Europe — is expected to normalize towards the end of the year.

Further significant tightening of sanctions against Russia or reactive measures by Russia, an interruption of the gas supply impacting own plants and suppliers’ locations, as well as the possibility of the conflict spreading outside of Ukraine and further extended and ongoing Covid lockdowns are not factored into this guidance.

The actual business performance of the BMW Group may differ from current expectations given the numerous uncertainties and existing risks and opportunities.

The aim is to significantly reduce the CO 2 footprint of all aspects of BMW’s business and take its place in the circular economy, because the fight against climate change and the way we use resources will determine the future of our society – and that of the BMW Group.

However, what really matters is that we make an effective contribution to environmental and climate protection here and now. To implement concrete measures today and transform the framework for personal mobility for future generations, a strong and passionate team is the foundation. This is based on the underlying guiding principle that sustainability can only be progressed with a workforce that takes responsibility.

Sustainability is not just a trend at BMW. The company have been taking responsibility for 50 years, when the first Environmental Manager in the automotive industry was appointed in 1973. BMW was the first automotive manufacturer to produce a Sustainability Report in 2001. Since 2020, the BMW Group only uses renewable energy sources, and 99% of the annual production waste is recycled.

Specifically, the BMW Group aims to cut CO 2 emissions from the entire vehicle lifecycle of the car by a minimum of 40% by 2030. To detail this, the lifecycle is broken down into three distinct stages: the supply chain with suppliers and companies it works with; the vehicle production phase; and the use phase, when customers are driving BMW and MINI cars and motorcycles.

Supply Chain

The BMW Group is taking a pioneering role to set concrete CO 2 targets for its entire supply chain and will reduce CO 2 emissions in this area by 20% by 2030. For example, since 2020 cobalt and lithium purchased for battery cells is sourced from certified mines in Australia and Morocco. At BMW’s factories, biodiversity is also promoted through ecological habitats. There’s even a real buzz above the parent plant’s roofs in Munich where 160,000 bees call home. These habitats help pollinate green areas in and around the home of BMW. This work is thanks to several voluntary beekeepers who have day jobs at the Munich plant and have made beekeeping their hobby. Almost all BMW’s German plants now support bee colonies, and this is just one small example of how sustainable practices are being incorporated to every part of the business.

Production Phase

A target of an 80% reduction of CO 2 emissions by 2030 has been set, committing to the lowest possible level of resource consumption in production of BMW’s cars and motorcycles. This will be achieved in part by re-using materials in the manufacturing process.

At present there is an average of 30% of re-used or ‘secondary materials’ contained within each car that BMW builds. This will increase to 50% by 2030, with these secondary materials coming from vehicles that have reached the end of their useful life and by-products from elsewhere within BMW's manufacturing processes. Factories are also assessed for the optimum efficiency, and since 2020 all of BMW's external power supplies have come from renewable sources, making BMW the benchmark for other manufacturers. This includes a wind farm at BMW's plant in Leipzig, and hydroelectric supplies for its Munich and Dingolfing factories too.

Use Phase

BMW Group is aiming to deliver 10 million fully electric vehicles over the next decade with sustainability at their core. This year BMW Group will have 15 fully electric models in production include the iX SAV, i4 Gran Coupé, iX3 SUV and the all-new BMW iX1 and i7 models launching later this year. The MINI brand will have an all-electric product portfolio from the early 2030s.

At the end of a car's useful life, BMW is reducing it back to its raw materials for use in the manufacturing process. This is just one way to increase the use of secondary materials in a car's construction, while future products will be designed and engineered to accept these materials. In fact, BMW can already re-use up to 90% of the material found in its high-voltage batteries.

BMW also recognises the importance of social sustainability with its workforce, partner suppliers and society in general. For employees, that means career development and talent management, as well as promoting staff diversity across the company in a working environment that encourages personal growth.","The BMW Group sets new, ambitious CO2 emissions goals for 2030"

The groups have collectively posted over 400 billboards to bring the automakers' deceit to light.

This comes as no surprise since Toyota has been at it for some time, even getting in some hot water in the past for its misleading claims about its electric vehicles that don't need to be plugged in. They're just traditional hybrids with a gas engine and tailpipe emissions, though Toyota insists it's helping to combat climate change more than other automakers.

Electrek points out that BMW and Toyota are working to promote electric cars while also lobbying against them. These companies hope to continue producing gas cars well into the future, though their public posts often aim to tell a different story.

Last year, InfluenceMap ranked Toyota as the 10th worst company in the world when it comes to anti-climate lobbying. BMW didn't fare much better, landing at number 16 in the ranking. Brandalism writes that in 2021, just 0.2% of Toyota's car sales were EVs. The brand did bring a fully electric SUV to market in 2022 – the bZ4x – but it was recalled almost immediately due to a chance the wheels could fall off, and sales have been minimal.

BMW has been producing fully electric cars for years and enjoyed notable success with the iconic i3. However, many of its offerings that followed were simply emissions-spewing plug-in hybrid electric versions of existing gas-powered models. Since then, the brand has started to release a series of EVs, such as the iX and i4, but it's also still heavily invested in its gas-powered cars, many of which would be considered gas guzzlers due to their high fuel consumption.

Artists and activists at Brandalism, which is based in the UK, posted the following thread on Twitter, which brings together 10 posts that highlight various billboards, images, and stories related to the cause:

As you can see, Brandalism shares that some 400 car billboards have been ""hacked and replaced in 14 cities."" Be sure to click on the tweets embedded above to see the full thread. We've included a few of the tweets below for readers who don't frequent Twitter, though you don't need a Twitter account to view the thread on the social media site.

The group of activists is going so far as to ask government leaders to bring forth ""tobacco-style"" advertising bans on projects that are harmful to the environment. More specifically, they believe the government should be actively pointing out that large, gas-guzzling SUVs are a detriment and that automakers shouldn't be advocating for them and making plans to continue producing and selling them for many more decades to come.

While the majority of automakers have latched onto all-electric vehicles, hydrogen seems to be the way forward as the cleaner of the two alternative fuels. BMW believes now is the time to explore the world of hydrogen-powered cars, as it’s starting to produce a new iX5 Hydrogen SUV.

BMW claims that the upcoming iX5 Hydrogen is a “small-series” vehicle, which we’re taking to mean it is a limited model. The SUV will be available as a “technology demonstrator for locally carbon-free mobility” in a few regions starting next spring. Seeing BMW come out with a new hydrogen-powered SUV may confuse some people, but the German brand believes that hydrogen will become crucial for it to meet its emissions goals and commitment to the Paris Climate Agreement.

“Hydrogen is a versatile energy source that has a key role to play as we progress towards climate neutrality,” said Frank Weber Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, Development. “We are certain that hydrogen is set to gain significantly in importance for individual mobility and therefore consider a mixture of battery and fuel cell electric drive systems to be a sensible approach in the long term.”

Unlike pure electric vehicles, hydrogen-powered cars, don’t require lithium, cobalt, or nickel, claims Weber. This makes them far friendlier to the planet to produce since they don’t need a massive battery pack with loads of materials that need to be mined, and it allows BMW to stick to building vehicles on its own more. Plus, fuel cell vehicles only emit water vapor.

BMW will be building the iX5 Hydrogen at a plant at its Munich Research and Innovation Center. The SUV features a hydrogen fuel-cell system with an electric battery and an electric motor that make a combined output of 374 horsepower, which is routed through the rear wheels. This makes the iX5 Hydrogen nearly as powerful as the X5 xDrive45e PHEV SUV, which has 389 horsepower. Fun fact: the fuel cells in the SUV are from Toyota, who has been co-developing fuel cells with BMW.

With BMW set only to produce a very small number of iX5 Hydrogen SUVs, these SUVs are more like test vehicles for the brand. But they’ll represent BMW’s most serious hydrogen-powered test vehicles since the 7-Series from the 2000s and the 5-Series GT Hydrogen from 2015. Depending on how the tests go, we could see a production model on sale, though the chances of it coming to the U.S. are slim.

According to data from the U.S. Department of Energy, there are 53 hydrogen charging stations in California and one in Hawaii – that’s it. It’s far more likely that BMW will offer the iX5 Hydrogen as a Europe-only vehicle, as the continent has 375,000 hydrogen chargers as of 2021.

The Rein Automotive Water Pump Assembly Kit (CRP P/N WPU0505) has been designed to improve upon the OE design and includes an all-aluminum water pump housing, replacing the OE’s plastic version.

“One of the most common complaints of OE water pump assembly for these BMW 6-cylinder, 3.0L engines is that the plastic housings had a tendency to crack at around 50-60,000 miles, due to high vibration and heat,” notes Christian Eichstaedt, CRP Automotive’s Director of Product Innovation.

“The resulting crack would lead to a loss of coolant that would eventually short the electrical portion of the pump. CRP developed this Rein Water Pump kit with an all-aluminum pump housing to combat this issue, while also replacing the plastic flange and plug with aluminum components to further reinforce the repair.

“Technicians who choose this kit can be assured that their repair will hold.”

The Rein Water Pump Assembly Kit includes all of the hoses, clamps, bolts, and necessary hardware required to complete a successful service.

The kit also includes aluminum mounting screws and any application specific components, ensuring technicians fast, trouble-free installation.

Rein Water Pump Assembly Kits are available for popular BMW models including the 2008-10 135I, 2007-10 335I, 2009-10 335I XDRIVE, and 2007-08 335XI. Application coverage for the kit exceeds 100,000 VIO across the U.S. and Canada.

As per Celebrity Net Worth, he has about $350 million to his name and the actor loves spending his hard-earned money on the things he loves. One of the things he loves is cars and so he spends lavishly to add to his collection. Reportedly he has a Rolls-Royce Ghost, a 1965 Ford Mustang, and a two-story RV with more than 1,200 floor space.

However, that’s not all. The actor also owns a BMW i8 Hybrid. One would think that the actor would take the sleek, stylish, and environmentally-friendly car everywhere. But that’s not the case. Smith apparently still heavily relies on his fuel-chugging Ford Taurus for everyday work.

Will Smith Discards BMW i8 Hybrid For Ford Taurus

Will Smith has a history of environmental activism. The actor hosted Welcome to Earth, a National Geographic and Disney+ series that showed viewers the wonders of the planet. Apart from this, the star launched the Just Water company with his son Jaden Smith in 2015. The bottles used were made out of renewable 82% plant-based resources. Along with this, Smith also partnered with Leonardo DiCaprio in 2019 to launch eco sneakers.

All of the profits went to supporting the preservation efforts of the Amazon rainforest. As such, with the actor’s long relationship with environmental activism, one might think that he would use his BMW i8 Hybrid more. The car comes with a whopping price tag of $140,000 and it can run fully on electricity for a total of 22 miles at 75mph speeds. If used with petrol and set on EcoPro mode, it gives a 330-mile range in total. Also, it has a score of 46 g/km carbon emissions.

However, reportedly the actor saves this car for special events or occasions and instead prefers to drive in a Ford Taurus that’s not electric or hybrid. It offers a fuel efficiency of 112.0 MPG or 2.1 L/100 km and has 49 g/km carbon emissions as per the NEDC test. One has to wonder why Smith prefers the car that chugs more fuel and harms the environment with its emissions. Fans speculate it’s because he had the Ford Taurus for a long time and is attached to it.

BMW and Jaguar Land Rover’s leather suppliers are linked to illegal deforestation in the territory of one of the world’s most threatened uncontacted tribes, according to an official complaint launched today by Survival International.

Two Italian companies, Pasubio and Gruppo Mastrotto, source leather from tanneries that are supplied by cattle ranches guilty of occupying and illegally deforesting the land of uncontacted members of Paraguay’s Ayoreo tribe. These Ayoreo are the last uncontacted Indigenous people in South America outside the Amazon, and the ranches threaten their very existence.

BMW, Jaguar Land Rover and many others buy the two companies’ leather to make interiors, seats and steering wheels.

This link is at the heart of a formal complaint filed today by Survival International, in agreement with and authorized by contacted Ayoreo people, against Pasubio at Italy’s ‘National Contact Point’ (NCP) for the OECD.

A few weeks ago, Survival sent cease-and-desist letters to both companies urging them to halt these imports. Gruppo Mastrotto has responded by initiating a dialogue with Survival, which is still ongoing, but Pasubio has sent only a brief disclaimer. Survival has therefore, in agreement with and authorized by contacted Ayoreo people, submitted a formal complaint against Pasubio under the OECD’s Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises.

The link between the leather used in the car industry and the illegal destruction of the Ayoreo’s forest was first revealed in an investigation by Earthsight. In two reports, Grand Theft Chaco I and Grand Theft Chaco II, Earthsight revealed that almost two-thirds of the hides exported from Paraguay go to Italian companies, principally Pasubio, which depends for more than 90% of its €313m annual revenue on the automotive industry.

Today’s complaint states that Pasubio appears to have violated several principles in the OECD Guidelines, including those on Disclosure of Information (III), Human Rights (IV), Environment (VI) and Consumer Interests (VIII) and demands that the company stops importing hides from tanneries in Paraguay that are responsible for and/or involved in the deforestation of the Ayoreo’s forest.

The head of Survival’s Ayoreo campaign, Teresa Mayo said today: “The Paraguayan government has handed over most of the Ayoreo’s ancestral territory to agribusiness companies who are relentlessly clearing the forest: first they cut down the valuable hardwoods, then they set fire to the forest, and finally they introduce livestock onto the cleared land. The Ayoreo are witnessing the destruction of their livelihoods, their physical and mental health, and even their lives. But they remain determined to fight for their continued existence, alongside their uncontacted relatives, who are forced to live on the run from bulldozers in oases of forest that are getting smaller and smaller every day.""

Francesca Casella, director of Survival Italy, said today: “Demand for car leather is predicted to increase by more than 5% per year until 2027. Clients and end-consumers need to be aware of this, and since Italy is the world’s biggest buyer of Paraguayan leather, it has the power and responsibility to intervene by stopping doing business with cattle ranches that operate illegally on Indigenous land with the connivance of corrupt politicians and officials.”

Tagüide Picanerai, an Ayoreo Totobiegosode man, said today: “The harmful impact that beef and leather production has is deforestation, and that affects the people living in the area (…). Leather is like a hidden aspect of cattle ranching, it isn’t taken into account as we only talk about beef, but it really does affect the local people a lot. It’s those who produce the cattle and export them and then sell them over there in Europe who benefit, but here it means deforestation and the Ayoreo people suffer.”

Notes to Editors:

- The Ayoreo number more than 5,000 and live in Paraguay and Bolivia. One sub-group, known as the Ayoreo-Totobiegosode, are the subject of this complaint. Most Ayoreo-Totobiegosode are contacted and live in settled communities in Paraguay, but some are still uncontacted.

- The Ayoreo Totobiegosode have been fighting for the return of their ancestral lands since 1993, when they presented a formal land claim to the government.

- In 2001, the government of Paraguay formally recognised a 550,000 hectare territory in Alto Paraguay province as the ’Natural and Cultural Heritage of the Ayoreo Totobiegosode (PNCAT). However, to date the authorities have only transferred some tens of thousands of hectares of land titles to the Ayoreo, and they continue to violate both the injunction issued by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) over the territory (which requires the State of Paraguay to protect and safeguard the PNCAT and the uncontacted groups living there by preventing the entry of third parties and unwanted contact); and resolutions issued in 2018 by the National Forestry Institute (INFONA), which prohibit all deforestation inside the area.

- Paraguay’s meat and hides are responsible, per unit weight, for more deforestation than any other raw material on Earth (Grand Theft Chaco I, p. 36).

- Paraguay’s Chaco forest is being destroyed at one of the fastest rates on Earth.

Compared to conventionally manufactured aluminum, this approach can save around 70% of CO 2 emissions. The planned supply volumes will be used exclusively in vehicle production at BMW Group Plant Spartanburg in South Carolina, in body components such as the hood, for example.

Owing to its comparatively low weight and other positive material properties, aluminum occupies a firm place in the BMW Group’s intelligent composite construction. In the supply chain of a mid-sized fully-electric vehicle around a quarter of the CO 2 emissions are attributable to aluminum. This underlines the tremendous potential of reducing CO 2 in the aluminum supply chain.

ELYSIS (earlier post) is the first carbon-free smelting technology for aluminum as it enables the production of aluminum metal without direct carbon dioxide emissions during the smelting process, instead emitting pure oxygen.

The innovative method uses carbon-free anodes to eliminate all process-related CO 2 emissions and was successfully tested at industrial level for the first time in 2021. The BMW Group intends to become one of the first customers to use this technology in standard production.

In addition to the carbon-free process, the agreement also covers aluminum alloys produced using electricity from renewable energy sources, with CO 2 emissions that are only a third of the industry average. The aluminum production facilities in Québec run almost entirely on electricity from six local hydroelectric power stations. As a further contribution to resource conservation, recycled content will be mixed in with the end product to potentially reach up to 50% secondary material.

The use of Rio Tinto’s blockchain technology also guarantees full traceability of the aluminum, all the way back to the original bauxite mine. This enables end-to-end transparency throughout the supply chain and therefore plays an important part in tracking compliance with environmental and social standards for extraction of raw materials.

In 2021, Rio Tinto launched START, a new standard in transparency, traceability and provenance for the aluminum industry. Using secure blockchain technology, START provides key information about how Rio Tinto aluminum was made, covering fourteen criteria: global warming potential, water management, waste management, energy sources, air emissions, biodiversity, land management, recycled content, safety performance, community investment, third-party assessments, ethics and compliance training, diversity in leadership and Rio Tinto’s whistleblower program.",BMW Group to source lower CO2 aluminum from Rio Tinto in Canada from 2024

Poop. Manure. Cow pies. US Dairy farming remains a massive contributor of greenhouse gas methane emitted by its endless lanes of cattle providing milk to the public. California in particular currently sits at as the US dairy farming mecca, but also accounts for nearly half of the methane emissions in the entire state. New recycling methods have been put into place and automakers like BMW have utilized their carbon offsets to power its EVs, but many argue this is greenwashing and the entire incentive program encourages more emissions, not less.

Over the past decade, biogas energy derived from animal waste has become a widely popular option for dairy farmers as an additional income stabilizer. Energy gathered using methane digesters has led to automakers like BMW using those offsets to charge its electric vehicles with less guilt on its conscience, but analysts have cried “greenwashing” as these methods not only produce the same environmental impact as fossil fuels, but also encourage dairy farms in the United States to increase emissions.

In 2011, California began an incentive program called the low carbon fuel standard (LCFS) which rewards dairy farmers for converting their methane into energy that can then be sold to other companies, like automakers for example, as offset credits. The concept of offsets is an entirely different debate we will save for another day, but in spirit, this idea sounds beneficial although we’d argue a complete focus on natural resources like wind and solar prove better in the long run.

In fact, several scientists and environmental advocates agree as much. A January 2022 report from the Union of Concerned Scientists relayed the following as it pertains to manure biomethane analysis:

We recognize that the capture and productive use of waste biomethane generated by anaerobic digestion (AD) from manure lagoons is a useful mechanism to mitigate methane pollution and can also replace a small amount of fossil methane use in energy and industrial applications.

However, the system remains flawed and so does its priorities. The experts argue that the LCFS in particular awards credits to farmers at a much higher magnitude than the cost to operate and maintain a methane digester. The aforementioned study goes on to say it believes the value of LCFS credits for large, confined animal feeding operations (CAFO) like California’s dairy farms, massively exceeds the costs of recovering the biomethane itself.

Furthermore, the biomethane energy still burns the same as fossil fuels, despite being marketed as a clean alternative. This is where the topic of greenwashing comes into play, but how exactly is BMW involved in a biogas industry projected to more than double globally to $126.2 billion by 2030? Like many things dairy related, it starts in California.

BMW’s biomethane energy offsets border greenwashing

In April of 2021, BMW Group announced a new venture as the first automaker to begin collaborating with dairy farms in California to offset the charging carbon emissions from its EVs. At the time, BMW relayed that credits through the LCFS enable charging incentives for drivers participating in its ChargeForward program that began around the same time.

These collaborations included Straus Organic Dairy Farm and CalBio who builds the methane digestors farms use. BMW North America’s energy services Manager, connected eMobility Adam Langton spoke at the time:

Our sustainability mission isn’t simply about reducing carbon emissions but making sustainability practices financially attractive for the long-run, so that these practices can expand and help our partners thrive. Dairy biodigesters are an example of an energy technology that not only reduces carbon emissions in a sustainable way but also offers a new revenue stream to farmers and their communities. In the future, we hope to use this collaborative model we have created in California to support more biodigester development in the US and ultimately bring more clean energy sources to our customers.

Third-generation farmer and owner of Bar 20 Dairy Steve Shehadey shared a similar sentiment in the video you can view below, explaining that no matter your farm’s dairy output, farmers have no control over the fluctuating prices of milk:

There’s times when you’re making money, there’s times when you’re losing money. And so, the concept of being able to produce energy or power was attractive because, if you can stabilize some income, it helps to you get you through the tough times.

According to Shehadey, Bar 20’s two solar projects and the methane digester produce an excess of 3 million kWh of power more than what the dairy farm needs to operate. The implementation of renewables like solar on farms is commendable, and capturing methane to recycle is a better option than letting it simply enter the Earth’s atmosphere.

However, there is greenwashing at play here no matter how BMW or anyone else tries to spin it, as these recycled gases are still emitting hefty carbon emissions and are empowered by an incentive program that rewards farms for the more stinky gas they produce.

Bar 20 Dairy’s methan digester / Credit: YouTube/Bank of the West

A 2022 article by the Guardian points to the same research by the Union of Concerned Scientists, arguing that the environmental benefits of biogases are immensely exaggerated and the LCFS prioritizes farm gas (a combustion-based source of energy) over other renewables like solar and wind.

According to a 2018 analysis by researchers at UC Davis, methane digesters are likely not profitable without the government grants and subsidies, finding it costs $294 a year to produce $68 of gas from one cow, not including the massive upfront cost of installing the digester itself.

This is where it gets interesting.

According to a 2021 analysis by Aaron Smith, professor of agricultural economics at UC Davis, LCFS credits generate a subsidy of $1,935 a year per cow. If dairy farmer’s needed a reason to start recycling cow poop, that’s a pretty lucrative one, especially in a fluid pricing market for dairy – having a financial contingency for selling excess energy feels like a no brainer for farmers, especially those with large operations.

A main argument by the Union of Concerned Scientists is that subsidies in the LCFS vastly eclipse the cost of producing the methane gas, disproportionally benefiting the largest and most pollutive dairy farms. On an even more disheartening note, these incentives threaten dairy industry consolidation, where the largest farms get bigger, and the smaller ones can no longer compete. Not to mention that dollar signs attached to biogas production could sway farmers away from cleaner sources of renewable energy, again such as wind and solar. Per its study:

The LCFS is structured to require producers of polluting transportation fuels to bear the costs of mitigating transportation fuel pollution. However, in the case of the manure biomethane, the majority of the climate pollution at stake is methane from manure, and the fossil methane displacement in the transportation fuel market is a relatively small contribution. Thus, in this instance the largest polluter is the one receiving a large subsidy. The lifecycle basis of the LCFS is supposed to ensure that support for low carbon fuels is based on a comprehensive assessment of their climate benefits. However, in this instance, this structure is functioning as poorly designed offset program with transportation fuel users paying an extremely high price for manure methane mitigation. This is not good transportation fuel policy or good agricultural methane mitigation policy.

It’s completely understandable why California dairy farmers who participate in methane biofuel production thanks to the current subsidies in place to their benefit. It’s truly doubtful that there is ill intent toward the environment in this process, as it does provide a partial solution to a serious emissions problem in the state. However, its benefits are highly exaggerated to the point of greenwashing, so it’s tough to give companies like BMW a pat on the back for their collaborations in the venture.

There are certainly cleaner ways to power EVs, especially without carbon offsets.",The greenwashing of cow poop harvesting. Should BMW be involved?

BMW announced that models that are part of the Neue Klasse vehicles it intends to start launching in 2025 will feature plastic parts made using recycled fishing nets and ropes. Although that may not sound all that new, the automaker is actually using an exclusive technique that is found nowhere else in the automotive industry.

By partnering with Denmark’s PLASTIX, BMW has helped develop a new processing technique that allows old maritime refuse to be transformed into plastic granules. That raw material can then be added to new plastic and molded into trim pieces that are sturdy enough to be installed on the interior or exterior of a vehicle.

You may already be familiar with the concept of recycling fishing nets and ropes, because it has been used in other vehicles, such as the BMW iX and the new X1, as well as in vehicles from other manufacturers like Mercedes.

That material, known as ECONYL, is made from maritime waste, material from old floor coverings and residual waste from plastic production. Currently, though, the material is mostly spun into fibers and woven into automotive carpets.

That’s great, but this new strategy allows the recycled material to be used in the injection molding process for the first time. That reduces the use of new plastic in trim pieces by up to 30 percent, shrinking their carbon footprint by around 25 percent. It also means that more old nets and ropes are collected, preventing them from being discarded in the sea.

BMW says that it will use this new, greener plastic in parts that are visible on the Neue Klasse vehicles, as well as those that aren’t starting in 2025. Part of the automaker’s wider environmental goals, it hopes to increase its use of recycled materials in thermoplastics from 20 percent to 40 percent by 2030.",BMW Finds New Ways To Use Plastic Recycled From Old Fishing Nets With Exclusive Process

They include the use of maritime waste for injection-moulded plastic parts, recycling of steel, aluminium and glass, and the recycling of battery cells.

The carmaker said it already currently uses almost 30% of recycled and reusable materials in the manufacture of its vehicles but aims to gradually increase this figure to 50% while maintaining quality, safety and reliability standards equal to those parts made with primary materials.

Key to those goals is a reduction in the variety of materials sourced. The company said the use of mono-materials contributes significantly to simplified recycling and the improved purity of secondary raw materials. That applies to textiles, plastics and metal alloys.

Cleaner plastic

With regard to recycled plastic, BMW is taking discarded fishing nets and ropes recovered from the ocean to produce plastic granules that be used for injection-moulded trim components. The carmaker said the raw materials used in the components can consist of around 30% maritime waste. The trim parts will be used in visible and non-visible areas on both the exterior and interior of its Neue Klasse (New Class) EVs from 2025.

BMW said it was aiming to double the proportion of secondary materials in the production of thermoplastics from the current 20% to 40% by 2030. Switching from primary to secondary materials also reduces CO2 emissions in the manufacture of thermoplastic components by 50 to 80%, according to the company.

BMW is also working on a pilot project with chemical company BASF, and recycling and environmental services provider Alba, on a material cycle for plastics that will enable it to end the use of crude oil as a raw material. Alongside that it is looking into the use of bio-based plastics and plastics reinforced with natural fibres such as cellulose, hemp, wood or bamboo.

Steel, aluminium and glass

BMW said it is also aiming to gradually increase the use of secondary raw materials in steel components from the current average of around 25%. Depending on the alloy, the carmaker said that between 50 and 80% of the CO2 emissions in the production process could be avoided by using secondary materials.

BMW is further ahead with aluminium components, which already contain up to 50% secondary raw materials. One good example is in the cast aluminium used for wheels on the Mini Countryman, where secondary aluminium will lead to a reduction of 75 to 85% in CO2 emissions associated with production compared to the use of primary materials.

BMW reports it has been dismantling and recycling components for two decades and is “committed to establishing a circular economy within the automotive industry, especially for steel, aluminium, glass and plastics”.

In terms of glass, it is working on establishing a circular economy for vehicle windows by 2030. It said dismantling, sorting and reusing automotive glass could reduce CO2 emissions in window production by up to 30% compared to using new material.

Renewable energy

At the same time, BMW is looking at using primary steel that has been made produced using cleaner energy. From 2025 it will source steel from a Swedish manufacturer that uses hydrogen and electricity from renewable sources. It has signed another agreement with a supplier for the procurement of steel from CO2-reduced production. It said that 40% of requirements for vehicle production at the European BMW Group plants can be covered in this way. That would be equal to a reduction in CO2 emissions through steel production of around 400,000 tonnes annually.

The BMW Group has been sourcing aluminium produced using electricity generated from solar energy since February 2021. That solar power comes from the United Arab Emirates.

“A long-term increase in deliveries of aluminium produced using green electricity is planned, with the aim of reducing CO2 emissions in this area by a total of around 2.5m tonnes by 2030,” said the carmaker in a statement. “From 2024 onwards, all cast aluminium wheels sourced by the BMW Group will be produced using only green electricity.”

Battery cells

BMW Group is also working on making the production of lithium-ion batteries more sustainable through the re-use of battery cell materials, a process it said would be industrialised once there were substantial numbers of end-of-life EVs and a significant number of old batteries.

The carmaker is currently working with German recycling specialist Duesenfeld on a process that aims to achieve a recycling rate of more than 95%, including for graphite and electrolytes.

In China, the BMW Brilliance Automotive joint venture (BBA) has already established a closed loop for reuse of the raw materials nickel, lithium and cobalt from high-voltage batteries. It said the raw materials obtained through recycling conserves resources and reduces CO2 emissions by around 70% compared to using newly extracted primary material.

BMW is also cutting carbon from the logistics used to supply the parts to those plants and from the delivery process used to get the assembled vehicles to the customer.

More specifically, it has plans to reduce carbon emissions within supply chain by 20% by 2030. That means, among other things, a much closer collaboration with logistics and transport providers, a focus on digital tools for data gathering on carbon emissions in the supply chain and a much greater emphasis on sustainability in the purchasing of services.

The BMW Group is the first automotive manufacturer worldwide to use matt paints made from biomass instead of crude oil at its European plants. In addition to this, BMW Group Plants Leipzig and Rosslyn (South Africa) are also using sustainably-produced corrosion protection.

The BMW Group has chosen to use BASF Coatings’ CathoGuard 800 ReSource e-coat at its plants in Leipzig, Germany, and Rosslyn, South Africa, and the iGloss matt ReSource clearcoat throughout Europe. Using these more sustainable product versions for vehicle coatings enables CO 2 avoidance of around 40% per coating layer; this will reduce the amount of CO 2 emitted in the plants by more than 15,000 metric tons by 2030.

The BMW Group produces an average of around 250,000 vehicles every year at its plants in Leipzig and Rosslyn.

As a corrosion protection technology with optimum protection of edges, the CathoGuard 800 e-coat helps millions of cars live longer. Its biomass-balanced version, CathoGuard 800 ReSource, adds a reduced carbon footprint to the e-coat application’s material efficiency, without changing the product’s formulation.

BASF’s innovative production process makes it possible to replace petroleum-based precursors, such as naphtha, with renewable raw materials from organic waste, starting in the early stages of paint production. This not only reduces consumption of fossil resources, but also avoids the CO 2 emissions associated with the production, transport and processing of crude oil.

The corrosion protection and matt paints used at BMW Group Plants Leipzig and Rosslyn are chemically identical to the paints previously used, with all the same properties as conventionally manufactured body coatings. Since bio-based and conventional coatings are produced on the same line, BASF adopts an externally certified mass balance approach.

For the BMW Group, this is another step towards its goal of creating the most sustainable supply chain in the automotive industry. The transition applies, in particular, to the energy-intensive electrolysis used in producing aluminum and to the wheel-casting process. To this end, corresponding agreements have been reached with all BMW Group wheel suppliers.

Up until now, wheels have accounted for about five percent of supply chain carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions. Transitioning to more sustainable production that relies on green power will reduce these emissions by more than half. The BMW Group procures about 10 million light-alloy wheels per year; 95% of these are made from cast aluminum.

CO 2 savings of up to 500,000 tonnes per year

Through independent audits, the BMW Group can ensure conscious and sustainable use of aluminum by its contracted producers, saving up to 500,000 tonnes of CO 2 per year.

“Green power is one of the biggest levers for reducing CO 2 emissions in our supply chain. We have already signed more than 400 contracts with our suppliers, including suppliers of wheels and aluminum, requiring them to use green power,” says Joachim Post, member of the Board of Management of BMW AG responsible for Purchasing and Supplier Network.

Aluminum has good recycling properties, making it easier to melt down old wheels as part of the circular economy. This eliminates the need for energy-intensive electrolysis to produce the primary raw material. At the same time, the secondary raw material must also meet the BMW Group’s premium requirements for quality, design, safety and mechanical properties.

MINI pioneers use of sustainable light-alloy cast wheels

MINI will become a pioneer in this field in 2023 when it will begin using light-alloy cast wheels made from 70% secondary aluminum in the new generation of the MINI Countryman. The combination of 100% green power for production and 70% secondary raw material content can reduce CO 2 emissions by up to 80%, compared to conventional manufacturing processes.

Certification by Aluminium Stewardship Initiative (ASI)

The BMW Group has been actively involved for many years in international initiatives focused on standardizing raw material extraction. These include the Aluminium Stewardship Initiative (ASI), an international non-profit organization supported by environmental and industrial associations, NGOs, aluminum producers and processing companies. The BMW Group welcomes the fact that many of its aluminum wheel suppliers have already joined ASI and are making an important contribution to creating an environmentally and socially responsible aluminum value chain in this way.

ASI already certified the light metal foundry at BMW Group Plant Landshut in December 2019 for its sustainable use of aluminum, confirming that it handles aluminum consciously and responsibly.

Systematic implementation of sustainability goals

Transitioning to 100% green power for production of cast aluminum wheels is another step toward reducing CO 2 emissions in the BMW Group supplier network. The aim is to reduce emissions throughout the supply chain by 20% from 2019 levels by 2030. Systematically increasing the percentage of secondary aluminum through this process makes a further contribution to sustainability, in line with the principles of the circular economy the BMW Group aspires to.

Since 2021, the BMW Group has sourced aluminum from the United Arab Emirates manufactured exclusively using electricity obtained from solar power. The aluminum produced in Dubai is processed in the light metal foundry at BMW Group Plant Landshut, where it is used to manufacture body and drive train components.

The mid-size sedan concept previews the styling language and tech for the brand's upcoming Neue Klasse of EVs, the first of which will go into production in 2025 in the form of a 3 Series-sized electric sedan. Mind you, BMW says the design of the i Vision Dee – where ""Dee"" stands for Digital Emotional Experience – has been deliberately pared down for CES to focus attention on the digital experience and the DNA of the BMW brand.

Key exterior styling features include the classic three-box sedan design and reimagined BMW kidney grille, twin circular headlights and Hofmeister kink, with ""phygital"" (fusion of physical and digital) icons replacing analog elements.

The vehicle is also equipped with full-color E Ink technology and can present its exterior in up to 32 colors – or combine them – courtesy of an ePaper film that covers the entire body, which is divided into 240 individually controlled E Ink segments. This is an evolution of the black-and-white BMW iX Flow Featuring E Ink unveiled at CES 2022.

Inside, digitalization goes hand in hand with minimalism, with BMW offering as few materials, operating controls and displays as possible to ensure nothing distracts from the digital experience.

Another element worth mentioning is the unconventional steering wheel with a central vertical spoke and touch points that come to life when approached or touched by the driver's thumb. These touch points control selection of the content projected onto the windscreen and, together with the Head-Up Display, support the principle of ""hands on the wheel, eyes on the road.""

Speaking of the Head-Up Display, it extends across the full width of the windscreen, which only becomes recognizable as a display once it is activated. BMW says this feature will also be found on the models of the Neue Klasse from 2025, adding that it demonstrates the huge potential of projection technology. We would add that it's refreshing to see a new vehicle that doesn't have a giant screen on the dashboard.

The BMW Mixed Reality Slider is the central operating control of BMW i Vision Dee. Working together with the Head-Up Display, the system enables the driver to decide how much digital content they want to see on the windscreen by using shy-tech sensors on the instrument panel.

The five-step selection ranges from analog, to driving-related info, to the contents of the communications system, to augmented-reality projection, and to entry into virtual worlds. Speaking of the latter, the windows can be dimmed to gradually fade out reality, allowing passengers to experience mixed reality in an immersive way without requiring any additional tools.

Another interesting feature of the BMW i Vision Dee is the personalized welcome scenario, which combines graphical elements, light and sound effects. The headlights and the closed BMW kidney grille form a common icon on a uniform surface, allowing the vehicle to produce different facial expressions.

According to BMW, ""the i Vision Dee can talk to people and, at the same time, express moods such as joy, astonishment or approval visually."" It can also project an image of the driver's avatar onto the side window to further personalize the welcome scenario.



Unfortunately, we don't get to learn anything about the Vision i Dee's powertrain, but BMW says it will provide further insights and glimpses of the revolutionary vehicle concept of the Neue Klasse over the course of this year.",BMW i Vision Dee Debuts At CES As Window Into Neue Klasse Of EVs

Almost every company is talking sustainability and ESG these days, but do you actually see these goals put into action. Here’s a good example of walking the talk.

BMW Group Malaysia recently commemorated their partnership with Pentas Flora in an MoU signing, held in conjunction with a roundtable discussion on ESG (that’s environmental, social and governance) hosted by the automaker. Pentas Flora, a long-time customer of BMW Group Financial Services, is one of Malaysia’s largest incumbent re-refined fuel oil providers, specialising in managing scheduled waste for clients across industries.

Over 30,000 litres of waste oils and lubricants have been collected from four participating BMW dealerships in the Klang Valley so far, sent for processing at Pentas Flora’s re-refinery plant in Banting to eventually be turned into re-refined eco base oil (EBO) that will be channelled back into the automotive sector.

Re-refined oil is a complex but highly reliable product that goes through vacuum distillation, pre-treatment processes such as sieving, dewatering, vacuum dehydration, short path distillation, and a variety of treatment processes to obtain a quality end-product comparable to virgin base oil, BMW says.

“For us at BMW Group Malaysia, our vision for sustainability is clear. In all our efforts to mitigate climate change, we ensure our strategy is both circular and responsible – as we pursue a verifiable and consistent path towards climate neutrality by 2050. In doing so, we drive forward the Group’s global ambition here with a local context, while inspiring more Malaysian industry leaders to place ESG at the forefront of their decision-making in 2023,” said Hans de Visser, MD of BMW Group Malaysia.

“This partnership is a meaningful one for us at Pentas Flora as we recognise the shared commitment between our organisations in championing sustainability and responsibility in our business processes, preserving the environment and ensuring that elements that can be harmful to the earth can be disposed in a responsible manner,” said Oon Kin Seng, group executive director of Pentas Flora.

“Ultimately, our work in managing scheduled waste for clients across industries by providing end-to-end solutions for hazardous waste management, is part of a larger vision to build a sustainable environment and a better future for all Malaysians and we are pleased to be able to drive its importance with a partner like BMW Group Malaysia,” he added.

As part of BMW Group Malaysia’s RE:GENERATE programme to adopt circularity within the organisation, this collaboration with Pentas Flora is a crucial first step to ensuring not only proper automotive waste management, but also a firm departure from the traditional linear approach to valuable resources, the company says.

The goal is to achieve 100% participation in repurposing used oils and lubricants from all BMW dealers nationwide, while also encouraging more industry players to pay closer attention to waste management, ensuring that waste is no longer carelessly deposited into landfills, incinerated, or illegally dumped.","BMW Malaysia recycles service centre waste oil and lube with Pentas Flora, 30k litres collected from 4 SCs"

Many automakers were announcing deadlines by which they would stop selling ICE vehicles altogether, buoyed by investment analysts and favorable press. But BMW decided to focus on lifecycle emissions and pursued a flexible powertrain strategy by offering vehicles with several options: gasoline and diesel-fueled ICE, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, and battery electric vehicles. That approach received a frostier reception in the stock market.

In mid-2022, automakers, consumers, regulators, and investors were focusing on the transition from internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles to electric vehicles (EV). While this would reduce tail-pipe emissions, it ignored the fact that the production of EVs—and especially their batteries—increases emissions in the supply chain.

BRIAN KENNY: On April 3, 2020, a woman in Punjab, India posted a photo of the Himalayas on Twitter, taken from her rooftop – and it went viral. The photo itself was unremarkable. It became a sensation because that particular view simply hadn’t existed before that day, which came three weeks after the city was effectively shut down by COVID. Three weeks was all it took to wipe away the cloak of air pollution that obscured the iconic mountain range. The same phenomenon was taking place around the world as photos revealing deep blue skies emerged from the likes of Beijing, Rio, and LA. Scientists say that CO2 emissions dropped by as much as 7% in that period, the largest drop in history and the kind of impact we could expect if say, half of the drivers in the world converted to electric vehicles. But that of course is a big if. Today on Cold Call, we’ve invited Professor Shirley Lu to discuss the case entitled, “Driving Decarbonization at BMW.” I’m your host, Brian Kenny, and you’re listening to Cold Call on the HBR Podcast Network. Shirley Lu conducts research in the area of corporate social responsibility disclosure with a focus on topics related to climate change and gender diversity. Thank you for joining me today, Shirley.

SHIRLEY LU: Thank you for having me.

BRIAN KENNY: We’re going to touch on a couple of those topics today. So this is perfectly timely, and I think this case for me was super eye-opening in a lot of ways. I mean, I don’t have an electric vehicle. I’ve thought about getting one. And there’s some complications with electric vehicles that I think we’re going to get into and that BMW has certainly considered as they move down this path towards decarbonization. And they are sort of a bit of an outlier in terms of their competitors in this space. So I think it’s going to be really interesting for people to hear you talk about that. So thanks for writing the case and thanks for being here to talk about it. Why don’t we just get started right away here. If you want to begin by telling us what the central issue is in the case and what your question is to start the conversation in the classroom.

SHIRLEY LU: Absolutely. I see this case as a decarbonization 101 case for the students, where they learn the basics of carbon accounting, carbon management, but also strategies that today a lot of companies are facing this transition to a low carbon economy. So, I go in the classroom and start by saying that one of those industries is the automobile industry that is facing tremendous amount of pressure coming from regulators, investors. And they’re really focusing on this transition from internal combustion engines. I’ll call that ICE, to electrical vehicles, EVs, which really focuses on the tailpipe emissions. And so, our question for the student and the cold call is: why is BMW focusing on emissions across the entire value chain? So that will start from the supply chain to their own production and then to the use phase tailpipe emissions.

BRIAN KENNY: Now, I teased a little bit in the introduction about your areas of research. We always are interested in what motivates faculty to drill into a particular topic. I’m wondering why you decided to write this case.

SHIRLEY LU: Yes. First of all, I want to highlight this is also a joint work with two other amazing professors here, George Serafeim and Mike Toffel. And they were both kind of experts in decarbonization and thus great research there. So I definitely learned a lot from this process. And this is my first case. So, my hope is both to learn the art of case writing, but also that to do research in a climate space, I think the practice is moving very fast. So for example, the best practices, the challenges. In particular, I’m curious about the credibility of environmental disclosure. All of these are better learned in practice as opposed to having a lot of archival data. And so that’s why for me it’s really important to early on in the career to see how companies are actually doing these carbon accounting and management.

BRIAN KENNY: This is a pretty ambitious one and Mike and George are great. They’ve both been on the show and this is as good a time as any for me to plug Mike’s podcast Climate Rising, Mike Toffel is the host of that, cases like this are the kinds of conversations that he’s having with leaders in this field all the time. So, that’s awesome. Let’s talk about BMW. Everybody knows BMW. They make really nice expensive fast cars. You don’t necessarily think about them as a maker of EVs per se. You think about that stick shift on the floor and the sort of racing vibe that you get. Can you talk a little bit about their history as an automotive maker and the culture within the company?

SHIRLEY LU: BMW was founded in 1916 in Munich, Germany. And initially they actually produced aircraft engines and gradually moving to automobile engines and then automobile cars. And I think they’re best known for being the ultimate driving machine by having really strong engines.

BRIAN KENNY It’s great marketing right there, the ultimate driving machine.

SHIRLEY LU: And hence that transition to EV will be interesting. And two things I want to highlight about that culture when we visited a company. The first one that really comes off a lot when we talked to the employees there is this belief of under promise and over deliver. And so whenever they make a promise, they’ll make sure they deliver it, and if not, they’d rather not make the promise. And for example, when you look at EV, they talk about their driving range. So, when BMW releases a driving range and then someone independent goes in and test it, it’s actually probably longer than the one they listed. Whereas the other companies, it may be the opposite.

BRIAN KENNY: That’s pretty smart actually on their part, I think.

SHIRLEY LU: And then the second part about their culture is they’re very metric target driven, very quantitative. So, they set clear targets. And what’s interesting is everyone in the company owns a bit of that target. What we see is everyone knows the overarching target. So, down to every engineer, when they designed one component for the car, they have a part of that target. So, when I meant target, I mean the decarbonization target. They focused on sustainability starting way back in 1970s, but that’s when they first hire an environmental officer for the purpose of complying with environmental regulations. And then in 2000 is when they defined sustainability as part of their overarching strategy. And starting in 2007, that’s when they started developing the first battery electrical vehicle inside of the company. And that’s a time when there’s no mass produced BEV on the market, before the times of Tesla. And then in 2013 is when they release that EV, which is I3 model. And what’s fascinating is they try to have a EV that has the lowest emissions across the entire value chain, that even the door, they say if you compost a door, you put it on the ground, it will be composted.

BRIAN KENNY: I’ve seen the I3 and the I4, and some of them are a complete departure from what you would expect to see from BMW. So I’m wondering when they introduced these models, how were they viewed? How were they received by people?

SHIRLEY LU: It is quite divided. So, there are some that find it very revolutionary. It’s very different from their traditional cars. It’s very beautiful. To me, it looks a little cute even.

BRIAN KENNY: Right.

SHIRLEY LU: But on the other hand, you also have some critics saying that the market’s simply not ready. And they say it’s because they came up with an I3 so early in the game that’s why right now they’re a laggard in the EV game.

BRIAN KENNY: Okay. And who else are they competing with in this space? Who else is introducing models like this?

SHIRLEY LU: There are two types of players. First of all, you have the newer startups type company like Tesla and like XPeng or NIO in China that are all producing only electrical vehicles. But at the same time, a lot of the traditional automobile companies like Mercedes, like Ford, GM, they’re also facing this transition and pushing out their version of BEVs, battery electrical vehicles.

BRIAN KENNY: So, several of their competitors have already put a stake in the ground about when they’re planning to go completely cut away from ICE vehicles and go completely electric. Is that right?

SHIRLEY LU: Yes. For example, Mercedes say they will be ready to go all electric at the end of the decade where market conditions allow. And also at COP26, a lot of companies including Ford, Mercedes, General Motors, they signed a declaration to essentially ban ICE by 2040. And that’s no later than 2035 in the leading markets.

BRIAN KENNY: But BMW has not put that stake in the ground.

SHIRLEY LU: Exactly. So BMW is not making that statement, and instead they’re focusing on having a flexible powertrain strategy. So, by that, it means if you’re a customer and you want a particular type of car, you should be able to choose having an electrical battery inside or an internal combustion engine inside. So, you should leave that option to customers. And part of that reason is customers have different driving habits. So, some may be using a car for professional reasons, some may be using for leisure, for commute, some may in rural, some maybe in urban areas. And there’s this concern from the customer that the battery power cannot last for such a high range. And they call that a range anxiety, as one potential-

BRIAN KENNY: I have range anxiety. That’s one of the reasons why I haven’t made the move to the electric vehicle.

SHIRLEY LU: Exactly. And also the lack of charging infrastructure that when you go into oil station, you can just charge quite instantly. For EV, you have to charge for half an hour at the moment, the current technology. So, it’s adding that pressure. But what’s interesting here is in reality, the average driving distance is not that long for a trip. In the US for example, the average daily driving is less than 30 miles, but an EV’s range can go up to 300 miles.

BRIAN KENNY: Right. So, you’re saying that my anxiety is unwarranted as most people’s anxiety is probably unwarranted.

SHIRLEY LU: But again, it depends on the use case.

BRIAN KENNY: Yeah, yeah. And I would imagine that this strategy that they have pursued, I mean it makes sense to the extent that they’re able to meet the needs of the customer regardless of whether they’re looking for an electric vehicle or a combustion vehicle. But it’s got to be taxing on them as an organization because now they have two manufacturing processes, they have two sets of suppliers. It’s got to be complicated. So I can imagine that Mercedes and the other firms that have put this stake in the ground are saying, We’re converting everything because it’s just going to be a more fluid process for us.

SHIRLEY LU: Part of the reason for staying flexible, I think also relates to their experience with two other major trends in the automobile industry. So, you may have heard the three major trends are automation, ride sharing, and electrification. And with the first two, BMW invested in technology that relates to ride sharing and automation driving. The technology of the market is not quite there yet and end up they have to write off these investments. And so when it comes to the electrification, they’re also being very careful with the timing that they’ll keep it flexible. And again, relating back to their culture of not trying to overpromise. So that’s why I think partly they’re not going to give a date by which we’re going to ban internal combustion engine before they’re certain they can do that.

BRIAN KENNY: So, what’s the regulatory environment look like around EVs?

SHIRLEY LU: There is a lot of regulations coming out, and I think they’re the catalyst for this transition from internal combustion engine to EVs. For example, the EU parliament approved the ban of selling new ICE, new combustion engine by 2035.

BRIAN KENNY: Okay.

SHIRLEY LU: California also announced similar rules and other states like Massachusetts and New York are considering following. So the regulatory environment, I think it’s another big push. That’s why a lot of companies are also using those dates. 2035. That’s when we are going to also ban ICE.

BRIAN KENNY: Okay. So that puts a lot of pressure on BMW to put a date out there to put a stake in the ground. Are they suffering any consequences from not actually taking that step?

SHIRLEY LU: Yes and no. So, on the yes side, there are media articles that are calling them the EV laggard. And there’s even a social impact investor that comes out and say they are the Blackberry of the automobile industry. But on the other hand, potentially no. Because the more sophisticated analysts or investors may be able to see that BMW is still investing a lot in the EV technology. And even if you look at their actual sales of EV, it is higher than some of their traditional competitors.

BRIAN KENNY: And for those who remember Blackberries, by the way, they were really good, and they’re making a comeback. I think people are…

SHIRLEY LU: Really?

BRIAN KENNY: Yeah. Yeah. They’re pining for those again. Those and flip phones, who knew? Let’s talk about what exactly they’re measuring and reporting on within the EV cars themselves. And I think that begins with the GHG, the greenhouse gas protocol. Can you just describe as succinctly as possible, because I know it’s a very complicated measure, what exactly are they looking at with GHG?

SHIRLEY LU: Yes. And that’s what we hope the students can learn from that. The current way they measure carbon is through the greenhouse gas protocol and they divide greenhouse gases into three buckets. And first of all, there’s more than one greenhouse gas. They will aggregate everything in terms of a carbon equivalent in terms of the global warming potentials. So let’s call that carbon for now, carbon equivalent. So they separate those into three buckets. Scope one, two, and three. Scope one is the company’s direct emissions. So, for example, BMW burns certain fossil fuel for their paint shop. And so, that’ll be scope one direct emissions. Scope two is the electricity they purchase, and that has some emissions associated with that. Scope three is everything else. So for BMW, scope one and two is in total only 1% of their total emissions. Scope three, everything else can be separated into the supply chain and the use phase. Supply chain is around 15%, whereas the use phase is 80% of emissions.

BRIAN KENNY: Okay. And is that the use of the actual customer in the vehicle itself?

SHIRLEY LU: The use phase, exactly. That will be when the customers drive the car. And then the tailpipe emissions, that’s also being considered on BMW’s books.

BRIAN KENNY: Where are they focusing their decarbonization efforts? What are they looking at?

SHIRLEY LU: And that is back to our cold call question. Yeah, they look at the full value chain. So they set a science-based target, which are targets that can align with the scenario to limit the global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees. And so for them, the target is by 2030, per car, the scope one and two emissions, they want to reduce it by 80%. So that is quite ambitious. And part of the reason is, this is their own emissions. They need to own it, and really show they’re making a sincere effort. Scope three supply chain is 22% reduction. But in reality, to achieve that, it’s much harder. The reason is by converting to electrical vehicle, you’re having the battery. The battery increases your supply chain emissions by around 50%. So in total, for them, a true reduction of 22% really feels like a 70% reduction. And finally, scope three use phase, which is the driving. And that’s more depends on the car they sell that one they hope to reduce by 50%.

BRIAN KENNY: So, they are putting targets against all of these. And as you said, they’re ambitious targets, which flies a little bit in the face of their under-promise and over-deliver strategy. But what are some of the issues that they’ve run into as they try to make these goals?

SHIRLEY LU: Exactly. I think initially when they first set the targets, they are quite reasonable. And there will be surprises they learn afterwards that made it harder to achieve potentially. And I think it’s not unique to BMW. A lot of companies, they set a target, but how to achieve it? It’s a learning process. In the case of BMW. Let me share three surprises they had-

BRIAN KENNY: Okay.

SHIRLEY LU: … that are challenges. The first one is realizing a lot of the decarbonization opportunities are not readily available everywhere. So when they think about changing to solar and wind power, but not all the plants have the same amount of sunlight or wind. And so, when they plant at a high level and then realizing at the local level, it is not fully available. The second is some of the processes turn out to be more expensive. So, for example, electrification is a major step towards decarbonization because if you electrify all of your process, you don’t need to burn fossil fuel anymore. So that lowers emission, and then you can then move into using renewable energy to really transition to closer to almost zero emissions. But for them, they realized that to electrify for example the paint shop, that will mean they have to stop the operation and really rebuild the facility. And that is more costly than they initially thought. Whereas if they build a new facility with the new technology and become electrified to begin with, that is actually cheaper and that’s what they’re going for as well.

BRIAN KENNY: Okay. So scopes one and two are somewhat within their control, but difficult nonetheless. Scope three is really hard because now they start to dive into the supply chain. How deep are they going into the supply chain?

SHIRLEY LU: Very deep. Ideally, it’s all of the supply chain.

BRIAN KENNY: Wow.

SHIRLEY LU: But then as you imagine some of them four or five tiers down their supply chain, how are they going to get the measurements? And that speaks to one issue in the carbon accounting for scope three supply chain, which is this issue of primary versus secondary data. Ideally you get primary data, which is the real number that contributes to the tire, to the steel that you acquired. But then, because they don’t have such detailed information right now, they will use industry averages. So for example, steel produced in this region under this method as an average emissions of this number. And that’s what they’ll use on their books. And you can imagine the problem with this is, well then you are not compensating for firms that are greener.

BRIAN KENNY: The case goes into the Catena-X approach. How does that help them in this focus on phase three?

SHIRLEY LU: This is an industry effort that they are one of the pioneers in it. The idea is to build almost something like a blockchain for emissions data, where within the automobile industry, all of the suppliers will put their information on that chain. And Catena-X, actually the “Catena” stands for chain in Greek. And so, it’s the idea that if they all put in their data, then they can have this primary data. But you can imagine the challenge, it’s also how do you coordinate with everyone in the industry?

BRIAN KENNY: There’s also a big emphasis on recycling within the automotive space. The case goes into some of the complications of using recycled batteries in just recycled materials in general. Can you talk a little bit about that?

SHIRLEY LU: And that’s actually the third surprise that I wanted to mention earlier with recycling. The surprises with recycling is that it’s difficult to have a closed loop. So some of the materials like aluminum, you need a higher quality for automobile industry, you need higher purity, let’s say purity. Whereas for Coca-Cola can you also need aluminum, but that’s of a lower quality. And the issue is some of the cars being recycled, the aluminum were used to produce Coca-Cola cans. So, you actually lose that same purity of aluminum, which are not going back into the automobile industry. So, these are some of the issues, how can you get back the material? So the same with battery. The battery is even more important to have recycling because of the rare minerals that is of limited supply. And so, who can really keep the battery to their own company, to their own production can really dominate the market. And one thing they mentioned that’s interesting is in China, the requirement is that whoever produces the battery, the company, so if BMW sells a car with a battery, BMW has to recycle that battery. Whereas in the rest of the world, there’s no such a regulation. So the question becomes who gets those recycled batteries?

BRIAN KENNY: I was really surprised to read in the case that there are ICE vehicles in the BMW line that have lower emissions than some of their EVs, which made me say, “Well, why are they doing this at all?” Because that throws up a big red flag. But maybe you can talk a little bit about why an ICE vehicle would have lower emissions than a smaller size EV.

SHIRLEY LU: And that really depends on a few factors.

BRIAN KENNY: Okay.

SHIRLEY LU: That is actually one of the major exercises we have the students do in class. We share an Excel file with them with all the emissions numbers and ask them to tweak certain assumptions. And in particular, we ask them to tweak where the battery’s being produced, what is the local grids emissions and how long do you drive the car for? And these factors, let me highlight two key things here. So, the first one is the transition from ICE to EV is a trade-off where you lower your tailpipe emissions, but you increase the emissions from the battery. So, with ICE, you are kind of creating emissions as you drive. With the electrical vehicles, you don’t see the emissions, but you charge them using the local electricity. So, the emissions of your local electricity will determine how much emissions that process creates.

BRIAN KENNY: Very interesting.

SHIRLEY LU: And that really varies by region. So the emissions of the local grid in China, for example, is three times that of EU and twice as much as in the US. And so, in certain combinations where you don’t drive long distances, you are in a local grid with very high emissions and battery produced in regions with high emissions, there is that potential that the EV is actually dirtier than an internal combustion engine. And the other question we also ask students is, what about outside of the model? Are there some things we’re not capturing just by looking at one car scenario? And one factor is, imagine if all the cars convert to EV, let’s say right now, there’s not enough renewable energy or clean energy such that you may need to actually end up firing up more coal plants and that is higher emissions.

BRIAN KENNY: Yeah. This is part of it, the whole tension around sustainability. And we talk about this in other cases that we discuss on the show as well. This has been a really interesting conversation, Shirley. If there’s one thing you want listeners to remember about the BMW case, what would it be?

SHIRLEY LU: The measurement. You need to measure emissions because you can’t manage what you don’t measure. And with the better measurements, it helps you make better decisions. And one thing we want to highlight is emissions across the entire value chain. Sometimes by focusing on one type of emission, you end up increasing another emission. So it’s important to see the full picture. And one final thing, what I really am grateful for, is BMW for sharing with us all of their experience. And our hope, or my hope, is that some of the students who learn this will one day go into their own company and this case can show them once you have the measures, you can start making better decisions.

It is headquartered in Munich and was founded in 1916. BMW has been named one of the most sustainable automotive companies by the Supersector. Its efforts started as early as 1995 — and involved everything from reducing CO2 emissions to buying more renewable energy to selling more green cars. By 2025, it says that electric vehicles will comprise 30% of its sales, and by 2030, they will be 50%. It is also investing in cars with hydrogen fuel cells — vehicles that take just a few minutes to fill up and that don’t drain because of cold weather. The goal is to mass-produce hydrogen fuel cell cars by 2030. At the same time, BMW is designing a vehicle that is built with recycled parts — part of the I Vision project, which it expects to come to fruition in 2040.

Between 1995 and 2020, the company says it reduced its CO2 emissions by 53%. Also, in 2020, all the electricity it purchased to run its plants worldwide came from renewables. The aim is to cut its CO2 levels by 40% by 2030 and to be carbon neutral by 2050.

“Taking actions against climate change is one of our top business priorities, and we are change agents to drive green transformation across our entire value chain, from production to supply chain, logistics, and dealer management,” Franz Decker, chief executive of BMW Brilliance Automotive, in the company’s sustainability report. The central theme: sustainability is at the heart of the company’s mission — from sourcing raw materials to producing cars to driving automobiles before recycling their used parts.

The journey:

The company will reduce greenhouse gas emissions using science-based principles.

BMW will bring 7 million electrified vehicles to market, including vehicles with hydrogen fuel cells.

The CO2 emissions for each vehicle sold will get cut by at least one-third over the car’s entire life cycle.

CO2 emissions BMW’s productions will be cut too — by 80%, globally.

Cars will have recyclable parts — part of the company’s commitment to the circular economy.

BMW will work to ensure its supply chain is also sustainable. The chain does not begin with production at the BMW Group factory but rather with sourcing raw materials. BMW intends to use only materials produced using regenerative electricity sources, it says.

How will BMW achieve its climate goals?

The focus will be on the utilization phase of the vehicles — where BMW incurs 70% of its CO2 emissions. By 2030, these levels will be cut by half from a 2019 baseline. It also says that BMW will reduce CO2 levels by 40% per vehicle during this time.

Between 2017 and 2021, it says that CO2 emissions per car fell by 5.7%. Between 2006 and 2020, that figure is 78%. CO2 levels have fallen by 70% per vehicle since 2006. Its goal is to drive that down to 80% by 2030, from a 2019 baseline. It says that by 2030 carbon emissions are expected to have dropped by 90 % compared with 2006 levels.

“With emissions of around 116 grams per kilometer, according to WLTP, the company outperformed the fleet target limit of approx. 126 grams per kilometer by around ten grams in the EU, based on its own internal calculations. The key drivers for fulfilling the fleet target were significantly higher sales of electrified vehicles in Europe and further increases in efficiency for conventional drive technologies,” the sustainability statement says.

Investing in energy efficiency in its operations is a priority. It uses hydrogen, biogas, biomass, and geothermal energy. It is also reducing the demand for energy by capturing waste heat from its industrial processes and reusing it. Data analytics gives the company a holistic view of its operations, allowing it to cut electricity consumption through intelligent controls.

Tell us about BMW’s goal of becoming circular.

Humans consume more than 100 billion tons of raw materials annually — minerals that are incredibly costly to process. Moreover, it is expensive and dirty to do so. That’s why BMW says its goal is to reuse raw materials, which is cheaper than digging them out of the ground and processing them. Its I Vision circular project aims to build cars with 100% recyclable parts. Today, those BMW vehicles have 30% secondary parts. The immediate aim is to get to 50% — a goal set in 2021.

Indeed, the recovery of valuable materials is critical. In 30 countries, BMW says it has 3,000 “take-back” locations.

“The BMW Group aims to obtain high-quality secondary materials through promoting a greater degree of transparency in the recycling chain and simultaneously tracing the reuse of (secondary) raw materials within the cycle,” it says. “The use of secondary materials again significantly reduces carbon emissions in comparison to primary materials – by as much as 80 % in the case of aluminum, for example.”","BMW to Cut Emissions, Rely on Recycled Parts, Hydrogen Fuel Cells"

Brandalism has previously targeted the likes of the banking and aviation sector for their greenwashing activities / Brandalism

Brandalism took control of 400 advertising billboards and bus stops in Belgium, France, Germany and England this weekend as the European Motor Show in Brussels opened its doors on its 100th anniversary.

In the past, Brandalism has targeted the banking and aviation sectors for their greenwashing activities, but this time the group says its intention is to highlight the misleading adverts and aggressive lobbying tactics used by the automotive industry – specifically Toyota and BMW.

In 2022, Toyota was ranked the 10th worst company in the world by InfluenceMap for its anti-climate lobbying (the worst ranking of any car manufacturer), while BMW ranked 16th overall (the second worst automotive brand).

Despite Toyota and BMW ads emphasizing their electric vehicle (EV) ranges, both are still heavily invested in selling polluting combustion engine vehicles. According to a report by Greenpeace Asia, only 0.2% of cars sold by Toyota in 2021 were EVs.

The posters themselves have been installed by climate activists from the Subvertisers International, Brandalism and Extinction Rebellion groups on bus stops, billboards and tube advertising spaces in London, Berlin, Frankfurt, Paris, Nantes, Brussels, Liège, Bristol, Derby and other European towns.

The ads were designed by artists including Lindsay Grime, Michelle Tylicki, Merny Wernz, Fokawolf, Matt Bonner and Darren Cullen and feature images of highly polluting Toyota and BMW vehicles, such as the Toyota Land Cruiser and the BMW X5 and X7 SUVs.

Activists are using the action to demand more robust policies from governments to regulate the advertising of environmentally harmful products and prevent misleading green claims from big polluters.

The Europe-wide action comes at a time of growing international momentum behind the idea of introducing tobacco-style advertising bans on climate-wrecking products, such as fossil fuels and SUVs. In France, for example, car advertisements now require a caveat encouraging consumers to walk, cycle or take public transport wherever possible as part of new regulation due to come into force in March 2022.

Ahead of a UK ban on sales of petrol and diesel cars by 2030 and of hybrid vehicles by 2035, campaigners are calling for an immediate end to advertising for the most polluting vehicles – especially SUVs. Campaigners from Adfree Cities (UK), Badvertising (UK), Résistance à l’Agression Publicitaire (France), Climáximo (Portugal), Greenpeace International and 35 other organizations are calling for legislation to end adverts for high-carbon products.

Tona Merrimen, a spokesperson for Brandalism, says: “Toyota and BMW use slick marketing campaigns to promote oversized SUV models that clog up urban neighborhoods. Electric SUVs are no solution – they’re too big for most parking spaces and their tall bumper size and excessive weight present an increased risk to pedestrians, especially children, involved in road collisions.”

A spokesperson from BMW told The Drum that sustainability is an elementary part of the BMW Group’s corporate strategy. “The BMW Group is firmly committed to achieving climate neutrality by 2050 and we are adopting a scientifically validated and transparent path through the entire value chain.

“BMW was one of the first automotive brands to bring a mainstream electric vehicle to market in 2013 with the BMW i3 and by 2030, at least 50% of our global sales will be fully electric. In the short term, the company is taking steps today to reduce the total carbon footprint of our products by 40% throughout their lifecycle by 2030 compared with 2019 levels. As the first German car-maker to join the “Business Ambition for 1.5°C” and as a member of the UN’s Race to Zero program, we believe in action and continued dialogue.”

The company ranks #5 on the Cloud Wars Top 10. In this CEO Outlook moment, Klein explains to Bob Evans how SAP is helping its partners in the automotive industry.

Highlights

00:09 — Klein explains how the CEO of BMW noted the fantastic partnership between SAP and BMW, adding that he wanted to take the partnership to the next level. That meeting was where the idea for Catena-X was born.

00:42 — The idea behind Catena-X is to create a global automotive network, in which many of the CEOs “are all wanting SAP.” Supply chains are important and “they need to become more resilient,” notes Klein.

00:55 — Additionally, this global network needed help automating the manufacturing space. Klein describes how SAP built a vertical integration for automating manufacturing shop floors and predictive maintenance for equipment. SAP can successfully “automate a lot of activities around logistics and warehousing.”

01:15 — As it relates to finance, SAP is able to “connect the financial planning with the HR planning, procurement planning, and supply chain planning because you cannot plan in isolation.” In the case of BMW, the company was looking for a way to standardize and build verticals “side-by-side” with the current ERP system.

The agreement addresses BMW Group’s upstream scope 3 emissions and includes recycling and end-of-life management measures. (Earlier post.)

As part of solidifying a binding agreement, BMW Group and H2 Green Steel have also agreed on technical cooperation which will include several measures that address BMW Group’s Science Based Targets and contribute to meeting its CO 2 reduction timeline.

H2 Green Steel is committed to the Scope 1, 2 and upstream Scope 3 requirements as defined in the GHG Protocol. The company has a gross embodied carbon emission intensity obligation per tonne of steel, included in its customer contracts. H2 Green Steel’s work to reduce emissions will impact BMW Group’s material supply chain and its upstream Scope 3 emissions.

Additionally, recycling scrap is an important part of the equation which further ensures circularity. In a pioneering move, both companies have therefore agreed to have 40% of the pre-consumer steel scrap of the volumes returned to H2 Green Steel's electric arc furnaces for re-cycling.

According to H2 Green Steel’s definition of green steel, actual CO 2 reductions and improving circularity are both key. Therefore, green steel must be produced from a combination of a significant amount of green virgin iron and scrap in a production process which uses electricity from renewable energy sources. The total CO 2 emissions in such a process must be more than 90% lower than that of traditional steelmaking in a blast furnace process.

H2 Green Steel (H2GS AB) was founded in 2020 with the ambition to accelerate the decarbonization of the steel industry, using green hydrogen. Steel, which is one of the world’s largest carbon dioxide emitters, is the company’s first business vertical. The founder and largest shareholder of H2 Green Steel is Vargas, which is also co-founder and one of the larger shareholders in Swedish battery maker Northvolt. H2 Green Steel is headquartered in Stockholm, Sweden, with its first green steel plant under development in Boden, northern Sweden.

In the H2 Green Steel process, traditional blast furnace-based technology is replaced by direct reduction reactors. The direct reduction reactors have been up and running for more than 50 years in places where natural gas can be procured cheaply. In a natural gas feed reactor, the iron ore reduction takes place with both carbon monoxide to produce sponge iron and carbon dioxide and hydrogen to produce sponge iron and water. H2 Green Steel will replace the natural gas with green hydrogen to only allow for sponge iron and water to be produced.

In addition, the company will electrify every process step of the entire production flow. In this way, virtually the only emissions are steam, reducing carbon dioxide emissions by up to 90% from the outset, with the aim of reducing emissions to zero.





The plant will be fully integrated, with hot charging at each step along the production flow. This limits the amount of energy used, storage and material handling. The plant will also maximize circularity. Recycled scrap from customers will be charged into the Electric Arc Furnace, wasted heat will be sent to the district heating channels of Luleå-Boden, and slag will be processed into products to be used in other industries.",H2 Green Steel and BMW Group sign final agreement on delivery of CO2-reduced steel

Aviation accounts for about 2.5% of the world’s carbon emissions.

More fuel-efficient planes have halved commercial flights’ emissions over the past 30 years–and we are partnering with NASA to develop and test a full-scale demonstrator airplane that could inform the designs of future airplanes to be as much as 30% more fuel-efficient.

However, achieving net zero in the next 28 years will also require rethinking which non-fossil energy sources should power the aircraft itself.

The problem

When it comes to changing airplanes’ energy carriers, safety and the laws of physics rule. Finding renewable energy alternatives with the same energy density and volumetric efficiency as fossil fuels is difficult.

Today, flights over 1,000 miles account for 80% of the industry’s emissions. New batteries will enable electric aircraft to be developed for short-haul travel–but batteries weigh too much for longer flights.

Many challenges must be overcome before hydrogen-powered long-haul planes can safely complete flights, refuel, and leave for their next destinations within an hour as most do today.

Loading the smallest molecule in the universe into aircraft is tricky. Due to their small size and required cryogenic conditions, hydrogen molecules can leak through minute pores of welded seams and be absorbed into metal, since hydrogen and cooler temperatures can make metal brittle. Airports will need new infrastructure and training to safely load and handle the frigid fuel that must be chilled at -423 degrees Fahrenheit.

Storing hydrogen poses equally complicated challenges. Planes will have to be redesigned since hydrogen requires more space, as well as cryogenic conditions. Hydrogen takes up to four times the volume as jet fuel.

Hydrogen must be proven every bit as safe and practical as traditional jet fuel to be viable. That means governments will need to establish an alternative set of airworthiness requirements.

What the numbers say about reaching net zero by 2050

NASA’s inspiring Artemis 1 mission reminds us of valuable lessons for hydrogen aircraft and what it means to achieve net zero emissions by 2050.

The Space Launch System rocket we developed with NASA used supercooled hydrogen to launch the uncrewed Orion spacecraft. It is the latest in a long line of spacecraft and test aircraft to prove hydrogen-powered flight possible over the past half century. With NASA, we flew on hydrogen when Apollo 11 took humanity to the moon in 1969.

Using hydrogen directly in commercial aircraft requires substantial changes to both the aircraft and the infrastructure around it. Learning how to safely and efficiently load, store, fly and scale hydrogen-powered aircraft will be the challenge of a generation of engineers.

By contrast, short and long-range aircraft can fly on sustainable aviation fuels, or SAF, which are non-fossil certified variants of traditional petroleum jet fuel. The primary materials can be sustainable bio-based waste sources like plant oils and cooking oil, industrial capture, or even the electric grid itself. SAF can be dropped into today’s aircraft and infrastructure to mitigate emissions immediately by up to 80% over their life cycle.

While flying on hydrogen does not emit carbon, its production often does. Since most hydrogen today is produced from fossil fuels, truly reducing emissions by flying on hydrogen will also require a wholesale transformation of the energy industry to ensure sufficient so-called green hydrogen produced from renewable electricity exists for aviation. Aviation has to compete with other sectors for green hydrogen as it becomes available.

Even then, it is arithmetically impossible to replace the world’s fleets with hydrogen-powered airplanes in time to meet the industry’s 2050 target.

By the late 2030s, we estimate more than 40,000 non-hydrogen commercial jets will be in service. Each will last decades. Given that the most airplanes ever produced around the world in a year so far have been about 1,800, we can’t just switch overnight to hydrogen. Emissions from those aircraft will need to be mitigated with SAF.

Hydrogen-powered aircraft may make a small contribution to moderating emissions in 2050. And while research today may develop solutions for the latter half of the century, it must also consider the 2050 challenge at hand.

To ensure future generations can continue to fly and enjoy the other global benefits the aerospace industry contributes to a strong economy, aviation must focus on developing and scaling SAF. Advances in the science and engineering of complex hydrogen propulsion technologies should be pursued, but likely apply to the longer term.

Our founder Bill Boeing once said, “Let no new improvement in flying and flying equipment pass us by.” As the Artemis 1 mission shows, our industry achieves the seemingly unattainable. The world must scale sustainable aviation fuels that can be dropped into existing aircraft today, while exploring decarbonized propulsion technologies like hydrogen and electricity that can make an impact in the second half of the century.

Government and independent testing found contamination from Santa Susana at a neighboring children’s camp, nearby parks and residential neighborhoods. Stormwater carries chemicals off the site, exceeding government limits.

Boeing Co, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the U.S. Department of Energy share responsibility for the site – and they are on the hook to clean it up. Boeing assumed liability for a large portion of the property in 1996, when it acquired the previous co-owner, Rocketdyne. In 2007, Boeing signed an agreement with California to make 1,900 acres clean enough that people could live on the land and eat vegetables from their gardens.

But most of that cleanup never happened. Now, Boeing is pursuing an unorthodox strategy that could enable it to bypass cleaning up much of the land . The company is using a legal agreement meant to preserve nature to argue that it should be allowed to leave much of the pollution untouched.

The aerospace giant donated the property’s development rights to a land trust under an arrangement known as a “conservation easement.” Such easements, which restrict building, are intended to preserve open space, protecting scenic vistas, wildlife habitat and cultural heritage.

Boeing has held up the donation as an example of its commitment to environmental stewardship. In its 2018 annual environmental report, it quoted Stephen Thor Johnson, then president of its partner in the easement deal, the North American Land Trust (NALT). “The value of this open space,” Johnson said, “will be magnified over the coming decades and be remembered as a truly visionary act like the creation of Central Park or the conservation of the Presidio.”

Left unsaid was how Boeing stands to benefit. Within a month of donating the easement to NALT, Boeing told the state of California it no longer intended to make the property clean enough to live on. Because the easement prohibits building on the land, the company said, Boeing instead intended to make the property safe for light recreation, such as hiking. That lesser standard would leave the vast majority of chemical pollution in the ground and shave at least tens of millions and perhaps hundreds of millions of dollars off the company’s cleanup costs, according to a Reuters analysis of the proposed cleanup standards and soil sampling data. Four independent cleanup specialists vetted the analysis.

California rejected Boeing’s argument that the conservation easement warranted a lesser cleanup, but to avoid a lawsuit and further delays, the state reopened negotiations with the company anyway. Boeing has won a preliminary victory in getting the state to consider new cleanup scenarios, including some that take the easement into account. All of the new options would leave more pollution behind than the cleanup the state approved years ago, according to a Reuters review of the company’s latest agreement with the California Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC).

Boeing’s strategy angers Jen Connell, who lost her husband, Mike, in April to glioblastoma, an aggressive brain cancer. He lived most of his 50 years within five miles of Santa Susana’s rocket-testing platforms and blamed radioactive ash from there for his disease. Radiation is known to increase the risk of glioblastoma.

“What about preserving human life?” said the mother of two. “They got a smoke screen going on to make them look like they have a halo.”

Boeing, in a statement to Reuters, said it is “misleading” to say that it is using the conservation easement to limit cleanup at Santa Susana. Boeing noted it has agreed to clean up one type of contaminant – radioactive material – to levels present before the field lab existed. Though its agreement with California expresses Boeing’s preference to clean up other contaminants to the safe-for-recreation standard, the company also noted it has agreed to accept whatever cleanup the state chooses, including a stricter option that would make the site safe for homes and gardening. State officials told Reuters they intend to require this.

Still, state officials acknowledged that all the options outlined in the new Boeing agreement would clean up less soil than called for in the old one. In a written response to Reuters, they said the changes reflected the state’s use of “best available science.” Regulators will hold Boeing to the same health protections required previously, they wrote, and the easement will not influence their choice of a cleanup option.

‘Foolish’

The idea of using a conservation easement to lobby for a lesser cleanup of polluted land rankles James Florio, the former U.S. representative who authored the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980. Congress passed the act, commonly known as the Superfund law, to require companies to clean up their toxic messes. Easements shouldn’t be used as an excuse to leave pollution behind, Florio said.

“Saying you’re not going to clean it up because it’s not going to do any harm, because it’s not going to be used, is foolish,” he said.

Yet dozens of companies across the United States have benefited from the strategy. And the country’s top environmental watchdog, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, is encouraging conservation easements on polluted land as a way to make contaminated sites useful again.

Conservation easements on contaminated sites Because of decentralized record-keeping systems, no one knows how many conservation easements are on contaminated land. Reuters identified 40 mostly by scouring county land records and regulatory documents.

Reuters found conservation easements on at least 40 contaminated sites, including former landfills, mines, waste ponds and burn pits. Twenty-four of the locations are or have been in the federal Superfund program, which targets the nation’s most toxic waste sites.

In each case Reuters uncovered, the easement contract notes the land’s history of contamination. For at least 25 sites, Reuters found documents that acknowledge the safety of the cleanup relies in part on the conservation easement’s promise to prevent development or other activities on the land. In at least six cases, state or federal regulators cited the easement’s land restrictions as a reason to let polluters conduct lesser cleanups that left some contamination behind.

Meant to protect people from dangerous exposure to toxic substances, the easement arrangements rely on landowners, land trusts and developers to honor prohibitions on unsafe activity for as long as the danger remains. But Reuters found that these agreements and others like them are inconsistently enforced, lapses that can result in dire health consequences, legal and environmental scholars said.

Environmental monitoring reports show pollution is migrating from some of these contaminated sites and threatening neighboring communities. At others, contaminants endanger plants and animals. People have built homes, unwittingly or not, on or near properties that had restrictions similar to conservation easements, exposing them to contaminated water, toxic fumes and cancer causing chemicals.

The matchmaker

Some environmental regulators and cleanup consultants argue that easements can play an important role on polluted properties. Along with deed restrictions, zoning controls and other notices attached to land records, easements aim to ensure that people don’t build on contaminated land.

Nor is it always possible to fully decontaminate polluted land. The cost can be out of reach. It also can be technically impossible or impractical.

“I wish there were endless resources to clean everything up,” said Jim Kuipers, a consulting engineer who has worked on mine cleanups for decades. “The EPA’s charge is to protect human health and the environment. It’s not to restore to background or entirely pure conditions.”

Regulators have long supported easements as a warning flag for future generations. Reuters found some dating back as far as 1991.

But that was never their intended purpose, scholars say. “Plunking a conservation easement on a property in lieu of cleaning it up is a perversion of the use of a conservation easement,” said Nancy McLaughlin, a law professor at the University of Utah whose work focuses on the legal agreements.

Yet in recent years, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the regulatory body responsible for monitoring and approving cleanups of Superfund sites, has been encouraging companies to use easements to save time and reduce costs. The agency notes additional benefits: Preserving land can boost a company’s image as a friend of the environment, and some can claim tax deductions for donating their polluted land.

Easements can “provide win-win-win opportunities for everyone and in many cases, also vulnerable species,” the EPA told Reuters in a statement. The deals also can help companies “repair their relationship with the community.”

The agency held a webinar in January 2020 called “The Brilliant and Profitable Role of Conservation Easements in Superfund Site Redevelopment.”

“Never underestimate the value of a great story,” Bill Denman, then EPA acting national program manager for Superfund redevelopment, told participants. “The environment wins, the community wins, the developer wins.”

Denman has played matchmaker, looking to connect companies with land trusts willing to take easements on contaminated land. One ally is Kat West, a former EPA lawyer turned consultant who has called herself the “EPA whisperer.”

West was a featured speaker at the January 2020 webinar. She contacted EPA regulators that month via email, saying she had spoken with NALT – the land trust that holds the easement on Boeing’s Santa Susana property – about doing more work on contaminated sites. NALT was looking for new partners, she said.

“Steve Carter is the President and said we can send people directly to him,” West wrote.

West arranged a call with Carter and the EPA’s Denman. Soon, Denman provided Carter a new opportunity. In a February 2020 email, Denman introduced the NALT leader to a cleanup specialist from the multinational chemical company BASF to discuss a conservation easement on contaminated BASF land. The EPA told Reuters the conversation was meant to explore placing a conservation easement on the land to protect a bird habitat that had been created during a cleanup nine years earlier.

The EPA said the conservation idea never came to fruition. A BASF spokesperson said he was unaware of any ongoing discussions with NALT. West declined to comment.

Asked about the agency’s promotion of conservation easements, the EPA described the deals as tools to ensure the future safety of a site, not influencers of its cleanup decisions. The EPA said it encourages adding easements after a cleanup method is chosen, not before.

An opaque system

Conservation easements gained prominence after the U.S. Congress in 1980 created permanent tax breaks for them, to preserve “natural resources and cultural heritage.”

It is impossible to know how many companies have placed conservation easements on contaminated land. Also unknowable is whether companies have sought tax breaks for such easements in the name of land conservation. That’s because neither corporations nor nonprofits are required to disclose detailed information about the easements. The EPA and other regulators say they don’t keep count or any central record of them. Tax deductions and land appraisals are private, and the United States keeps no comprehensive records of property conservation.

Reuters identified most of the 40 easements on contaminated land by searching for mentions in environmental regulatory documents and by reviewing land records in hundreds of U.S. counties, where the easements are recorded along with property deeds. Beyond Boeing, major multinationals that have granted easements on polluted land directly or via subsidiaries include oil companies Chevron, BP, ExxonMobil and Citgo Petroleum, chemicals giant DuPont, aerospace contractor Lockheed Martin and drug maker AstraZeneca.

“Plunking a conservation easement on a property in lieu of cleaning it up is a perversion of the use of a conservation easement.”

Boeing and Chevron were among a handful of companies that said they did not seek tax deductions for their conservation easements. Citgo Petroleum confirmed it took a tax deduction but declined to disclose the amount. The others either declined to comment, didn’t respond to inquiries or said they didn’t know if they took a deduction. Reuters found 13 companies with easement contracts that refer to the section of the Internal Revenue Service code that allows for conservation-easement tax deductions, leaving the door open to claim them.

Even without claiming tax breaks, companies can realize significant financial savings by leveraging the easements in cleanup negotiations with regulators.

Companies save money because in choosing a cleanup plan, regulators consider how people might use the property in the future and what health risks the contaminants pose. The most expensive cleanups restore property to a pristine condition or make it safe enough for people to live there, drink the groundwater and eat food grown in home gardens. Less cleanup is required if the land is to be used for hiking or other recreation. Even less is necessary if a conservation easement allows little to no use of the property.

The savings can easily total tens of millions of dollars, said engineer Kuipers, who has consulted on dozens of cleanups and testified in court cases as an expert on cost estimates. For the largest and most contaminated sites, like Boeing’s, he said, companies could save hundreds of millions of dollars.

EPA records show Chevron saved an estimated $45 million when the EPA approved a less costly cleanup for a Questa, New Mexico, site where Chevron once mined molybdenum, a metal used mainly in the construction and energy sectors. The agency cited a 2009 conservation easement as a reason to allow the company to make part of the site clean enough for industrial use rather than requiring it to make the land safe for housing.

The choice left 25 times more cancer-causing polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in the ground than the most stringent cleanup would have allowed, EPA records show. The records also show that molybdenum, which had been found at levels 75 times higher than is safe for housing, was not required to be cleaned up at all in that section. Chevron provides bottled water to employees of a local fishery because the metal – harmful to people and wildlife in high doses – has been found in tap water there, according to a 2018 state and federal report about the site. A fishery employee confirmed that the company is still providing water today.

In an emailed response to questions, Chevron said the conservation easement supports the cleanup goals for the property. It said that the land is too steep for home construction and that the company is doing everything the EPA requires in its cleanup.

Boeing declined to answer questions about how much it stands to save if California allows it to scale back the cleanup at Santa Susana. State regulators said they have not yet estimated the costs of the various scenarios. “Based on similar cleanups, we expect the costs of cleaning up the Boeing areas of responsibility to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars,” the regulators said.

A Reuters analysis of the state’s various cleanup standards shows Boeing’s cleanup could allow some chemicals to remain at levels tens, hundreds, and even thousands of times higher than previously promised.

Officials from the DTSC objected to the news agency’s focus on the amount of pollution the cleanup would leave behind. What matters, they said, are the health standards driving the cleanup requirements. Those standards focus on minimizing the risk of cancer or other health issues.

State officials said they still intend to require Boeing to make the land safe enough to live on, even though the law requires them to consider other scenarios, some of which require less cleanup.

“DTSC has fought fervently for a clear path toward this high standard and will continue to do so until the cleanup is complete,” they said in an emailed response.

Yet at Boeing’s behest, the state has changed the way it calculates safety standards at Santa Susana.

A Boeing contractor urged DTSC officials to reexamine the formula that determines which parts of Santa Susana need to be cleaned up, state emails show. DTSC officials said they agreed because their previous calculations did not reflect the “best science.” Under the state’s revised formula, even the strictest cleanup DTSC is considering – one that allows homes on the property – would leave far more pollution behind.

Corporations and their partners who support the use of conservation easements say that even if some contaminants remain, the open land still provides viable wildlife habitat and green space for people to enjoy. If the land were fully cleaned up, some argue, those benefits would be lost because companies would sell the land to developers to recoup some of their cleanup costs.

If remaining contamination is properly managed, cleanup specialists said, sites can be used safely as parks, soccer fields, parking lots and more. Easements and other land-use restrictions can help conserve land worth preserving and protect people from the hazards that remain.

Some environmental scientists say the benefits to wildlife and the environment are often overstated.

Take Santa Susana. Boeing has said that the land preservation plan has “secured Santa Susana’s bright future as open space habitat.” The site is home to endangered plants and more than 150 types of animals.

Some of the cleanup options the state is considering would leave wildlife vulnerable to cancers and reproductive issues for decades, if not centuries, to come, said Frank von Hippel, a professor of environmental health sciences at the University of Arizona who reviewed the primary Santa Susana cleanup scenarios. Studies have linked many of the site’s contaminants to animal tumors, cancers, and reproductive and immune dysfunction.

“If the property is not safe for people, then it certainly is not safe for much of the wildlife,” von Hippel said.

State regulators said they would use Boeing’s ecological risk assessments in evaluating the impacts on wildlife.

“The assertion that the cleanup will ‘leave wildlife vulnerable’ is incorrect,” the regulators said in their response.

The use of conservation easements as protection for people isn’t foolproof, either. The limits recorded in conservation easements, deed restrictions and other controls linked to property records can get lost with the passage of time. And history shows that can have devastating health consequences.

It was this very kind of public health disaster that spurred Congress to create the Superfund program in 1980 to require cleanup of the nation’s most polluted lands. Congress was responding to a national outcry over children and adults sickened by pollution in the Love Canal neighborhood of Niagara Falls, New York.

The owner of a former chemical plant had sold to the Niagara Falls Board of Education – for a cost of $1 – land that the company had used as a dumping ground for more than 21,000 tons of toxic waste. Attached to the 1953 sale documents – and publicly filed at the Niagara County clerk’s office – was a warning that the land contained dangerous chemicals and that the buyers assumed all liability, including risk of death. Though different from a conservation easement, the notice had the same intent: to warn people about the property’s limitations.

Just a year later, the Board of Education, needing classrooms for a growing community, built an elementary school on the property. For more than 20 years, children splashed in contaminated puddles and played over leaking waste drums buried just beneath the surface. Several children required medical treatment for chemical burns on their faces.

After chemicals seeped into neighboring homes, the state declared a public health emergency in 1978. Pregnant women and children under age 2 were told to evacuate. The school was closed, at least 80 chemicals were identified at the site, and residents of the Love Canal neighborhood were instructed to stay out of their basements. More than 700 homes would eventually be razed.

Reuters found other examples of failed protections.

They included an abandoned battery recycling plant in Hamburg, Pennsylvania, where the EPA found chickens and cows grazing on contaminated land and drinking lead-contaminated water in 2012 in violation of a conservation easement. Lead contamination can transfer from cows and chickens to people who consume their dairy products. Reuters was unable to determine whether that occurred here.

In Newark, New Jersey, Ronson Metals Corp closed a decades-old factory that had made cigarette lighters. The company, with state permission, left hazardous chemicals – including trichloroethylene, which can cause neurological damage and has been linked to cancer – in the soil, covering the site with clay and crushed stone. It filed a deed restriction in 2002, limiting the land’s use to non-residential purposes such as parking. Despite this, developers built 19 homes and five businesses on the land in the 2000s. After the state learned of the situation in 2012, it installed pumps to vent toxic fumes from residents’ basements.

Conservation easements, in theory, carry more protection than the simple notice filed in the case of Love Canal. They require some entity – such as a government agency or a land trust – to accept responsibility for enforcement.

“Put quite simply, our goal is to leave places better than we found them.”

The Land Trust Alliance, the primary association of land trusts, publishes best practices for land trusts overseeing conservation easements. They call for visiting the land at least once every five years. In intervening years, annual checks can be done from the air. In the event a land trust disbands, it should take “reasonable steps” to transfer conservation easements to other stewards.

NALT, the land trust that accepted Boeing’s controversial easement, left the voluntary alliance because it disagreed with a 2019 policy change requiring member land trusts to review donors’ tax appraisals, said Carter, NALT’s president. NALT believed that policy conflicted with IRS guidance, he said.

NALT’s holdings of more than 500 easements include others that have stirred controversy, including one on property owned by former President Donald Trump. That property is the subject of a tax fraud investigation by the New York attorney general. Trump denies wrongdoing and calls the probe a politically motivated witch hunt.

Since 2006, at least nine IRS disputes over NALT easements have ended up in U.S. Tax Court. The cases include some on golf courses with conditions that the IRS says run counter to conservation, such as strong chemicals used to maintain the greens and a border collie trained to chase away wildlife. The IRS also opened an audit of an investment group’s 2018 tax return that included a $220 million deduction facilitated by NALT. The deduction relied on a practice lawmakers have labeled an “abusive tax shelter” that uses overinflated land valuations. Asked about the status of the case, the IRS said it could not comment on “pending litigation.” NALT declined to comment.

Carter said the trust does not shy away from “messy” projects that fit its conservation mission.

NALT and Boeing declined to disclose the full terms of their deal. Carter said Boeing paid NALT a “pretty hefty” sum to monitor the Santa Susana site in perpetuity. Neither he nor Boeing would reveal the amount.

Asked what the monitoring would entail, Carter said NALT intends to visit the property at least once a year and will use drones and satellite imagery to help enforce the easement. Carter emphasized that NALT is not responsible for monitoring any remaining pollution and assumed no liability for the contamination.

Since granting the easement to NALT, Boeing has been promoting the deal on its website and in company reports as an example of its commitment to environmental stewardship.

In 2021, at a ceremony sponsored by Boeing, the Wildlife Habitat Council gave the company an award for its efforts to preserve the Santa Susana site. The nonprofit council, created by industry to promote corporate conservation, also listed Boeing as the sponsor of a 2017 white paper on corporate conservation, in which the company’s director of environment, health and safety wrote: “In our pursuit of global environmental leadership, we champion the value of going above and beyond compliance. Our robust remediation and restoration program exemplifies this approach. Put quite simply, our goal is to leave places better than we found them.”

Margaret O'Gorman, president of the Wildlife Habitat Council, declined to comment on the dispute over the Santa Susana cleanup, but called the site “an incredible asset for nature as one of the last open spaces in the Simi Valley.” A spokesman for the council said its awards are based on scores determined by third-party reviewers.

Melissa Bumstead has been speaking out against such claims since learning about the Santa Susana pollution seven years ago.

The mother of two says she still regrets moving her family in 2012 to West Hills, less than five miles southeast of the Boeing site. Two years after they settled there, her daughter, Grace, was diagnosed with a rare form of leukemia at age 4.

Grace has spent much of her childhood in hospitals. With a weakened immune system, playgrounds, dance classes and even eating fresh strawberries proved too dangerous for her to enjoy. Two girls she befriended in treatment have since died.

After a relapse and bone marrow transplant in 2017, Grace, now 12, is in remission but must take growth hormone shots daily until she’s 16 to counter side effects of treatments she’s endured.

“I struggle with this now even though I know it’s not my fault,” Bumstead said. Grace’s cancer is considered “one in a million,” but there has been at least one other child diagnosed with the same rare cancer less than five miles from Santa Susana since Grace got sick, Bumstead said.

In 2005, Boeing paid $30 million to settle neighbors’ claims that contamination from Santa Susana caused cancers and other illnesses, according to a plaintiff in the case. Boeing declined to comment on the settlement.

The 1959 nuclear reactor accident at the site may have caused hundreds, if not thousands, of cancer cases in neighboring communities, an advisory panel of scientists and other stakeholders concluded in a 2006 government-commissioned report.

A separate 2007 government-funded study found the area had an unusually high rate of thyroid cancers, and noted evidence that thyroid-disrupting contaminants from the lab had leaked into off-site groundwater. The scientists said there were too few cases to draw any conclusions about childhood cancers.

No government-sponsored research has been done since 2007, but activists say they have documented at least 81 children with cancer within 20 miles of the Boeing site. The cases include leukemia, rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma and aggressive and fatal brain cancers.

In response to questions, Boeing sent Reuters links to studies, reports, memos and a professor's slideshow that had mixed conclusions. Some did not find unusual cancer rates, while others found elevated rates only in some types of cancers.

Bumstead, who founded Parents Against Santa Susana Field Lab in 2017, said she sees Boeing’s conservation easement as the latest in a long line of greenwashing tactics to avoid cleanup. Though none of the cleanup scenarios the state is considering would require a complete cleanup of the site, her grassroots group is determined to keep pressing for that outcome.

Jen Connell joined Bumstead’s efforts and began tracking brain cancers in the area after her husband, Mike, was diagnosed in September 2020 at age 48 with glioblastoma, a rare and aggressive brain cancer linked to radiation exposure. Activists have documented at least 20 cases of the cancer within 20 miles of the former field lab. Half were diagnosed after the 2018 Woolsey fire that started at Santa Susana. Reuters reviewed fundraising posts, statements from relatives, and obituaries for some of the cases.

The couple was married for 20 years with two teenage sons. Mike lived all but two years of his life less than five miles downhill from the Santa Susana Field Lab. The other two were spent living near another toxic waste site.

Mike believed the 2018 wildfire stirred up radiation that caused his cancer. In his last Facebook post, five months before his death, he reflected on living in the shadow of Santa Susana and recalled playing near the field lab as a kid.

“We used to hear the rocket test motors daily,” he said. “Those Rocketdyne hills have always been a hot spot over the years and now … the 2018 fires have spread all this existing mess across Simi Valley.”

He passed away in his wife’s arms on April 6th, after 19 months and three surgeries fighting cancer.",How Boeing created a nature preserve that may also preserve pollution

The air carrier ordered 100 new Dreamliners with options to add 100 more in the future, as well as ordering up to 100 Boeing 737 Max aircraft.

“With this investment in its future fleet, the 737 Max and 787 will help United accelerate its fleet modernization and global growth strategy,” said Stan Deal, president and CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes.

Part of the fleet modernization includes the pursuit of reducing the air carrier’s carbon emissions

United intends to replace its older Boeing 767s and 777s with about 100 of the new widebody aircraft, with all 767 aircraft removed from its fleet by 2030. Culling the older aircraft is projected to decrease per-seat carbon emissions by 25 percent, the airline said.

United has set the goal of reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 100 percent by 2050, without relying on traditional carbon offsets. It’s not alone in setting ambitious environmental goals. Earlier this year, Boeing said it intends for its commercial airplane fleet to be certified to fly on 100 percent SAF by 2030.

Boeing has also worked to reduce the noise footprint for the 787, reducing the sound of the jet by as much as 60 percent over that of the jets it is replacing.

The manufacturer also noted the 737 Max is designed for improved fuel efficiency in the single-aisle market, as the 737 Max reduces fuel use and CO2 emissions by 20 percent compared to the airplanes it replaces, depending on the configuration.

Looking Ahead: More Pilots

The expansion of United’s fleet means, however, it will need to hire more pilots. The airline reports hiring 2,400 pilots in 2022, with plans to add more than 2,500 pilots in 2023 with an ultimate goal of hiring 10,000 new pilots by the end of the decade. In order to do this, United opened the United Aviate Academy, which company officials predict will train some 5,000 new pilots by 2030.

“This order solves for our current widebody replacement needs in a more fuel-efficient and cost-efficient way, while also giving our customers a best-in-class experience,” said Gerry Laderman, United’s EVP and chief financial officer. “And if the future of long-haul flying is as bright as we think it will be, United is able to capitalize on those opportunities by exercising these new widebody options—I look forward to the incremental margin and earnings these aircraft will generate.”",United’s Big Boeing Purchase Set to Advance Its Ambitious Climate Goals

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Long-haul carrier Emirates successfully flew a Boeing 777 on a test flight Monday with one of its two engines entirely powered by so-called sustainable aviation fuel. This comes as carriers worldwide try to lessen their carbon footprint.

Flight 2646 flew for just under an hour over the coastline of the United Arab Emirates, after taking off from Dubai International Airport, the world’s busiest for international travel, and heading out into the Persian Gulf before circling to land. The second of the plane’s General Electric Co. engines ran on conventional jet fuel for safety.

“This flight is a milestone moment for Emirates and a positive step for our industry as we work collectively to address one of our biggest challenges — reducing our carbon footprint,” Adel al-Redha, Emirates’ chief operation officer, said in a statement.

Emirates, a state-owned airline under Dubai’s ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, described the sustainable fuel as a blend “that mirrored the qualities of jet fuel.” It included fuel from Neste, a Finnish firm, and Virent, a Madison, Wisconsin-based company.

Virent describes itself as using plant-based sugars to make the compounds needed for sustainable jet fuel, while Neste’s fuel comes from vegetable oils and animal fats. Those fuels reduce the release of heat-trapping carbon dioxide typically burned off by engines in flight.

Aviation releases only one-sixth the amount of carbon dioxide produced by cars and trucks, according to World Resources Institute, a nonprofit research group based in Washington. However, airplanes are used by far fewer people per day — meaning aviation is a higher per-capita source of greenhouse-gas emissions.

Airplane and engine manufacturers have been designing more-efficient models, in part to help keep down costs of jet fuel — one of the biggest expenses airlines face. Emirates, for instance, used over 5.7 million tons of jet fuel last year alone, costing it $3.7 billion out of its $17 billion in annual expenses.

But analysts suggest sustainable fuels can be three times or more the cost of jet fuel, likely putting ticket prices even higher as aviation restarts following the lockdowns during the coronavirus pandemic.

It wasn’t immediately clear how much the fuel used in the Emirates’ test on Monday cost per barrel. Jet fuel cost on average $146 a barrel at the end of last week, according to S&P Global Platts.

The UAE, a major oil producer and OPEC member, is to host the next United Nations climate negotiations, or COP28, beginning in November. Already, the seven sheikhdom federation has been criticized for nominating the CEO of Abu Dhabi’s state oil company to lead the U.N. negotiations known as the Conference of the Parties — where COP gets its name.

In this article, we’ll explore Boeing’s new research initiative and how the company plans to address sustainability in the aviation sector

The transportation industry accounts for 27% of annual greenhouse gas emissions, making it the biggest contributor to carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions worldwide.

The impacts of CO2 are detrimental and far-reaching. From increasing global temperatures to more acidic oceans, carbon dioxide endangers the livelihood of plants, animals, and humans around the world. As the planet heats up, natural disasters such as flooding, famine, drought, and hurricanes increase in intensity and frequency.

Although aviation’s contribution to climate change only amounts to 2.5% of global CO2 emissions, planes are extremely difficult to decarbonize meaning left unchecked, the emissions from aviation will have a compound effect on global warming. In light of this, aviation conglomerate Boeing announced it has plans to open a new Japanese-based sustainability research center and further expand its existing sustainability partnerships.

In this article, we’ll dive into Boeing’s new initiative and how the company plans to address sustainability in the aviation sector.

An Overview: Boeing and Its New Research Center

The future is green, and Boeing is hopping on board. The company aims to have all commercial flights run on sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) by 2030. To aid in this quest and drive sustainable initiatives in the aviation industry, the company recently announced its plans to open a new research center to focus on SAF, hydrogen propulsion, robotics, digitization, and composites.

These new initiatives will help Boeing plan for and future-proof operations. This comes at a crucial time because the industry is actively recovering from economic losses stemming from COVID-19, while also shifting to more sustainable business practices with long-term environmental and financial benefits.

By investing in its new research center, Boeing will be able to boost its research and innovation strategies. This should have a positive effect on Boeing’s revenue, and result in rising profits.

A Glance into the Future of Sustainable Aviation

As opposed to using traditional jet fuel, which is a known environmental pollutant, Boeing’s new center will focus on SAF. SAF uses renewable feedstocks such as cooking oil and animal fat as fuel, which makes it a healthy alternative to traditional fuel. What’s more, it provides an 80% reduction in CO2 emissions compared to regular jet fuel.

As the graph below shows, the global SAF market size is forecasted to grow rapidly. By 2026, it’s expected to reach $6.65 billion.

Unsurprisingly, Boeing is also researching electric and hybrid planes. This is part of a growing interest in the aviation industry, as investments in battery-powered and hybrid planes have been steadily increasing for the past five years.

In the years to come, we expect to see the market increase in valuation as additional venture capital investments roll in, and research continues. In fact, the first commercial-ready electric planes are expected to launch in 2026, with early adopters United and EasyJet leading the charge.

Closing Words: The Aviation Industry is Flying Towards a Sustainable Future

Boeing’s new research center, coupled with other electric aviation industry leaders, is likely to pave the way for the future of aviation. In conjunction with the climate crisis, we expect to see more aviation company’s implementing and adhering to sustainable practices.

During the newsmakers breakfast Q&A session with analyst Richard Aboulafia on Monday at NBAA-BACE 2002 on Monday, Marc Allen, the U.S. aerospace group’s chief strategy officer, made it clear it will not be following its European rival Airbus in looking to bring hydrogen-powered, medium-range narrowbody airliners into service by the mid-2030s.

“We have shifted our language from zero emissions to zero impact [on the environment],” Allen commented. “Hydrogen might have a role, but that might be being used on the ground to produce SAF or perhaps for direct propulsion. But how can we be sure it’s truly green hydrogen and that the net result might not be worse in terms of emissions, not just CO2 but also contrails.”

Boeing is using a data modeling tool called Cascade to assess which technologies would produce the greatest benefit in terms of reducing the environmental impact of flying. “It allows you to put in all your assumptions about the future and when you see what will really move the needle you get right into changes like continuous descents [instead of step-down approaches], fleet renewal, and SAF,” he explained.

The airframer has a strong vested interest in airlines replacing older aircraft, but it is also making significant investments in building the ecosystem needed for widespread SAF use and achieving a step change in the efficiency of air traffic management to avoid fuel being consumed inefficiently.

Acknowledging that Europe’s aerospace sector has benefitted from large amounts of government support for moon-shot long-term research and development work, like the push for hydrogen propulsion, the Boeing executive questioned whether this approach will reap meaningful returns. “As long as we keep coming back to what customers actually want and driving value in everything we do, we can leave it to others to waste a lot of money on innovation,” he concluded.

Another path Boeing will not be taking is the one leading to supersonic flight, with Allen indicating the company has no regrets about withdrawing support for Aerion last year in a move that effectively marked the end of the start-up. “The art of strategy is choosing what not to do and our decision speaks for itself,” he said. “What we haven’t been able to do is to pin down what are the critical things you must believe [to bring supersonic aircraft to market] and we need a better theory of this.”

Allen added that the recent type certification of China’s Comac C919 airliner was a welcome disruption to the entrenched Boeing/Airbus market domination. “A duopoly is hard because every campaign feels strategic and every loss seems existential,” he reflected.

At the same time, Boeing now has an interesting side bet on the autonomous eVTOL aircraft its Wisk Aero joint venture with Kitty Hawk is working on. Allen predicted that autonomous flight will start with small aircraft like Wisk’s planned four-seater with its 90-mile range, but this won’t become a reality until the end of the 2020s.

“Technology innovation doesn’t stop, and now that aviation is an adult industry where the change looks different [from younger industries] there is no reason to think that innovation won’t continue to disrupt us,” he concluded. “We start with digital, sustainable, and autonomous as our innovation pillars and these run through everything we do and how we do it.”",Boeing Pushes Zero-impact over Zero Emissions

Although Airbus also advocates for the increased availability of SAF, the European company sees a more prominent role for hydrogen in the nearer term and plans to introduce a hydrogen-powered narrowbody airliner by 2035.

The extent to which the U.S. company’s view on hydrogen contrasts with that of Airbus went on display during a series of media briefings in Seattle in mid-June, as Boeing chief sustainability officer Chris Raymond called for the need to understand the “realities” and relative benefits of various alternative fuel types, including hydrogen and electric.

Reflecting on his company’s considerable experience with fuel cells and cryogenic hydrogen production over the past decade and a half, Raymond didn’t reject those avenues’ potential but cautioned that their large-scale application will require far more development time than some would suggest. He cited Boeing’s own studies on hydrogen power—including the world’s first piloted hydrogen fuel cell-powered aircraft in 2008 and an airplane powered by liquid-hydrogen combustion engine in 2012—as if to underscore the company’s knowledge of its limitations and challenges.

Raymond also cited early lessons learned from studies Boeing and NASA recently completed on a 37,000-gallon carbon-fiber hydrogen fuel tank. “If you convert that to equivalent energy for jet fuel, it's about 3,700 gallons of jet fuel, which is about what powers a regional jet, but the cross-section of [the tank] is about the size of a regional jet,” he explained, highlighting the scale challenges liquid hydrogen presents for application on an aircraft.

“And by the way, the white stuff that you see on there is called frost,” he added, referring to a photograph in his Powerpoint presentation. “So how are we going to deal with that at 30,000 feet? And how are we going to deal with the water that we create with hydrogen fuel cells at 30,000 feet, especially contrails, which are all coming into our vocabulary now as a component of carbon emission? We have to understand how to deal with contrail formation on a hydrogen fuel cell airplane. And we're studying that.”

Raymond also cited the lifecycle challenges associated with hydrogen production, which with the technology now available generates its own greenhouse gasses. Large-scale production of so-called green hydrogen with techniques such as electrolysis and steam methane reforming will take many years and involve an evolutionary, rather than revolutionary, process.

“A lot of it is what you believe about how fast the grids are going to change to renewable electricity,” said Raymond. “I don't believe we're going to just sort of get to this Nirvana state eventually. I think there'll be a migration over the years. And I actually think as we start to introduce things like industrial carbon capture, you can make some of the fuel pathways cleaner…and people are starting to do that now.”

More immediately and even for the near future, though, Boeing has turned its focus to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) as the most promising avenue for reducing greenhouse gasses, particularly given the volume of fuel burned on long-distance flights. Raymond noted that 50 percent of all flights don’t exceed 1,000 kilometers but they account for only 15 percent of all the fuel used. Meanwhile, roughly 10 percent of all flights extend beyond 2,800 kilometers but they account for half of all the fuel burned. Given that even Airbus acknowledges that hydrogen-powered widebodies won’t become feasible for several years after the first narrowbody propelled by hydrogen reaches the market, the role of SAF as a primary emissions reduction measure will extend far beyond 2035, argues Boeing.

Pledging to ensure all its commercial airplanes can fly on and gain certification to use 100 percent sustainable aviation fuels by 2030, Boeing points to its partnerships with airlines, industry, governments, and research institutions to expand limited SAF supplies and reduce the fuels' cost as evidence of its environmental credentials. The airframer worked with airlines, engine manufacturers, and others to conduct biofuel test flights starting in 2008 and gain approval for sustainable fuels in 2011. In 2018, the Boeing ecoDemonstrator flight-test program made the world's first commercial airplane flight using 100 percent sustainable fuels with a 777 Freighter in collaboration with FedEx Express. Its most recent ecoDemonstrator, a former Singapore Airlines 777-200ER unveiled on June 16, will also test the effects of SAF on emissions reduction along with about another 30 sustainability and safety-related technologies.

Although he didn’t dismiss the potential for hydrogen to serve as one avenue for reaching the industry’s net-zero emissions goals, Raymond clearly sees SAF as the most important way forward, at least for now.

“We have put a lot of our voice on sustainable aviation fuel as one of the forms of that renewable energy,” he said. “There's a lot of room to run in sustainable aviation fuel. There's room to scale up the production of it. And there's also room to scale up the innovation around it. And the fuels we all have in our heads as sustainable aviation fuels today are going to change. There are going to be new feedstocks. We're going to introduce carbon capture into the process. Hydrogen's going to get greener as a component of the process.”",Boeing Preaches Pragmatism in Setting Sustainability Priorities

Feb 15 (Reuters) - Boeing Co (BA.N) will more than double its purchases of blended sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) this year to 5.6 million gallons (21.2 million liters) to support its U.S. commercial operations, the planemaker said on Wednesday.

The fuel will be supplied by Neste, the world's largest SAF producer, Boeing said.

""This SAF procurement makes up 25% of Boeing's total jet fuel needs for last year ... ,"" Sheila Remes, the company's vice president of environmental sustainability, said in a statement.

The aviation sector has faced pressure from environmental groups to curb its emissions.

Boeing’s BA, +1.42% stock was down 0.68% before market open. The aircraft maker’s stock ended Tuesday’s session up 3.24%, outpacing the S&P 500 Index’s SPX, -0.14% gain of 1.63%.

Boeing reported a $5.49 loss per share, compared with a loss of 19 cents a share in the same period last year. Analysts surveyed by FactSet were looking for earnings of 13 cents a share. The company’s core loss per share, which excludes a FAS/CAS service cost adjustment, was $6.18. In its earnings release Boeing said that the/CAS service cost adjustment represents the difference between the Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) pension and postretirement service costs calculated under GAAP and costs allocated to the business segments.

The company’s third-quarter revenue was $15.956 billion, compared with $15.278 billion in the year-ago quarter. Analysts surveyed by FactSet were looking for sales of $17.911 billion.

Revenue and earnings were significantly impacted by losses on Boeing’s fixed-price defense development programs, according to the company’s CEO Dave Calhoun. “We’re squarely focused on maturing these programs, mitigating risks and delivering for our customers and their important missions,” he said, in a statement. “We remain in a challenging environment and have more work ahead to drive stability, improve our performance and ensure we’re consistently delivering on our commitments.”

The company’s Defense, Space, and Security revenue was $5.307 billion, compared with $6.617 billion in the same period last year. Defense, Space and Security operating margin was impacted by $2.8 billion of losses on certain fixed-price development programs. Boeing said this was driven by higher estimated manufacturing and supply chain costs, as well as technical challenges.

Commercial Airplanes revenue increased to $6.263 billion, compared with $4,459 in the same period last year, boosted by the resumption of 787 deliveries and higher 737 deliveries.

Boeing generated operating cash flow of $3.19 billion during the quarter. “We continue to make important strides in our turnaround and remain focused on our performance,” said Calhoun. “We generated strong cash in the quarter and are on a solid path to achieving positive free cash flow for 2022.”

As the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission begins its survey of the Earth’s surface this month, the satellite will get power from solar cells built by Spectrolab, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Boeing [NYSE: BA].

The SWOT satellite, targeted to launch this month from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California, will conduct the first global survey of water on the Earth’s surface, observe the fine details of the ocean’s surface topography, and measure how water bodies change over time.

The spacecraft will be powered by a six-panel solar array, containing a total of 3,360 of Spectrolab’s NeXt Triple Junction (XTJ) solar cells. These advanced cells pull power from multiple wavelengths, allowing higher efficiencies not possible with commercially available silicon solar cell technology.

“Our Spectrolab team knows our efforts to power space programs improve life on Earth. Learning more about our changing planet is key to that mission,” said Tony Mueller, president of Spectrolab. “We’re excited Spectrolab solar cells will be powering the first spacecraft to survey nearly all water on the Earth’s surface.”

From a unique non-sun-synchronous orbit, SWOT’s instruments will measure the height of water in the planet’s lakes, rivers, reservoirs and oceans in higher definition than ever before. The data will help NASA and its partners at the Centre National D’Etudes Spatiales (CNES), the Canadian Space Agency and U.K. Space Agency, inform water equity and water management decisions, provide new insights into Earth’s water and energy cycle, and help to prepare communities for rising seas and changing coastlines in a warming climate.

The SWOT mission will be managed by NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which provided the science payload and its instruments. Spectrolab’s solar cell work was done for Thales Alenia Space, which was contracted by CNES to manufacture the satellite bus and conduct the final assembly, integration and test.

Spectrolab has produced more than 6.5 million gallium-arsenide solar cells for more than 1,000 spacecraft over the last 65 years in a shared vision with customers to connect and protect people globally, enable the exploration of other worlds, and build a space ecosystem for the future.

The initiative is a part of a newly expanded cooperation agreement with Meti. In 2019, the two entities signed an agreement to strengthen innovative aircraft technologies, including advanced batteries, motors and controllers.

Greg Hyslop, Boeing’s chief engineer, said in the statement: “Working with terrific partners like METI, the new centre will expand upon Boeing-wide initiatives in sustainable fuels and electrification and explore the intersection of digitisation, automation and high-performance aerospace composites for greater sustainability in our future products and production systems.”

The new facility will be located in Nagoya, where many of Boeing’s industrial partners and suppliers are based. It will expand the company’s R&D footprint in Asia, which currently includes facilities in Australia, China and South Korea. The company currently has 11 R&D centres globally.

Additionally, Boeing said that it has become a partner in Act For Sky, a voluntary organisation founded by 16 Japanese companies in March 2022, which works to commercialise and expand the use of SAF in Japan.

SAF is a cleaner alternative to conventional fossil jet fuel produced with sustainable feedstocks including cooking oil and solid waste from homes and businesses. SAF can reduce aeroplane carbon emissions by up to 80%, according to the International Air Transport Association, and has attracted significant recent investments this year.

In June, Australian flagship air carrier Qantas and Boeing’s European rival Airbus announced plans to partner and invest up to $200m to fast track the establishment of a SAF industry in Australia.

Meanwhile, Boeing has signed sustainability agreements with All Nippon Airways (ANA) and Japan Airlines (JAL), which both use Boeing aircrafts as part of their fleets. The companies will work together on research into advanced sustainable technologies, including electric, hybrid, hydrogen and other propulsion systems.

Boeing has previously collaborated with the two Japanese airlines on SAF-powered flights. In February 2021, JAL operated a commercial flight using jet fuel blended with SAF between Fukuoka and Tokyo Haneda airports.

JAL and ANA are both members of the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Users Group, which includes 25 member airlines as well as Boeing and Airbus.

One such risk involved while flying a plane is a weather phenomenon known as crosswinds. A Crosswind is a type of wind that dissects the runway, hitting the plane at a 90 degree angle, hence disturbing its flight path. Unlike turbulence, the crosswind occurs while taking off or landing the plane, near the runway. Also, with the speed of the plane much lower than the cruising altitude, the impact of crosswind (Depending on its intensity) can be pretty severe.

Those who know aviation, or fly frequently, know how dangerous crosswind can be for a flight, attempting to land on a runway. However, there's again a difference between a plane landing or taking off, while suffering a heavy crosswind. Innumerous videos have captured failed attempt by pilots to land a plane amidst crosswind. However, in the worst of the case, the pilot makes a go around, waits for the wind to settle, and lands the plane.

Things, though, becomes quite difficult while a plane taking off from an airport suffers a crosswind. One such incident was recorded on camera and has been shared widely on social media platforms. As seen in a video, a Boeing 737 of Europe's low cost airline Ryanair, takes off the runway, and suffers massive crosswind force, altering the angle of the plane.

While it might be a jittery moment for the passengers, such crosswind navigations are a nail biting experience for plane spotters as well. The Ryanair pilot was skilled enough to tackle such a situation and cautiously takes off the plane without any untoward incident.

One can see the plane tilting almost 45 degrees, and then straightening again to negate the force of the crosswind. Having said that, not everyone can take off or land a plane in such conditions. Strong crosswinds often test pilot’s capabilities and can be a major cause of concern for a plane’s safety.

Recently a video of a British Airways plane went viral where a pilot was forced to abort a landing at the Heathrow airport due to strong crosswind moments before touching down on the runway.",Watch: Brave Ryanair Pilot Skillfully Navigates Boeing 737 Amidst Severe Crosswind

The wings for the final 747-8 freighter, line number LN 1574, were loaded on the line almost 54 years after the final body join of the first aircraft in the summer of 1968 and comes 54 years and 8 months after the initial wing skin/stringer riveting machine began work on the first units at Everett in September 1967.

All four of the final aircraft are due for delivery to cargo carrier Atlas Air by the end of 2022, Boeing says. The first of the group, which were ordered by Atlas in January 2021, is LN 1571, which made its first flight on April 22 and is expected to deliver soon having made its fourth shake-down flight on May 17.

The second aircraft, LN1572, is undergoing final body join on the production line in Everett’s Building 40-22. The wing set for LN1573 is meanwhile being prepared for mating with the center fuselage section prior to transfer to the final body join position. Systems installation for the forward and aft fuselage sections of the second-to-last 747-8 is meanwhile underway in the adjacent build-up area on the north-west side of 40-22.

Boeing confirmed in 2020 it would terminate production of the 747 in 2022. Previously, the company had hoped to extend deliveries into 2023 but was forced to bring the production date cut off forward after the backlog shrank following order losses after financial problems at the Volga-Dnepr Group in Russia.

With the end of 747 production Boeing is preparing to bolster spares provisioning for the in-service fleet through Boeing Global Services, as well as clearing out space in 40-22 and the adjacent wing build-up area in 40-21. Following the consolidation of the 767/KC-46A and 747 line functions in 2016, and the transition of the 787 to Charleston, South Carolina, in 2021, the clearance of the 747 line will open up even more spare capacity in Everett. Boeing says no decisions have yet been taken on what to do with the space.

To-date Boeing has produced 1,569 747s of which the bulk—694—were 747-400s. The last variant of this model, a -400F, was delivered in December 2009.

The idea of upcycling planes is not new, and we’re not trying to make it sound like it is. It’s been around for decades and has been showcased brilliantly in a series of examples we’ve also covered over the years.Upcycling a decommissioned passenger aircraft by turning it into a residence, either a permanent home or a unique hotel , is costly and very time-consuming and requires a particular set of skills most DIY-ers don’t have. This is all the more true when we’re talking about an aircraft the size of a Boeing 727, which, when still airworthy, offers 1,200 square feet (111.5 square meters) of interior space for as many as 189 passengers. No wonder aircraft conversions never picked up speed to become mainstream.But DIY (Do It Yourself) homes made from airplanes do exist, and they stand out as beautiful exceptions. This one, the Boeing 727 home on a pole, would have made aircraft conversions standard without the need for laborious and expensive DIY. Dubbed the fastest house in the housing industry, it was the creation of former pilot Thomas Bennington and his Smyrna, Tennessee-based company Max Power Aerospace.Bennington’s idea was meant to solve several issues at once: that of sending perfectly good aircraft to the scrapyard, that of providing homes for people in areas prone to hurricanes and floods, and that of offering affordable housing. It was, as they say, perfection personified. A most beautiful Boeing 727-shaped unicorn that spun in the wind.Bennington applied for a patent for the Wind Resistant Dwelling in 1998, the same year he founded the company Max Power Aero. The patent was granted the following year, and for the next couple of years, he rode the wave of national fame , with his rotating aircraft home getting plenty of media coverage, including interviews with NBC and ads in the DuPont Registry.As of the time of press, the patent is expired since 2018 but has already been discontinued since 2011 due to non-payment of maintenance fees.The Wind Resistant Dwelling or the Boeing 727 on a pole, as it was described in the media at the time, was the fuselage of a Boeing 727 with its tail fin and wings intact. The aircraft is mounted on a support steel column 15 feet (4.5 meters) high, with a bearing and gearing system that grants it a single axis of rotation perpendicular to the ground. Dampening and braking assemblies are housed within the same support column, while the motor-driven gearing would enable “manual” rotation of the aircraft.Otherwise, the aircraft would spin in the wind, much in the manner of a weather vane. Instead of opposing the force of strong winds like a normal house, the Boeing 727 home would rotate with it, always with the nose pointed in the direction of the wind. Its elevated position on the pole would make it flood-proof, so theoretically, you could set one such home up even on the waterway, not just on solid but flood-prone ground.“The fuselage of such an aircraft has been engineered and tested to withstand wind speeds in excess of five hundred (500) mph [805 kph], temperatures below negative fifty (-50) degrees Fahrenheit [-45.56°C] and stress forces greater than 2.5 gravities,” Bennington explained.Its construction meant that it would make a maintenance-free home, free of mold and impervious to bugs and that it would remain so for the next decades, he promised. The vast interior could be arranged into a comfortable home, with all the creature comforts: a kitchen, a full bathroom and a half-bath, a large living room and other common areas, and two bedrooms. The interior would first have to be sorted out before the entire structure was elevated off the ground, as well as connections to the grid for electricity, water, and waste.Initially, Bennington estimated a $200,000 starting price for one such rotating homemade from a retired aircraft , which included everything from the fuselage to its transport to the location, the steel support column, and a basic layout of the interior. The price later went up to $290,000 once he factored in the interior.In 2000, he revealed in an interview that the first production unit was under construction for a Nashville radio station that wanted to use it to host live webcasts. We reached out to Mr. Bennington for clarification on whether delivery took place or not or if other units were ever built, and we’ll update the story when and if we hear back.Bennington knew that his idea could be described as a fad, but he had high hopes it would catch on. In reality, he was convinced it would catch once “once people start living in them.” “It is just nice pointing into the wind and nice that the whole airplane turns. It makes every day different,” he said. It would have , that’s for sure.Mr. Bennington got back to us, saying that he came very close to closing two big deals for his patented Wind Resistant Dwellings, one for three such units, the other for a single 727. Both fell through for reasons independent of his will. Despite the setbacks, he still ""think[s] weather vaning airplanes are a great idea,"" that ""they belong by themselves, like on an island in The Bahamas."" Mr. Bennington is currently working on two projects in this sense, one involving Boeing 737s, and the other an A380, but ""it's been a tough business.""","Remembering the Boeing 727 Home on a Pole, World’s Fastest House That Rotated in the Wind"

The company reported 29 total 737 MAX deliveries for May. Aviation Week Fleet Discovery figures show seven were built in 2019, while the rest rolled out in either 2021 or 2022, or after the model’s 21-month delivery pause ended in December 2020. Counting last month’s activity, Boeing has delivered 250 737 MAXs from the batch of about 460 pre-December 2020 roll-outs that had built up during the pause.

Boeing has been eyeing the end of 2023 as a notional target for clearing out the stored inventory. That requires delivering 35-40 aircraft per month, including about 11 from storage plus a total equivalent to its monthly production rate, which currently sits somewhere between 25 and 30.

The company has not surpassed 40 737 MAX deliveries in any single month since the December 2020 restart and has topped 30 deliveries just three times. Total deliveries in 2022 so far number 138—an average of about 28 per month. Deliveries from inventory have fallen from 16 in March to 11 in April and then into single digits in May.

Other May activity included a sale-leaseback transaction that saw India’s Akasa Air cancel five 737 MAX orders and Bain Capital Griffin book them as new orders. Norwegian also canceled four 787-9s. The majority of Boeing’s 23 gross orders for the month came from Lufthansa Group, which committed to 16 widebodies: seven 787-9s, two 777Fs and seven 777-8Fs. Rounding out the orders, American Airlines purchased one 737 MAX and Eva Air one 777F.

Dubai: Long-haul carrier Emirates successfully flew a Boeing 777 on a test flight Monday with one engine entirely powered by so-called sustainable aviation fuel. This comes as carriers worldwide try to lessen their carbon footprint. Flight No. EK2646 flew for just under an hour over the coastline of the United Arab Emirates , after taking off from Dubai International Airport, the world's busiest for international travel, and heading out into the Persian Gulf before circling back to land.The fuel powered one of Boeing 's two General Electric Co. engines, with the other running on conventional jet fuel for safety.""This flight is a milestone moment for Emirates and a positive step for our industry as we work collectively to address one of our biggest challenges - reducing our carbon footprint,"" Adel al-Redha , Emirates' chief operation officer, said in a statement.Emirates, a state-owned airline under Dubai's ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum , described the sustainable fuel as a blend ""that mirrored the qualities of jet fuel."" It included fuel from Neste , a Finnish firm, and Virent, a Madison, Wisconsin-based company.Virent describes itself as using plant-based sugars to make the compounds needed for sustainable jet fuel, while Neste 's fuel comes from vegetable oils and animal fats. Those fuels reduce the release of heat-trapping carbon dioxide typically burned off by engines in flight.Aviation releases only one-sixth the amount of carbon dioxide produced by cars and trucks, according to World Resources Institute , a nonprofit research group based in Washington. However, aeroplanes are used by far fewer people per day - meaning aviation is a higher per-capita source of greenhouse-gas emissions.Aeroplane and engine manufacturers have been designing more-efficient models, in part to help keep down costs of jet fuel - one of the biggest expenses airlines face. Emirates, for instance, used over 5.7 tons of jet fuel last year alone, costing it USD 3.7 billion out of its USD 17 billion in annual expenses.But analysts suggest sustainable fuels can be three times or more the cost of jet fuel, likely putting ticket prices even higher as aviation restarts following the lockdowns during the coronavirus pandemic.It wasn't immediately clear how much the fuel used in the Emirates' test on Monday cost per barrel. Jet fuel cost on average USD 146 a barrel at the end of last week, according to S&P Global Platts The UAE, a major oil producer and OPEC member, is to host the next United Nations climate negotiations, or COP28, beginning in November.Already, the seven sheikhdom federation has come under fire from activists for nominating the CEO of Abu Dhabi's state oil company to lead the UN negotiations known as the Conference of the Parties - where COP gets its name.","Carrier Emirates test flies Boeing 777 on sustainable fuel, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld"

The aerospace giant says going digital will boost revenue, while eliminating design and production hurdles and also potentially save time on development.

“It’s about strengthening engineering,” Boeing’s chief engineer Greg Hyslop told Reuters in December when describing the company’s turn to a digital ecosystem. “We are talking about changing the way we work across the entire company.”

Hyslop told Reuters the overwhelming number of production quality issues stem from design problems. An overall digital ecosystem would improve both design and production. If successful, the timeline from concept to market could shrink to as short as four to five years, Reuters reported.

The new partnership announcement, made Wednesday, “represents a significant investment in Boeing’s digital future,” Susan Doniz, Boeing chief information officer and senior vice president of information technology and data analytics, said in a statement.

“Our cloud strategy removes infrastructure restraints, allowing for more ownership within teams, simplifies our processes, creates easier and more secure access to information, and empowers our people to perform their best,” she said.

The partnerships represent Boeing’s move to centralize applications while also keeping pace with its competition.

Boeing rival Airbus has been ramping up its digital ecosystem program, dubbed Digital Design and Manufacturing Services (DDMS) for the past five years. DDMS aims to fully transform Airbus’ design, manufacturing, and overall operations to a digital-first model from end to end. The goal: cut costs and reduce time to market while ensuring quality, safety, and environmental performance.

As part of its deal with Amazon Web Services, Boeing said it will migrate applications out of on-premise data centers to the AWS cloud, a move the company said will strengthen engineering and manufacturing processes.

“Boeing and AWS share a builder culture and are committed to using advanced technologies to take on the most ambitious engineering feats like developing new sustainable energy sources and interplanetary human travel,” Matt Garman, senior vice president of sales and marketing at AWS, said in a statement “AWS’s proven cloud infrastructure and deep portfolio of services allow Boeing to create new solutions for its global customers and suppliers that will increase innovation and adaptability to enhance the movement of people and goods around the world, including Amazon’s own deliveries for our customers through Amazon Air.”

Boeing said it also intends to migrate hundreds of applications across multiple business groups and aerospace products through the partnership with Google Cloud. By using the technology, Boeing software developers will be able to design applications that can then be deployed companywide.

It’s a partnership the aerospace company said will help them address traditional IT implementation challenges, while also offering the advantage of Google Cloud’s data analytics and artificial intelligence/machine learning tools.

“Google Cloud will help us modernize our applications; empower our people with the latest technology, tools and expertise; and continuously innovate with rapid software changes,” Doniz said. “With Google Cloud’s years of cloud leadership, data analytics, and AI/ML experience, we are looking forward to driving advanced digital aerospace solutions together.”

Boeing said it turned to a partnership with Microsoft Cloud for its AI capabilities to update technical infrastructure and mission-critical applications.

“Our strategic partnership with Microsoft will help us realize our cloud strategy by removing infrastructure restraints, properly scaling to unlock innovation and further strengthening our commitment to sustainable operations,” Doniz said.

The IT infrastructure awards don’t come cheap, however.

July 27 (Reuters) - Commercial jets delivered by Boeing Co (BA.N) last year will account on average for emissions equivalent to 1 million tonnes of carbon dioxide each over their 20-year-plus lifespans, a new report from the planemaker shows.

Boeing is the latest company to report so-called Scope 3 emissions that result when customers use their products, amid pressure from investors and climate activists for data on how companies are performing on limiting their environmental impact.

The report sheds further light on the task facing global aviation as it faces calls by environmental groups for curbs to air travel and growing political pressure to cut emissions, after Europe's Airbus (AIR.PA) issued similar data in February.

Together, the world's two largest planemakers in 2020 delivered jets estimated to be responsible for total emissions equivalent to 600 million tonnes of CO2 over their lifetimes, a figure dampened by lower deliveries during the pandemic.

Aviation produces up to 3% of man-made CO2 emissions and 12% of CO2 from transport, the industry says. It has pledged to reduce net carbon emissions to 50% of 2005 levels by 2050, but is moving towards a tougher target of eliminating net emissions.

Boeing aims to ""significantly reduce our environmental impact during every stage of a product’s life cycle,"" Chief Executive Dave Calhoun said introducing the Chicago-based company's first-ever sustainability report on Monday.

Calhoun reiterated that its jets would fly on 100% sustainable aviation fuels by 2030. Jet engines are currently certified to run on up to 50% of the fuel.

In the report, Boeing said commercial airplanes it delivered in 2020 would be responsible for emissions equivalent to 158 million tonnes of CO2, or MtCO2e, over their lifespan.

That consists of 136 million tonnes of emissions directly linked to their operation by airlines, and 22 million tonnes related to the production by energy companies of the fuel used in flight.

Boeing has said it delivered 157 airplanes in 2020, suggesting each jet will on average generate emissions equating to 866,000 tonnes of CO2 over its lifespan, or 1 million tonnes including indirect emissions linked to fuel production.

'HIGH PRICE TAG'

By contrast, Airbus in February said it had delivered 566 jets in 2020 with estimated lifetime emissions of 440 million tonnes, including 80 million for fuel production.

That equates to lower emissions per airplane compared with Boeing's data, or 636,000 tonnes through direct operations, and 777,000 tonnes including related oil-industry emissions.

Experts said comparisons are blurred by different assumptions on the average length of a jet's service.

Airbus assumed an average 22-year lifespan for its jets. A Boeing spokesman said it assumed 22.8 years for single-aisle aircraft, 21.5 years for twin-aisles and 29.6 years for freighters. Based on Boeing's 2020 delivery data by type, that suggests a weighted average of 24.8 years, Reuters calculates.

Boeing also dominates the market for freighters, which fly longer and had an unusually high share of 2020 deliveries.

In 2018, the last year of undisturbed data before Boeing was hit by successive crises over the grounded 737 MAX passenger plane and COVID-19, its emissions per airplane appeared more in line with the trends reported by its rival.

For the 806 jets delivered that year, Boeing expects direct lifetime emissions of 560 millions tonnes, or 652 million including fuel production, a spokesperson said.

Aerospace firms say they are accelerating global research on new technology and promoting cleaner, alternative fuels.

But environmentalist groups insist that flying itself needs to be limited to have a meaningful impact on climate change.

""The data confirms that Boeing’s aircraft come with a high environmental price tag,"" said Dan Rutherford, aviation director at the International Council on Clean Transportation, an environmental research group based in Washington.

Both Boeing and Airbus say their estimates do not include the impact of an expected increase in the use of sustainable aviation fuels, which would cut emissions further. The European Union this month proposed new targets for the fuel.

Long-haul carrier Emirates successfully flew a Boeing 777 on a test flight Monday with one of its two engines entirely powered by so-called sustainable aviation fuel. This comes as carriers worldwide try to lessen their carbon footprint.

Flight 2646 flew for just under an hour over the coastline of the United Arab Emirates, after taking off from Dubai International Airport, the world's busiest for international travel, and heading out into the Persian Gulf before circling to land. The second of the plane's General Electric Co. engines ran on conventional jet fuel for safety.

“This flight is a milestone moment for Emirates and a positive step for our industry as we work collectively to address one of our biggest challenges — reducing our carbon footprint,"" Adel al-Redha, Emirates' chief operation officer, said in a statement.

Emirates, a state-owned airline under Dubai's ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, described the sustainable fuel as a blend “that mirrored the qualities of jet fuel.” It included fuel from Neste, a Finnish firm, and Virent, a Madison, Wisconsin-based company.

Virent describes itself as using plant-based sugars to make the compounds needed for sustainable jet fuel, while Neste's fuel comes from vegetable oils and animal fats. Those fuels reduce the release of heat-trapping carbon dioxide typically burned off by engines in flight.

Aviation releases only one-sixth the amount of carbon dioxide produced by cars and trucks, according to World Resources Institute, a nonprofit research group based in Washington. However, airplanes are used by far fewer people per day — meaning aviation is a higher per-capita source of greenhouse-gas emissions.

Airplane and engine manufacturers have been designing more-efficient models, in part to help keep down costs of jet fuel — one of the biggest expenses airlines face. Emirates, for instance, used over 5.7 million tons of jet fuel last year alone, costing it US$3.7 billion out of its $17 billion in annual expenses.

But analysts suggest sustainable fuels can be three times or more the cost of jet fuel, likely putting ticket prices even higher as aviation restarts following the lockdowns during the coronavirus pandemic.

It wasn't immediately clear how much the fuel used in the Emirates' test on Monday cost per barrel. Jet fuel cost on average $146 a barrel at the end of last week, according to S&P Global Platts.

The UAE, a major oil producer and OPEC member, is to host the next United Nations climate negotiations, or COP28, beginning in November. Already, the seven sheikhdom federation has been criticized for nominating the CEO of Abu Dhabi's state oil company to lead the U.N. negotiations known as the Conference of the Parties — where COP gets its name.",Carrier Emirates test flies Boeing 777 on sustainable fuel

Wizz Air has entered into a new agreement with Neste to purchase and use SAFs from 2025 onwards. The agreement gives the airline the purchasing option of more than 36,000 tonnes of SAFs annually.

Organisations backing SAFs claim that the solution can reduce life-cycle emissions by up to 80% compared to traditional jet fuel. However, most airlines currently only use it in small proportions in blends – partly due to a lack of supply and partly because current international regulations limit biofuel blends to 50%.

Wizz Air’s executive vice president Ian Malin said: “At Wizz Air, we continue to invest in innovative technology and believe that SAF is a key part of the solution for decarbonizing the aviation industry. The partnership with Neste, the world’s leading producer of SAF, reaffirms our progress in reducing our carbon emissions intensity, which is already one of the lowest in the world.

“Working together with Neste, we will drive the adoption of SAF throughout our network, paving the way to a more sustainable future for aviation,”

The new agreement builds on the airline’s commitment to reduce carbon emissions intensity per passenger kilometre by 25% by 2030 and reach net-zero by 2050.

Heathrow’s SAF target

The announcement comes as the UK’s largest airport has called for more Government support to help increase the uptake of SAFs.

Heathrow Airport announced this week that it was aiming to triple its SAF usage this year, from 0.5% to 1.5%. However, the company’s chief executive has called for more legislative support, as reported by the BBC.

In 2021, Heathrow Airport incorporated aviation fuel made from waste oils and fats for the first time. The SAFs are HEFA (Hydrotreated Esters and Fatty Acids) and consist of waste vegetable oils, waste oils and fats. According to Neste, its SAFs can reduce emissions by up to 80% compared to fossil fuel jet use over the life cycle.

The SAF used was equivalent to fuelling 5-10 short-haul flights, but Heathrow stated at the time that it could act as a base to establish proof of concept that SAFs can be used on a commercial scale to reduce emissions.

The Airport has since updated its sustainability strategy, pledging a 15% reduction in carbon in absolute terms from flight emissions by 2030, against a 2030 baseline. The Airport states that it will increase the use of SAFs, improve the efficiency of aircraft and modernise airspace to reach the target. Electric aircraft are not mentioned and neither is capping growth in passenger numbers.

The Airport first unveiled its ‘Heathrow 2.0’ sustainability strategy in 2017, setting 2050 targets for zero-carbon operations and flights as well as zero-waste operations and 100% sustainable water consumption.

Under UK policy, the Government is proposing that airlines operating in the UK ensure that SAFs account for at least 10% of their fuel demand by 2030.

Boeing’s purchase

Last week, Boeing agreed to purchase 5.6 million gallons (21.2 million liters) of blended sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) produced by Neste, in a move that will more than double the company’s SAF procurement from last year.

“We are demonstrating our commitment to reduce our carbon footprint and catalyse the SAF industry,” Boeing’s vice president of environmental sustainability Sheila Remes said.

“This SAF procurement makes up 25% of Boeing’s total jet fuel needs for last year including our production, delivery, Boeing ecoDemonstrator, and Dreamlifter flights, and we aim to increase that portion in the years to come.”

Boeing claims that the SAFs meet or exceed the safety and technical specifications it is subjected to and also has a “drop-in” capability so it can be blended directly with petroleum jet fuel. The new agreements will see SAFs blended with conventional jet fuel at a 30/70 ratio.

These criteria are based on internationally recognized sustainability standards, such as those established by the Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials.

Boeing is notably planning to debut commercial aircraft capable of using 100% biofuel by 2030. Commercial planes at present can only use blends of up to 50%. A Boeing spokesperson told edie that SAF procurement made up 25% of Boeing’s total jet fuel needs for last year.

Boeing is a member of the Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance (SABA) which is being operated by the Environmental Defence Fund and Rocky Mountain Institute, with support for the Climate Group, best known for schemes such as RE100 and EV100.","Wizz Air, Heathrow and Boeing unveil sustainable aviation fuel plans"

Regenera leverages CEMEX’s global expertise and infrastructure to use municipal waste and industrial byproducts as sustainable substitutes for fossil fuels and natural raw materials in its production processes.

In the Philippines, where waste generation is a growing concern, the Regenera program is especially relevant. According to the World Bank, a staggering 2.7 million tons of plastic waste are generated in the Philippines annually, and an estimated 20 percent ends up in the ocean.

“We believe that a circular economy is critical for building a sustainable future. By utilizing wastes into alternative fuels for our cement manufacturing process, we significantly contribute to diverting wastes from landfills, and helps reduce emissions,” said Luis Franco, CEMEX Holdings Philippines President & CEO.

CEMEX Philippines has partnered with more than 30 local government units and various private organizations to further these initiatives. For instance, the partnership with Unilever Philippines and the City Government of Pasig incentivized households and community junk shops towards the proper segregation and recycling of flexible plastic waste. Another project involves plastic waste reduction efforts between CEMEX and Plastic Credit Exchange (PCX), Greencycle, and Friends of Hope, Inc. (HOPE).

The most recent partnership with Manila Water was also signed to use biosolids as alternative fuels, which is a first in the Philippines and a significant accomplishment in helping to reduce carbon footprint. In another effort to reduce waste, in 2022, CEMEX partnered with the Metro Manila Development Authority (MMDA) in co-processing election-related materials such as tarpaulin, banners, and posters in its Solid Cement Plant in Antipolo City. The company will continue to work with key stakeholders to advance its co-processing initiative and promote sustainable solid waste management practices.

“The launch of Regenera is not just about reducing our environmental impact; it’s about taking a leadership role in promoting sustainability and circular economy. We are committed to investing in innovative solutions and collaborating with our stakeholders to drive positive change, and turning wastes into alternative fuels is just one example of how we bring our commitment to sustainability to life,” Franco emphasized.

The Regenera is one of the key drivers of CEMEX Future in Action agenda. Ultimately, CEMEX aims to be a net-zero carbon company by 2050. Regenera has been implemented in several countries around the world, including Mexico, Colombia, Costa Rica, and the United Kingdom.

(""CEMEX"") announced today that the U.S. Department of Energy awarded US$3.2 million to Solar MEAD, a joint project headed by CEMEX, Sandia National Laboratories, and Synhelion, which aims to decarbonize cement production.

Solar MEAD aims to replace the use of fossil fuels with concentrated solar thermal (“CST”) energy in clinker production, the key component in cement. CEMEX and Synhelion have been collaborating to introduce CST in the cement production process, achieving the first successful laboratory-scale demonstrative pilot in 2022 by producing the first-ever solar clinker. Sandia Laboratories will contribute unique research facilities as part of the National Solar Thermal Test Facility, and subject matter expertise to help accelerate the adaptation of the technology to cement manufacturing.

Synhelion's breakthrough technology delivers high-temperature process heat beyond 1,500 degrees Celsius – sufficient heat to produce clinker without using fossil fuels.

""Cement produced with solar energy is an exciting technology with tremendous potential to reduce the carbon footprint of cement production,"" said Fernando A. González, CEO of CEMEX. ""Achieving our net zero carbon goal by 2050 will require relentless innovation such as this to discover and scale breakthrough technologies.""

""Few renewable technologies are capable of generating heat at the temperatures needed to process raw cement feedstock,"" said Nathan Schroeder, Sandia researcher and principal investigator for the Solar MEAD project. ""This project will advance our understanding of how to use concentrating solar technology to gather and deliver the heat to existing cement production facilities and will have crosscutting relevance to other ore processing industries such as refractory, ceramics, and battery production.""

Gianluca Ambrosetti, CEO and Co-Founder of Synhelion, added: ""The project offers us the opportunity to use our sustainable technology to support the decarbonization of energy-intensive cement clinker production. This solution can have a huge impact on the industry and will help to pave the way towards net-zero. We are proud of contributing to this goal.""

The project will investigate methods to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, lower process temperatures, and increase the efficiency of clinker formation using solar energy. The team will assess the conditions to maximize heat transfer to the raw cement mix.

Successful adoption of this technology in cement manufacturing will not only allow for 100% replacement of fossil fuels but also result in a more efficient and lower-cost carbon capture process when compared to the current state-of-the-art technologies.

Clinker is produced by fusing limestone, clay, and other materials in a rotary kiln at temperatures nearing 1,500°C. Fossil fuels are typically used to heat the kiln and are responsible for approximately 40% of the direct CO 2 emissions of the process. Replacing fossil fuels entirely with solar energy is a game-changer in the industry's efforts to achieve carbon neutrality.

(“CEMEX”) announced today that it is reaffirming its commitment to the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly those focused on climate action; sustainable cities and communities; responsible consumption and production; and industry, innovation, and infrastructure.

CEMEX’s CEO, Fernando A. González, participated in a CEO roundtable hosted by UN Secretary-General António Guterres at the UN’s New York City headquarters on Monday, Sept. 19. The roundtable included 11 CEOs representing companies from around the globe and focused on proposals for strengthening the private sector’s commitment to the SDGs.

“CEMEX’s core purpose is to build a better, more sustainable, future,” said Fernando A. González. “We recently agreed to strengthen our partnership with the UN on topics aligned with our strategy and areas of expertise including sustainable finance, supply chain, diversity and inclusion, and a just transition to a carbon neutral economy. Moreover, through our flagship decarbonization program, Future in Action, we seek to lead the way in climate action for the building materials industry.”

In 2022, for the second consecutive year, the world achieved little progress towards the SDG 2030 targets. The roundtable united leaders from companies that are strongly contributing to the UN Global Compact (UNGC) to discuss how to inspire ambitious and principled business leadership committed to achieving the SDGs. The UNGC is the world’s largest corporate sustainability initiative, and an ideal platform for the private sector to align its strategies and operations to the SDGs.

Recent contributions to the SDGs by CEMEX include the launch of Vertua, its lower-carbon and net-zero CO 2 family of products; agreements to clean beaches and waterways, including the Nile River, and use the recovered waste as an alternative fuel in its operations; a new concrete 3D printing construction solution with the potential to reduce housing costs; and the transition of several cement plants to renewable electricity.

(“CEMEX”) announced today that it has added nearly 200 lower-carbon natural gas-powered trucks as part of a comprehensive strategy seeking to decarbonize its global fleet. This initiative is part of the company’s flagship Future in Action program to become a net-zero CO 2 company by 2050.

The investment in these 200 new vehicles consist mostly of concrete mixer trucks powered by low emission compressed natural gas (CNG) or renewable natural gas (RNG). These trucks will have a carbon footprint that is approximately 25% lower than the diesel trucks they are replacing. Over half of the vehicles are in Mexico, with the remaining half split between Southern California in the U.S. and Colombia.

“Decarbonizing our global fleet requires a multi-pronged approach built on innovation,” said Juan Romero, CEMEX Executive Vice President of Sustainability, Commercial and Operations Development. “Our strategy combines taking immediate action to reduce our carbon footprint with currently available state-of-the-art technology, while at the same time collaborating with our partners to discover, pilot, and scale the solutions needed to achieve net-zero.”

Overall, CEMEX has an ambitious 2030 Scope 3 goal to reduce transport carbon emissions by 20% and is committed to reaching overall net-zero emissions by 2050. Scope 3 emissions are indirect emissions, including those from upstream and downstream transportation and distribution.

Natural gas-powered trucks are a transitional technology that will permit an immediate reduction of carbon emissions. Natural gas, biodiesel and hybrid power are the most readily available lower-carbon transition technologies.

CEMEX is a founding member of the First Movers Coalition, which brings together business leaders with global footprints to create market demand for zero carbon solutions in this decade and jump-start the scaling of these emerging technologies. The company committed to making approximately 30% of its heavy-duty transport purchases zero-emissions by 2030. To that end, CEMEX has completed a multi-country pilot using fully electric ready-mix concrete trucks. Fully electric heavy-duty trucks are not yet available at scale, but CEMEX is collaborating with several original equipment manufacturers on new transportation technology that will enable a net-zero emissions future. CEMEX expects to gradually continue introducing and testing new prototypes for zero-emission ready-mix concrete trucks to its fleet.

The agreement supports end-to-end plastic waste reduction processes, starting from plastic waste collection, consolidation, aggregation, treatment, and concluding in co-processing, preventing them from ending up in landfills, bodies of water, or the environment.

“We are very pleased to enter into this agreement which demonstrates our pivotal role in a circular economy, further strengthening our track towards carbon neutrality by 2050,” said Luis Franco, President and CEO of CEMEX Philippines.

“PCX is proud to be a part of this important agreement in support of our mission to end plastic waste entering nature,” said Sebastian DiGrande, CEO of PCX. “This partnership enables the responsible disposal of end-of-life plastics that have no other channels for recycling and provides a valuable bridge in the transition to a truly circular economy for plastics,” Sebastian added.

World Bank reports that by 2050, global waste generation is expected to grow to 3.4 billion tons per year, or a 70% increase compared to 2016. This increase consequently increases greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions since they are linked to global waste generation. Specific to plastics, reports show that the world’s production of plastic waste is twice as much as two decades ago, with most of it ending up in landfills or bodies of water, and only about 9% are effectively recycled. Decomposition in landfills produces methane gas, a greenhouse gas that is 25 times as potent as carbon dioxide at trapping heat in the atmosphere.

“Due to the large volume of plastics generated everywhere, CEMEX’s co-processing solution using plastic waste as alternative fuels undoubtedly helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions, lessening dependence on fossil fuels,” Franco highlighted.

“No single company can address the huge challenge of plastic waste. Companies need to work together, such as what we have with PCX and CEMEX, to increase the chances of creating a sustainable and better planet,” said Greencycle General Manager Roland Vera Cruz.

Under the agreement, PCX, which owns and operates the Plastic Credit Exchange, will facilitate the certification, sale, and purchase of plastic credits to sustainability-conscious businesses to responsibly offset their plastic footprint and reduce plastic flow into nature. Greencycle, on the other hand, will deliver and supply pre-treated post-consumer plastic waste to CEMEX Philippines’ Solid Cement plant in Antipolo City as Refuse-Derived Fuels (RDF). This waste will be co-processed by Solid Cement as an alternative fuel and/or as a part component in its primary business of manufacturing and production of cement.

Co-processing is a proven sustainable waste disposal solution in which segregated plastics are processed at extremely high temperatures to break materials down into simpler compounds. The non-recyclable wastes, such as plastics, are then converted into usable heat to help in cement production, lessening operational dependency on fuel and electricity use and effectively contributing to a decrease in carbon emissions. The process is monitored in compliance with the standards set by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR).

“This partnership is a significant step in making sure we maximise every opportunity to increase the use of alternative fuels, ensuring we are forerunners of circular economy and innovation,” said Luis Franco, CEMEX Philippines President CEO.

“Co-processing of these as alternative fuels to power our plants help reduce CO 2 emissions in the atmosphere and lessen our dependence on fossil fuels, which is aligned to CEMEX’s Future in Action program aimed at becoming a net-zero CO 2 company by 2050,” Franco added.

Biosolids are organic materials coming from a sewage treatment process. Wastewater undergoes full treatment and clean water is discharged to rivers, and byproducts such as biosolids can be turned into useful resource, such as alternative fuels. Use of biosolids as alternative fuels is an important step to sustainability and developing climate-friendly energy solutions that help address climate change.

“This is circular economy, and this is the way to stand up to what’s important in the way we do business. It’s very responsible and a very relevant initiative,” said JV Emmanuel De Dios, Manila Water Company President and CEO.

CEMEX Philippines has been offering co-processing as a reliable and efficient waste management solution. Currently, there are more than 30 local government units and corporations working together with CEMEX in pursuing innovative and effective waste management system in the Philippines. These partnerships have helped reduce wastes that end up in landfills or bodies of water.

The partnership with water and wastewater service provider Manila Water Company will utilise the co-processing technology of CEMEX which has demonstrated to be a proven sustainable waste disposal solution recognised by the Department of Environment and Natural resources (DENR). Under the able leadership of Sec. Toni Yulo-Loyzaga, DENR has been actively promoting and pursuing solutions to address the impacts of climate change through sustainable waste disposal.

“An initial 10 metric tons of dried biosolids has been delivered from our Makati South Sewage Treatment Plant to the CEMEX Antipolo Plant, which we hope to scale up very soon,” said Donna Cabalona-Perez, Manila Water’s head of Wastewater Operations.

“As pioneers in the country of biosolids as alternative fuels, we have just signed what will now create the series of significant steps towards making circular economy a reality,” said Christer Gaudiano, CEMEX Philippines’ Sustainability and Public Affairs Director.

The co-processing technology involves the use of a cement kiln, a furnace operating at extremely hot temperatures of around 1500°C that guarantees the complete breakdown of waste and toxic substances. The technology eliminates residual waste, eventually reducing landfill space in the long-term.","CEMEX, Manila Water pioneer use of biosolids for alternative fuels"

It will require so many changes in how we have done these things so far, that we can barely imagine such a different world today.

One example is cement production, which, made the way that it’s been made so far with fossil fuels, generates 8% of global CO2 emissions. But two firms have been working on a way to make cement for a future without carbon emissions.

The “hot solar” startup Synhelion is creating alternatives to fossil fuels in both solar fuels and direct industrial heat with the solar technology in which mirrors (heliostats) concentrate and reflect the sun’s rays up to a solar receiver to generate heat. Synhelion has achieved the highest temperature possible today in this solar technology; 1500°C.

A year ago we covered initial work being done on decarbonizing cement processes in a partnership between Synhelion and the international cement producer CEMEX headquartered in Mexico.

Now Synhelion and CEMEX engineers have built a pilot plant, on the Very High Concentration Solar Tower of IMDEA Energy in Spain to produce zero CO2 cement, by substituting direct solar heat for fossil fired heat in one of the world’s most carbon-intensive industries.

That collaboration has now borne its first fruit. Synhelion and CEMEX have produced the first solar clinker in the world.

For this application, in cement production, the solar heat will be piped to a long kiln in the cement factory where the calcination and clinkerization is performed.

Calcination requires heat at about 1000°C for several minutes. Initially the plan was to supply heat just for this calcination process entirely from solar energy, while also siphoning off the natural CO2 emissions which happen due to the chemical reaction, for a 100% emissions-free calcination process.

In the demo the team have gone even further than they initially planned

“We didn’t stop our system at calcination,” explained Dr. Gianluca Ambrosetti, CEO and Co-Founder of Synhelion. “We went further to higher temperatures and performed even the clinkerization, which happens at around 1400 to 1450 degrees.”

This second step; clinkerization is much more of a challenge for solar heat. Not only is the heat requirement greater, but the residence time is longer, up to 30 minutes for each cohort of material rotating through the almost 90 meters-long kiln, and it is operating continuously.

Once the lumps of clinker are produced, they are then combined with gypsum and sent to a grinding mill to become the finished product – powdered cement.

About 95% of the CO2 emissions in cement production come from these two steps, the calcination and the clinkerization. Only about 5% comes from powering the grinding process, which uses electricity.

This is a major breakthrough for solar heat, building on research from the SolPART project that CEMEX was involved in. At the time, Gilles Flamant, who directs the lab testing solar reactors at CNRS-PROMES, cautioned that the most difficult aspect of substituting solar heat for cement making is this duration. “My feeling is that the problem of residence time is actually the critical issue in this, not the heat requirement,” he explained.

“What we achieved is a real milestone in the sense that we managed to go beyond – to also do the clinkerization,” added Davide Zampini, CEMEX Head of Global R&D. “What Synhelion is doing, to be able to reach the 1500 degrees, is essential for us because now we can go beyond calcination. This is a key element. It allows us to completely eliminate fossil fuels from the production of clinker in cement.”

Using the traditional fossil fuel method, the calcination step generates CO2 in two ways. About 60% is from the chemical reaction itself, and 40% is from burning fossil fuel to heat the reaction.

How the solar process eliminates both sources of cement emissions

For this solar process, the heat is not from fossil fuel combustion like traditional cement production, but from sunlight reflected from a solar field of mirrors that concentrates highly focused solar flux up to a receiver on a tower.

Then the heat this creates is carried in a heat transfer fluid, piped down to the kiln in a stream of very high temperature water vapor and CO2.

Because this heat transfer fluid is in a closed loop with no air, it is easy to separate out and siphon off the CO2 from the calcination chemical reaction in a pure stream, by condensing out the water which leaves just CO2 behind.

By contrast, when a fossil fuel is burned in air, it is expensive to capture the emissions because the CO2 is very diluted in the predominantly nitrogen mix of air. This costliness of capturing CO2 in air is why it is not being done, despite political incentives.

“This is an important part of the project, to capture that CO2,” Zampini noted. “Thanks to the fact that it’s a slightly different process because we are using solar heat instead of combustion, capturing the CO2 becomes easy. This is a huge benefit for us as a cement manufacturer. We don’t emit any CO2 into the atmosphere with this process.”

To make the heat transfer fluid onsite, Synhelion would siphon off the carbon dioxide emitted by limestone naturally during the calcination step and use some of it mixed with water vapor. It would keep the remaining CO2 it captured for use by its core business of manufacturing solar fuels from H2O and CO2.

“That’s why this is really elegant,” said Zampini. “Besides CEMEX being the first to produce a solar clinker, Synhelion was born as a company that produces solar synfuels, so it also has a use for the CO2 to make its jet fuels.”

One thing the teams were looking to make sure of was that the solar process would not alter any chemical reactions in cement processes. The testing proved that this was successful.

Next step

“So far, what we have done was a batch process, we didn’t have a continuous process. We produced a few kilograms of clinker,” said Ambrosetti. “We now develop this system further to have kilns that can produce clinker in a continuous fashion. Performing the process continuously is the goal that we want to achieve this year.”

At scale, Ambrosetti said the solar field for a cement plant making ten tons a day of cement would be about the size of today’s tower Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) plants, in the range of several hundred thousand square meters of heliostat area. Remarkably, Synhelion achieves its much higher temperatures from the same size solar field as a conventional tower CSP plant producing heat at a much lower 565°C.

“This comes from our novel receiver design,” Ambrosetti explained. “We can achieve 1,500°C at fairly low concentration, at around a thousand suns, one megawatt per square meter. For a 1,000 tons of clinker per day setup, we would need about 150 megawatts thermal solar input to the receiver. So, this would be around 300,000 square meters of heliostats.”

Ambrosetti noted that Synhelion has already solved the materials issues with operation at such high temperatures. “These high temperatures do create some constraints on material but with our design of receiver, basically a refractory lined cavity, we can use standard materials from the refractory industry and the ones used in a kiln.”

At scale, to maintain the supplied heat continuously, this system would include thermal energy storage like in a solar thermal energy plant. In the next step, incorporating storage, CEMEX and Synhelion will produce clinker in larger quantities to reach industrial scale.",CEMEX and Synhelion ace the First “Hot Solar” Cement Trial

CEMEX achieved a milestone 41% reduction* in the CO2 emissions generated by their European cement business in 2022, demonstrating the company’s dedication to increasing the sustainability of its operations through a concerted climate action strategy: Future in Action.

A fifth of the total reduction attained since 1990 happened in the last two years, with a drop of more than 12% from 2020 performance, clearly showing the acceleration of CEMEX’s efforts to cut emissions.

Sergio Menendez, regional president for CEMEX EMEA, commented: ‘We are very proud to have reached a 41% reduction in CO2 emissions generated by our European cement business, and this is all thanks to the commitment of our teams to pursuing climate action, circularity, and natural resource management.

‘As we begin to implement the next stages in our climate action strategy, we now expect to exceed our 2030 aspiration of hitting a 55% CO2 reduction in our European operations. While we are progressing important carbon capture projects and policy advocacy for our ultimate net-zero target, these 2030 interim aspirations are not reliant on this technology.’

‘This is certainly a challenging target, but I am confident that with innovative thinking, close collaboration between our different business areas, and further development of our regulatory framework, it is both feasible and profitable. This sustained effort is vital if we are to meet our global, primary objective of becoming a net-zero CO2 company by 2050.’

CEMEX’s European cement operations were able to achieve the substantial CO2 emission reduction in 2022 thanks to significant developments in their climate action activity, including a large investment in a new alternative-fuels facility in the UK, investment in solar energy at sites in countries including Germany and Poland, plus an increasing supply of the company’s more sustainable Vertua products across the region.

MEXICO CITY, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Mexican cement maker Cemex said on Wednesday it had achieved the first step in fully powering plants with solar energy, producing what is known as clinker via the sun's rays.

Cemex said in a statement it had teamed up with Swiss solar company Synhelion to produce clinker, a limestone and clay mix used to make cement, with ""record-breaking"" solar heat.

The move to produce clinker via solar heat is part of Cemex's push to go carbon neutral by 2050, as current clinker production uses fossil fuels to heat limestone and clay.

""Cemex is building a better future, and that future must be sustainable,"" Cemex Chief Executive Fernando Gonzalez said in the statement.

The two companies say the pilot was the first time clinker was made through solar energy, though scientists have been toying with the idea since the early 2000s. Now, Cemex and Synhelion hope to bring the project to an industrial scale.

Cemex has previously said it is also exploring clinker alternatives, like burnt shale oil or glass furnace slag. read more

Cemex and other cement makers have felt pressure in recent years from regulators and investors to reduce CO2 emissions. Cement, a key ingredient in concrete, contributes to about 8% of global CO2 emissions, according to one think tank.

However, the companies have said they are up against a number of factors, such as lack of technology, restrictive code enforcement and pressure to keep costs low.

In the United States, which accounts for around 22% of Cemex's sales, building codes leave little room for climate-friendly concrete, Cemex officials have said.

Cemex officials told Reuters last year it would meet its climate goals by using renewable energy and alternative fuels.

The partnership aims to expand solid waste collection operations in the river, whose resources are needed especially by the fishing community of Qursaya Island in the Cairo metropolitan area.

“We will co-treat the waste that is dumped to contribute to the ‘zero waste in landfills’ challenge, with a view to protecting the Nile from behaviours that lead to its pollution,” says Fernando Gonzales, Cemex’s CEO. The company, based in San Pedro Garza García, Mexico, is mainly active in the cement, concrete and aggregates sector in Egypt.

According to Khaled El-Farra, Director of the Environment and Sustainable Development Department of the Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, this partnership will last for three years and will allow the collection of approximately 20 tons of waste per month. In addition to financial support, Cemex will strengthen the equipment used for waste collection and contribute to the promotion of the circular economy in the Cairo governorate.

Ridding the Nile of solid waste

The second longest river in the world after the Amazon (6,692 km) in South America, the Nile is polluted by sewage, waste, and pesticides used for agriculture, especially in its delta. According to the Egyptian Ministry of the Environment, the Nile is also the outlet for 549 million m3 of liquid industrial waste every year. The chemicals and heavy metals it contains come directly from the 345 industrial complexes located along the Nile between Aswan and Cairo.

In this context, VeryNile is setting up a sustainable ecosystem to recycle plastic and other fishermen’s waste collected from the river. The initiative was launched in 2018 by start-ups Bassita, which specialises in cyber awareness and fundraising for positive initiatives, and Greenish which designs and implements sustainable environmental solutions.

The platform also raises awareness against the use of single-use plastic. “VeryNile was created with a strong commitment to preserve the Nile by removing plastics and harmful waste from the river while empowering local communities,” says Alban de Menonville, founder of VeryNile based in the Egyptian city of Giza.

This comes in addition to Coolbrook’s existing partnerships with ABB and Shell. The Roto Dynamic Heater (RDH) technology uses electrification to remove the need for the burning of fossil fuels in the highest-emitting industrial processes. Powered by electricity from renewable sources, the RDH is the only process heating technology in the world that can cut up to 30% of industrial CO2 emissions and over 7% of global CO2 emissions annually, the company says.

Industrial CO2 emissions originate primarily from three main sectors: petrochemicals and chemicals, iron and steel, and cement production. The RDH, powered by electricity from renewable sources, can achieve process temperatures of up to around 1700 ºC with high energy efficiency and can thereby be used in processes that were impossible to electrify up until now. RDH is the only electric technology able to reach temperature levels required in highest-emitting industrial sectors such as petrochemicals and chemicals, iron and steel and cement, according to Coolbrook. Due to its compact size, the RDH can also be retro-fitted to existing facilities and thereby significantly accelerate the much needed CO2 emission reduction investments.

The technology has been in development for over a decade and marks the second major technology developed by Coolbrook after its Roto Dynamic Reactor (RDR), which can be used to electrify the steam cracking process in the petrochemical industry.

Roberto Ponguta, Cemex VP of global operations for technical and energy said, “The electrification of the production process is an important step towards fully decarbonizing our cement operations. We are constantly looking for the best technologies and relationships to meet our Net Zero CO2 target. Our cooperation with Coolbrook will support us in achieving this ambition.”

Cemex has also recently successfully tested a process that converts flue gasses emitted by the cement kiln into carbon nanomaterials, thereby transforming “bad” carbon into “good” carbon.

'This partnership is a significant step in making sure we maximize every opportunity to increase the use of alternative fuels, ensuring we are forerunners of circular economy and innovation,' said Luis Franco, Cemex Philippines president and CEO.

'Co-processing of these as alternative fuels to power our plants help reduce CO2 emissions in the atmosphere and lessen our dependence on fossil fuels, which is aligned to Cemex's Future in Action program aimed at becoming a net-zero CO2 company by 2050,' he said.

Biosolids are organic materials coming from a sewage treatment process. Wastewater undergoes full treatment and clean water is discharged to rivers, and byproducts such as biosolids can be turned into useful resource, such as alternative fuels. Use of biosolids as alternative fuels is an important step to sustainability and developing climate-friendly energy solutions that help address climate change.

'This is circular economy, and this is the way to stand up to what's important in the way we do business. It's very responsible and a very relevant initiative,' said JV Emmanuel De Dios, Manila Water president and CEO.

Cemex Philippines has been offering co-processing as a reliable and efficient waste management solution. Currently, there are more than 30 local government units and corporations working together with Cemex in pursuing innovative and effective waste management system in the Philippines. These partnerships have helped reduce wastes that end up in landfills or bodies of water.

The partnership with water and wastewater service provider Manila Water will utilize the co-processing technology of Cemex which has demonstrated to be a proven sustainable waste disposal solution recognized by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR).

'An initial 10 metric tons of dried biosolids has been delivered from our Makati South Sewage Treatment Plant to the Cemex Antipolo Plant, which we hope to scale up very soon,' said Donna Cabalona-Perez, Manila Water's head of wastewater operations.

'As pioneers in the country of biosolids as alternative fuels, we have just signed what will now create the series of significant steps towards making circular economy a reality,' said Christer Gaudiano, Cemex Philippines' sustainability and public affairs director.

The co-processing technology involves the use of a cement kiln, a furnace operating at extremely hot temperatures of around 1,500 degrees Celsius that guarantees the complete breakdown of waste and toxic substances. The technology eliminates residual waste, eventually reducing landfill space in the long-term.

Christer Gaudiano, ERM, Communications and Public Affairs Director.

Partners of CEMEX have expressed the positive impact of the waste management initiative in their respective localities.

“Malaki talaga ang tulong ng CEMEX kasi 2016 pa partner na kami ni CEMEX. Malaki talaga yung reduction. Of course, na-meet naming yung goal ng waste diversion ng DENR,” said Engr. Maria Lourdes San Miguel, MENRO designate and GSO of Sta. Cruz, Laguna.

(CEMEX is really helping us a lot because we have been a partner of CEMEX since 2016. It’s a really big help in terms of (waste) reduction. Of course, we were able to meet our waste diversion goal’ said Engr. Maria Lourdes San Miguel, MENRO designate and GSO of Sta. Cruz, Laguna.)

“Ito ay isang malaking tulong para sa aming pamahalaang bayan dahil sa halip na itapon pa ito sa disposal shed, ngayon naiipon namin at nadadala namin sa CEMEX, at nakakatulong kami sa pamamagitan ng alternative technology na ipinagkaloob sa amin ng CEMEX,” added Ms. Reynesiba Corpuz, NDRRMO designated member.

(‘This is really a big help for our municipal government because instead of dumping wastes to our disposal shed, we are able to collect and bring them to CEMEX, and we are able to help in the alternative technology given to us by CEMEX, added Ms. Reynesiba Corpuz, NDRRMO designated member.)

Additionally, during the EMB Region 4B Environmental Summit 2022 organized by the Environmental Management Bureau (DENR-EMB-Mimaropa), CEMEX Philippines showcased its best practices in initiating the green movement towards responsible consumption and waste diversion. The two-day forum provided a platform for local government units in the MIMAROPA region to discuss relevant topics on improving environmental quality, particularly ecological solid waste management.

Meanwhile in Cebu, CEMEX Philippines participated in the Clean Air Exhibit as part of the Clean Air Month culmination activity of the Environmental Management Bureau – Region 7 (DENR-EMB-7). The CEMEX booth highlighted air quality management, climate action strategies such as carbon footprint reduction and climate change mitigation, and the company’s contributions and best practices in environmental protection. This includes the company’s co-processing technology, which is an environmental process that involves turning qualified solid waste into alternative fuels, reducing greenhouse gas emissions by replacing fossil fuels.

“This exhibit is a way for the company to enhance public awareness about our environmental actions and best practices for maintaining the air quality standards in the area where we operate,” said Jenevy Patalingjug, Environmental Manager, APO Cement. “We want to share to the public how we protect the environment, care for our employees and upbuild our communities,” Patalingjug added.

All of these efforts are part of CEMEX’s “Future in Action” strategy which aims for the company to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 35 percent by 2025 and 40 percent by 2030, with the ultimate goal of becoming a net-zero CO2 company by 2050.

The City of Tayabas and the towns of Atimonan, Candelaria, Mauban, Mulanay and Tiaong received special recognition from CEMEX Philippines, in acknowledgment of their residual plastic wastes footprint reduction through co-processing. The awarding was held during the meeting of the Quezon Province Solid Waste Management Board and the Province’s League of Local Environment and Natural Resources Officers in Tayabas City, Quezon.

The six localities in Quezon have been helping CEMEX Philippines address the country’s waste management problem through proper waste segregation, collection, treatment and co-processing. Since 2021, more than 360,000 kgs of residual waste have been collected from the Province, and CEMEX expects to gather more with additional potential partner LGUs in the Province.

CEMEX Philippines continues to strengthen multisectoral partnerships and aims to add more to the growing list of LGUs in the achievement of plastic neutrality, carbon footprint reduction and contribute to a more circular economy.

“We have been a partner of CEMEX for almost three years already and CEMEX has been a big help to our municipality as it brought us a lot of savings in our solid waste management,” shares Joelda Tadeja, Municipal Environment Officer of Mulanay, Quezon and President of Quezon Province’s League of Local Environment and Natural Resources Officers.

Through a memorandum of understanding, CEMEX and these cities and municipalities in the Province of Quezon are working together towards proper segregation, collection of qualified residual plastic wastes generated from their respective areas, which are transported to CEMEX’s Solid Cement Plant in Antipolo City for treatment and co-processing. Supported by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), co-processing is a proven sustainable way of disposing plastic waste by diverting and utilizing them during the cement manufacturing process.

“Ever since we had a partnership with CEMEX, segregation has been really implemented and the diversion of our residual plastic wastes allowed us to extend the life of our sanitary landfill. Because of our partnership, a lot of people were encouraged to segregate and our LGU implemented more programs about waste management,” says Ryan B. De Luna, Municipal Environment Officer of Candelaria, Quezon.

The Philippines is one of the largest plastic waste contributors in the world. A 2021 World Bank study estimates that over 163 million pieces of sachets are consumed every day and 2.7 million tons of plastic waste are generated in the Philippines each year, around 20 percent of which ends up in the ocean.

“Indeed, plastic waste management is one of our biggest challenges in the country, and we must act together to address this problem” says Atty. Christer Gaudiano, Director for ERM, Corporate Communications & Public Affairs at CEMEX Philippines.

“We are proud with our long and steady partnerships in Quezon Province, and we are happy that we are able to support various local governments in the country to address plastic waste management. Through innovative means, we can divert residual plastic wastes and integrate them into our cement manufacturing operations as alternative energy sources,” Atty. Gaudiano adds.

To date, a total of 25 LGUs are already co-processing their residual wastes with CEMEX, and over two dozen partners are in the pipeline as more LGUs realize the benefits of co-processing and how it helps them regulate and manage waste in their respective cities or municipalities.

These sustainability efforts are all aligned with CEMEX’s Future in Action agenda, the company’s global strategy to help mitigate the impact of climate change by reducing CO2 emissions by 35% by 2025 and by more than 40% by 2030, with the ultimate goal of becoming a net-zero CO2 company by 2050.

CEMEX Philippines asserts its commitment to a better future through building a multibillion-peso new integrated cement line in its Solid Cement Plant in Antipolo City, Rizal.

In building the facility, the company increases Solid Cement’s current annual capacity by 1.5 million tons, bringing the total output to 3.4 million tons, and positions itself to supply more for the nation’s infrastructure programs and building needs.

CEMEX Philippines is investing $356 million (about P16.15 billion) in the new integrated cement line located in its 42-ha Solid Cement Plant property.

CEMEX Philippines President and CEO Luis Franco said that “this expansion project will not only meet infrastructure needs, but will also increase the growth and development opportunities in the communities and in the country.”

“We will maintain our active role in supporting the development of this nation as we have done in the past 25 years, and I am confident that we will continue to do so through collaboration and partnership,” Franco added.

Civil works for silos and mechanical installation have been ongoing, already with an investment of $197 million as of March 2022.

The company’s contractors are expected to complete building the whole facility by March 2024, fitted out with resource-efficient features like technologies to reuse waste hot gases for drying raw materials and a bag filter system that will improve dust emission control far below the actual regulation. Also prioritizing the environment, the cement line will include a proprietary solution called Low Temperature Clinker. CEMEX Philippines expects its new line to start commercial operations by April 2024.

CEMEX proves itself a leader in the construction materials industry by introducing low carbon, eco-friendly products to the Philippines.

The company’s passion for sustainability is seen in the utilization of eco-friendly and low-carbon Vertua products in the project. Vertua, the new-generation cement recently launched by the company, is high-quality and environment-friendly with 15-40 percent lower carbon footprint than the traditional Portland cement.

The new cement line is using an estimated 6,000 tons of Vertua cement products. This is equivalent to 564 metric tons of CO2 reduction, 121 gasoline-powered passenger vehicles off the road for a year or 9,321 tree seedlings grown for 10 years.

Vertua, like the new line at the Solid Cement Plant, reflects CEMEX’s green commitment. Globally launched in 2020, Vertua is an extensive portfolio that includes lower-carbon cements, concrete, as well as aggregates and admixtures.

On the path to zero-carbon status by 2050, it is guided by “Future in Action,” a CEMEX global agenda focused on implementing aggressive decarbonization goals encompassing lower-carbon products, solutions and processes.

Globally, the cement industry generates 5-8 percent of the world’s CO2 emissions, said the Global Cement and Concrete Association (GCCA). Cement, after all, is the second most consumed material in the world.

“A sustainable future drives our actions today. This means putting our focus on reducing our carbon footprint across our operations and transforming the cement industry value chain,” Franco highlighted.

All this is part of CEMEX’s solid commitment to transform into a carbon-neutral company, building a better future and addressing humanity’s most pressing issue: climate change.

“Co-processing is one of our climate-smart solutions that we employ in our operations. It is an effective means to divert plastic and other residual wastes away from municipal landfills and integrate them efficiently into our cement-manufacturing process, resulting to complete breakdown of waste and toxic substances,” explains Atty. Christer Gaudiano, CEMEX Director for Enterprise Risk Management, Corporate Communications and Public Affairs.

Currently, CEMEX has at least 30 local government unit partners across the country to co-process a portion of their municipal wastes, which are transported to CEMEX plants, such as the Solid Cement Plant in Antipolo, Rizal and the APO Cement Plant in Naga, Cebu.

From January to July 2022, CEMEX facilities have already co-processed solid wastes equivalent to 27 days’ worth of waste in Metro Cebu.

CEMEX recognizes the importance of a multi-sectoral approach in solving the country’s problem on waste management and plans to expand its waste management partnerships to more LGUs and even the private sector to broaden this cause.

CEMEX’s climate-smart actions are in line with its Future in Action agenda, a global strategy which focuses on reducing CO2 emissions by more than 40% by 2030 and with the ultimate goal of becoming a net-zero CO2 company by 2050.

14 December 2022

CEMEX has announced the launch in Colombia of its first Circularity Center worldwide. The site is located south of Bogotá in an old quarry that has been restored recently and will become a model for other CEMEX operations.

The 300ha property, located in the Tunjuelo sector, was used for more than 70 years as a source of building materials for the growth of Bogotá. By having excavations more than 50m deep, the land has been used in recent years as the primary recipient of demolition waste in the capital, allowing its ecological rehabilitation and the subsequent planting of a vegetative layer.

CEMEX’s next action at the site as part of its CEMEX's Future in Action programme will see:

1. closure of quarry activities in the location

2. recycling used cement bags to avoid their final disposal in landfills. The cellulose extracted from the bags is used for construction materials

3. solid waste collection to replace fossil fuel to produce the company's building materials portfolio

4. collecting and crushing demolition waste for reuse in recycled aggregates

5. reception and activation of excavation waste

6. planning future urban projects in one of the most densely populated areas of the city in coordination with the Bogotá Mayor's Office.

""This is a pioneering model for CEMEX in the construction materials industry globally, which we aim to position as a benchmark for circularity within the sustainable development of large cities in Colombia and the world,"" said Alejandro Ramírez, president of CEMEX in Colombia and Peru.

Cemex is therefore partnering with VeryNile’s project for the collection and recycling of solid waste around the western bank of the Nile in Assiut.

This governorate, with a population of 4.2 million, is made up of the towns of Assiut, Abnub, Abou Tig, Daïrout, El Badari and Manfalout, where industrial activities contribute to the pollution of the 6,671-kilometre-long river. In a context marked by water stress and illegal fishing in Egypt, the eco-responsible initiative of VeryNile and Cemex’s Egyptian subsidiary should enable the development of the circular economy through sustainable waste management.

“Just like our first Nile clean-up operation (in July 2022) in the governorates of Cairo and Giza, we will use the non-recyclable and non-hazardous fraction of the waste collected from our kilns to achieve carbon neutrality in landfills. This is an alternative to fossil fuels and natural raw materials,” explains Fernando Gonzalez, Cemex’s president for the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Egypt.

At the same time, the authorities in the North African country have begun construction of 31 recycling plants, including a “solid waste management complex” in the 10 Ramadan industrial zone near Cairo, as well as a controlled landfill that will facilitate the sorting and recovery of household waste in the governorate of Qalyubiya. These facilities, eight of which will be delivered by June 2023, will help reduce urban waste pollution.

Fossil fuels are typically used to heat the kiln, with Cemex saying they are responsible for about 40 percent of the process’s direct carbon dioxide emissions.

“The production of the first solar clinker is an exciting milestone for this transformational technology,” says Fernando Gonzalez, CEO of Cemex. “It is proof of our commitment to deliver tangible outcomes through innovation to achieve our goal of delivering only net-zero CO2 concrete by 2050.”

The project

The Cemex and Synhelion R&D teams set up a pilot batch production unit to produce clinker from concentrated solar radiation by connecting the clinker production process with the Synhelion solar receiver, according to Cemex. The pilot was installed at the Very High Concentration Solar Tower of IMDEA Energy in Spain.

Synhelion’s solar receiver delivers the extreme temperatures. The solar receiver heats a gaseous heat transfer fluid and, thus, provides the necessary process heat for clinker production.

“Our technology converts concentrated sunlight into the hottest existing solar process heat – beyond 1,500 degrees [Celsius] – on the market,” says Gianluca Ambrosetti, CEO and co-founder of Synhelion. “We are proud to demonstrate together with Cemex one specific industrially relevant application of our fully renewable, high-temperature solar heat.”

Cemex says the clinker was used to produce cement and was then further processed to produce concrete.

In the next phase of their joint research and development project, Cemex and Synhelion aim to produce solar clinker in larger quantities as they work toward an industrial-scale pilot at a cement plant.","Cemex, Synhelion produce clinker with solar heat"

01 March 2023

The CEMEX and VeryNile initiative have expanded the scope of the partnership to reach the CEMEX Egypt's hometown of Assiut. This comes after the success achieved by their partnership in cleaning the Nile River from plastic waste in Cairo and Giza governorates.



The expansion process included contracting a group from the local fishing community from Assiut who collected four loaded trucks of plastic waste from the Nile during their first month. Following the waste hierarchy, CEMEX will use the non-recyclable, non-hazardous fraction of the waste collected as alternative fuel in its kilns in efforts to reach zero waste to landfills.

The initiative and its expansion come as part of CEMEX efforts to support circular economy as part of its global business for providing circularity solutions, ""Regenera"" – including the receiving, managing, recycling and recovering of waste. Regenera supports the ambition to use more non-recyclable waste and industrial by-products as a more sustainable alternative to fossil fuels and natural raw materials.

CEMEX and VeryNile signed a cooperation protocol in June of last year, to expand the scope of the initiative’s operations in collecting waste from the Nile and support the fishing community of Qursaya Island. Since then, CEMEX has received around 40t of waste collected from the Nile that was used as alternative fuel as part of the company's actions to support circular economy.

“At CEMEX, we work on building a more sustainable future in line with our climate-action programme “Future in Action”. Since we started working with VeryNile, we wanted to expand the initiative to Assiut, and we are delighted to see the initiative taking off in our second year of cooperation”, commented Carlos Gonzalez, CEMEX Egypt and UAE president.

Building materials supplier CEMEX is helping to meet growing customer demand for its products by adding ten new lower emission tippers to its own fleet, which boast upgraded safety features, a higher payload for increased efficiency and a step change in decarbonisation of its delivery fleet.

The new Volvo FM 460 8x4 tippers, which will feature CEMEX’s Future in Action branding, will work out of CEMEX’s depot in Angerstein and be used to deliver aggregates and sand to construction sites across the capital.

Thanks to their lightweight aluminium body, the business will be able to increase the amount of material transported in each load, while the engine meets the Euro 6 exhaust emissions requirements, which reduces nitrogen oxide (NOX) by 80% and particulate emissions by 50% compared with Euro 5.

By investing in more efficient, more sustainable vehicles CEMEX demonstrates again its commitment to decarbonisation of all aspects of its operations, and the management of its logistics fleet is central to this.

These vehicles all meet Transport for London’s Direct Vision Standard rating, thanks to their enhanced safety features. These include a side-scan system, while visual alerts are displayed on the windscreen if something is moving into the vehicle’s danger zone.

Furthermore, each truck’s cab features raised A-pillars that give it up to one extra cubic metre of space and more light. A large windscreen, low door line and modern mirrors ensures excellent all-round visibility which is improved further with an added lower window on each passenger door.

Nigel Ponton, Fleet Engineering Manager for CEMEX UK, said: “The addition of these new trucks to our fleet will enable us to better meet customer demand, safely and efficiently. Safety is the number one focus whenever we add new trucks to our operation and these Volvos tick every box in that respect.

""One of the reasons why these vehicles stood out for CEMEX was because of the improved visibility and layout of the day cabs – providing an ideal workplace for our drivers whilst aiding the safety of other road users.

“These trucks will all be working in busy streets across London so it’s imperative we provide our drivers with the best tools possible to do the job and help protect any vulnerable road users. Moreover, thanks to the improved fuel efficiencies and enhanced payload these new Volvos are the most sustainable vehicles we’ve ever had and will help decarbonise our delivery footprint.”",CEMEX expands logistics fleet with ten new lower emission tippers

CEMEX has also committed to reduce its indirect electricity GHG emissions (scope 2) by 42% by 2030 from a 2020 base year.

“Climate action is the biggest challenge of our times. CEMEX is taking decisive action to address it by defining ambitious emissions reduction targets in line with the Science Based Targets initiative and executing against those targets,” said Fernando A. Gonzalez, CEO of CEMEX. “We commit to continue leading the industry in climate action not only because it creates value, but more importantly because it is the right thing to do. CEMEX is building a better future, and that future must be sustainable.”

Under its Future in Action program, CEMEX announced a climate action target of below 475 kg CO 2 , a >40% reduction in CO 2 emissions by 2030. The company´s clean electricity consumption will also increase from the current 29% in 2020 to 55% by 2030.

The site is located south of Bogotá in an old quarry that has been restored recently and will become a model for other CEMEX operations. The Circularity Center covers 300 hectares south of Bogotá and was used as a source of building materials and a place to dispose of demolition waste for 70 years.

CEMEX has reformed the land and is working on its ecological restoration to create an exemplary mine closure that will contribute to the city.

The project is aligned with local initiatives to encourage circular waste management and promote a sustainable habitat in Bogotá.

The 300-hectare property, located in the Tunjuelo sector, was used for more than 70 years as a source of building materials for the growth of Bogotá. By having excavations more than 50 m deep, the land has been used in recent years as the primary recipient of demolition waste in the capital, allowing its ecological rehabilitation and the subsequent planting of a vegetal layer.

The CEMEX Circularity Center in Tunjuelo comprises six components focused on reducing CO 2 emissions as part of CEMEX's Future in Action program:

Closure of quarry activities in the location.

Recycling used cement bags to avoid their final disposal in landfills; the cellulose extracted from the bags is used for construction materials.

Solid waste collection to replace fossil fuel to produce the company's building materials portfolio.

Collecting and crushing demolition waste for reuse in recycled aggregates.

Reception and activation of excavation waste.

Planning future urban projects in one of the most densely populated areas of the city in coordination with the Bogotá Mayor's Office.

(«CEMEX») announced today that the U.S. Department of Energy awarded US$3.2 million to Solar MEAD, a joint project headed by CEMEX, Sandia National Laboratories, and Synhelion, which aims to decarbonize cement production.

Solar MEAD aims to replace the use of fossil fuels with concentrated solar thermal (“CST”) energy in clinker production, the key component in cement. CEMEX and Synhelion have been collaborating to introduce CST in the cement production process, achieving the first successful laboratory-scale demonstrative pilot in 2022 by producing the first-ever solar clinker. Sandia Laboratories will contribute unique research facilities as part of the National Solar Thermal Test Facility, and subject matter expertise to help accelerate the adaptation of the technology to cement manufacturing.

Synhelion’s breakthrough technology delivers high-temperature process heat beyond 1,500 degrees Celsius – sufficient heat to produce clinker without using fossil fuels.

«Cement produced with solar energy is an exciting technology with tremendous potential to reduce the carbon footprint of cement production,» said Fernando A. González, CEO of CEMEX. «Achieving our net zero carbon goal by 2050 will require relentless innovation such as this to discover and scale breakthrough technologies.» Close-up of Synhelion’s solar receiver, which provides the necessary process heat to decarbonize clinker production.

«Few renewable technologies are capable of generating heat at the temperatures needed to process raw cement feedstock,» said Nathan Schroeder, Sandia researcher and principal investigator for the Solar MEAD project. «This project will advance our understanding of how to use concentrating solar technology to gather and deliver the heat to existing cement production facilities and will have crosscutting relevance to other ore processing industries such as refractory, ceramics, and battery production.»

Gianluca Ambrosetti, CEO and Co-Founder of Synhelion, added: «The project offers us the opportunity to use our sustainable technology to support the decarbonization of energy-intensive cement clinker production. This solution can have a huge impact on the industry and will help to pave the way towards net-zero. We are proud of contributing to this goal.»

The project will investigate methods to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, lower process temperatures, and increase the efficiency of clinker formation using solar energy. The team will assess the conditions to maximize heat transfer to the raw cement mix.

Successful adoption of this technology in cement manufacturing will not only allow for 100% replacement of fossil fuels but also result in a more efficient and lower-cost carbon capture process when compared to the current state-of-the-art technologies.

Clinker is produced by fusing limestone, clay, and other materials in a rotary kiln at temperatures nearing 1,500°C. Fossil fuels are typically used to heat the kiln and are responsible for approximately 40% of the direct CO 2 emissions of the process. Replacing fossil fuels entirely with solar energy is a game-changer in the industry’s efforts to achieve carbon neutrality.

Sandia National Laboratories is a multimission laboratory operated by National Technology and Engineering Solutions of Sandia LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Honeywell International Inc., for the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Nuclear Security Administration. Sandia Labs has major research and development responsibilities in nuclear deterrence, global security, defense, energy technologies and economic competitiveness, with main facilities in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and Livermore, California.

Synhelion is a global pioneer in the field of carbon-neutral solar fuels. The clean energy company evolved from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH Zurich) in 2016 to decarbonize the transportation sector. Synhelion is currently building its first industrial solar fuel plant in Germany. The first commercial production facility is planned for commissioning in Spain by 2025. Synhelion is the first company to sustainably generate process heat beyond 1,500°C with concentrated solar radiation. This makes it possible to drive industrial processes such as fuel production and cement manufacturing with solar heat for the first time. The company provides the world with cutting-edge technology to help solve the climate crisis and works with international partners such as Eni, CEMEX, Lufthansa Group, Swiss International Air Lines, SMS group, Wood, AMAG Group, and Zurich Airport.

This acquisition is part of CEMEX's Future in Action programme, aimed at achieving carbon neutrality.

“With this acquisition, at CEMEX, we are firmly committed to the circular economy by integrating our value chain to the production of climate-friendly fuels that we use in cement production. Our objective for this year is to double Broquer’s capacity and thereby contribute to the progress towards sustainability in the city of Queretaro, as well as the transformation of Mexico towards a green economy,” said Ricardo Naya, President of CEMEX Mexico.

All waste processed at the Broquers plant will be used as a climate-friendly fuel to power CEMEX's operations in Mexico; CEMEX takes advantage of the energy generated from the processed waste to use in its plants. Thanks to this process, CO 2 emissions into the atmosphere are reduced by replacing fossil fuels, one of the most significant contributors to global warming.

Last year, CEMEX harnessed the energy of more than 500 000 tons of waste to power its operations in Mexico, avoiding the emission of more than 730 000 tons of CO 2 per year or the equivalent of planting 12 million trees. Broquers expects to increase the current staff by 50 new employees this year to expand its processing capacity.

Broquers was the first plant of its kind in Mexico to have sophisticated waste separation equipment in line with European standards for waste treatment. This results in a fast, highly efficient, and safe industrial process that solves the challenge of Queretaro’s municipal waste in a local, sustainable, and environmentally friendly way.

Broquers will continue to operate ordinarily and comply, as before, with all the conditions stipulated in its concession title for the treatment of urban solid waste in the municipality of Queretaro.

It has tested a process that converts flue gases emitted by a cement kiln into the carbon nanomaterials, thereby transforming ‘bad’ carbon into ‘good’ carbon.

Cemex is exploring and evaluating different applications of carbon nanomaterials to develop cement-based materials with novel and advanced performance, such as mechanical, chemical resistance, or thermal and electrical properties. Reintroducing CO 2 emissions in the construction value chain would boost the industry’s contribution to the circular economy, said Cemex.

The mechanical, thermal, electrical and chemical properties of carbon nanomaterials mean that they have potential applications in a wide array of industries. Nanomaterials include high-tech materials such as nanofibres, nanotubes, graphene and carbon black that have applications in areas including the electronics, automotive, agriculture, chemical, pharmaceuticals and textile sectors as well as construction.

The technology was born out of Smart Innovation, Cemex’s internal open innovation platform, and was one of the winners of the 2019 innovation competition. Cemex’s research and development team continued to develop the concept and has recently achieved promising results, with a carbon conversion rate of 50% in a lab setting. The next step is to scale the technology in a cement plant pilot within a year.

“This breakthrough technology is significant for Cemex, not only because it offers the potential to commercialise carbon emissions, but because it demonstrates the value of our Smart Innovation platform,” said Fernando A Gonzalez, CEO of Cemex. “The path to carbon neutrality will be built with innovation, and we remain committed to being at the forefront in developing new circular technologies and processes.”

CEMEX has joined a consortium that will combine hydrogen and CO2 into sustainable fuel for the aviation industry.

CEMEX, S.A.B. de C.V. (“CEMEX”) continues its path to a net-zero future by joining forces with integrated chemicals and energy company Sasol ecoFT and renewable energy company ENERTRAG in a milestone project that will combine CO 2 with hydrogen to produce sustainable aviation fuel.

This project is part of CEMEX’s Future in Action program to reduce its carbon footprint and contribute to a circular economy and an integral component of CEMEX’s master plan to develop a carbon neutral operation at its Rüdersdorf cement plant by 2030.

The consortium will source green hydrogen generated exclusively from wind and solar energy from ENERTRAG. The CO 2 will come from CEMEX’s Rüdersdorf cement plant in Germany, which will provide 100 tons of CO 2 per day in the project’s initial stages.

Sasol ecoFT will then contribute its innovative technology to produce e-kerosene, which, once certified, can be blended to constitute up to 50% of jet fuel.

Fernando A. Gonzalez, CEO of CEMEX, said:

We are excited to be part of this groundbreaking project that will contribute to the decarbonization of two of the world’s key industries.

“The path to carbon neutrality will be built with innovation, and we remain committed to being at the forefront in developing new circular technologies and processes.”

Sixty per cent of the carbon emissions in the cement production process come from the chemical reaction that occurs in cement kilns. To reach carbon neutrality, these emissions must be captured, stored, or repurposed in some way.

CEMEX is leading the way in these technologies through partnerships with other industries, the work of its R&D center, and investments from its venture capital arm, CEMEX Ventures. Thanks for staying up to date with Hydrogen Central.

The Rüdersdorf carbon neutral alliance includes over 20 startups, universities, companies from other industries, and authorities working to develop industrial-scale solutions using leading-edge technologies to achieve the first carbon-neutral cement plant in the world.

The ReadyBlock Zero is a zero-carbon equivalent to the conventional construction material, which is characterised in accordance with The CarbonNeutral Protocol. The product is part of the company’s VERTUSA line of Urbanisation Solutions that are expected to be more sustainable than conventional concrete.



While the product may look like an ordinary block, it holds 80% less embodied carbon and reaches net zero through 20% carbon offsets. The company works with Natural Capital Partners, a London-based organisation that specialises in carbon neutrality and financial services.

Why add zero-carbon concrete to its range?

Similar to other industries, the construction sector is undergoing rigorous legislative changes to ensure that building standards are sustainable in terms of their waste management and contribution to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.



The industry foresees changes to laws to include one that will govern the level of embodied carbon and emissions — the government’s Future Home Standard —, which will ensure that new homes will produce low to no carbon emissions and the target is set to a 75 to 80% reduction by 2025. By June 2022, new home builders are expected to reduce CO2 by around 30% and CEMEX’s low-carbon block is a catalyst in achieving that.



‘We have developed the UK’s first CarbonNeutral® concrete block to help housebuilders get ahead of the game when it comes to building low carbon homes that meet and exceed Government guidelines and changes to building regulations’, says Carl Platt, Urbanisation Solutions Director of Asphalt, Paving and Building Products for Europe. ‘We want to make life easier for housebuilders to make simple sustainable choices that make largescale impacts on the often complex road to net zero. Concrete blocks are the most common structural component in the construction of UK homes, so by switching to zero carbon blocks, ReadyBlock Zero presents a huge opportunity for housebuilders to make significant carbon reductions’.

Sustainability inspired acquisition for waste management

On the 27th of January, it was also announced that CEMEX has acquired a sustainable company to take care of its waste management actions. Broquers Ambiental will focus on the separation, recovery and treatment of waste generated by urban construction projects in the city of Querétaro, Mexico.



The waste produced by the Broquers plant will be put back into operations in Mexico in the form of climate-friendly fuel. This process allows CEMEX to replace fossil fuels with a more sustainably-sourced product. In 2021, the company utilised more than 500,000 tonnes-worth of waste to power Mexican operations, which is equivalent to more than 730,000 tonnes of annual CO2 equivalent that would be achieved by planting 12 million trees.

In a statement on Tuesday, Cemex said it now co-processes six kilograms of waste for every kilogram it generates. From 2016 to 2020, it was able to co-process 214,772 tons of waste compared to the waste generated by its cement facilities at 35,850 tons for the same period.

“Co-processing more than the waste we generate is proof-positive of our solid commitment in ensuring we are drivers of the circular economy, helping increase the use of waste as alternative fuels, reducing greenhouse gas emissions as these wastes provide replacement for fossil fuels,” Cemex President and Chief Executive Officer Ignacio Alejandro Mijares Elizondo said.

In a statement last year, Cemex said its co-processing procedure involves taking the plastic and rubber-based parts of waste materials, which will then undergo a pre-treatment process before being used to manufacture cement.

Meanwhile, the non-recyclable waste is converted into “usable heat to help power the cement kiln.”

“Co-processing helps divert these wastes which otherwise would end up in landfills and waterways,” Mr. Mijares said in the statement on Tuesday.

With the 214,772 tons of waste co-processed within the 2016 to 2020 period, the company said it was able to avoid 327,742 tons of CO 2 emissions. That translates to cutting emissions produced by 71,278 passenger vehicles in a year or 362,248 tons of coal burned.

In 2020, global Cemex said 91% of its plants collectively co-processed 2.7 million tons of waste to alternative fuels, which is equivalent to a 25.3% substitution rate and 1.6 million tons of coal replaced.

“We take earnest steps in making sure that we maximize environmental opportunities in our operations, including [the] use of alternative fuels through co-processing,” Mr. Mijares said.

The company has a “Future in Action” agenda that focuses on addressing climate change via cutting down CO 2 emissions by 35% and aims to reduce its emissions by 40% come 2030. The company hopes to invest $60 million every year for the program.

Cemex is also trying to improve its production efficiency as part of its climate action initiatives, such as investing in energy efficiency, using alternative fuels, expanding its use of renewable energy, and increasing its use of clinker substitution.

On Tuesday, shares of Cemex Holdings went up 0.93% or one centavo to close at P1.08 apiece. — Keren Concepcion G. Valmonte",Cemex says co-processing boosts climate initiatives

This comes after the success achieved by their partnership in cleaning the Nile River from plastic waste in Cairo and Giza governorates. The expansion process included contracting a group from the local fishing community from Assiut who collected 4 loaded trucks of plastic waste from the Nile during their first month. Following the waste hierarchy, CEMEX will use the non-recyclable, non-hazardous fraction of the waste collected as Alternative fuel in its kilns in efforts to reach zero waste to landfills.

The initiative and its expansion come as part of CEMEX efforts to support circular economy as part of its global business for providing circularity solutions, ""Regenera"" – including the receiving, managing, recycling and recovering of waste. Regenera supports the ambition to use more non-recyclable waste and industrial by-products as a more sustainable alternative to fossil fuels and natural raw materials.

CEMEX and VeryNile signed a cooperation protocol in June of last year, to expand the scope of the initiative’s operations in collecting waste from the Nile and support the fishing community of Qursaya Island. Since then, CEMEX has received around 40 t of waste collected from the Nile that was used as alternative fuel as part of the company's actions to support circular economy.

“At CEMEX, we work on building a more sustainable future in line with our climate-action program “Future in Action”. Since we started working with VeryNile, we wanted to expand the initiative to Assiut, and we are delighted to see the initiative taking off in our second year of cooperation”, commented Carlos Gonzalez, CEMEX Egypt & UAE President.

Mr. Alban de Ménonville, Managing Director of VeryNile, commented on expanding the scope of the initiative's operations in Assiut, ""This first replication of our model opens the doors to a complete new scope of action. We are now able to support local communities everywhere on the Nile, through applying the same model we have developed in Cairo. In the near future we can potentially empower thousands of the fishing community to work for a cleaner Nile. ""

CEMEX has successfully converted CO2 into carbon nanomaterials in a laboratory setting. It is the first company in the cement industry to introduce this technology, which could be a game-changer in decarbonizing cement production.

MONTERREY, Mexico--(BUSINESS WIRE)--CEMEX, S.A.B. de C.V. (“CEMEX”) announced today that it has successfully tested a process that converts flue gases emitted by the cement kiln into carbon nanomaterials, thereby transforming ""bad"" carbon into ""good"" carbon. Due to their unique mechanical, thermal, electrical, and chemical properties, carbon nanomaterials have several potential applications in a wide array of industries, from construction to biomedicine.

This technology was born out of Smart Innovation, CEMEX’s internal open innovation platform, and was one of the winners of the 2019 innovation competition. CEMEX’s Research and Development area continued to develop the concept. Recently, the team has achieved promising results, a carbon conversion rate of 50%, in a lab setting. The next step is to scale the technology in a cement plant pilot within a year. A key pillar of CEMEX’s flagship decarbonization program, Future in Action, is discovering and investing in scalable technologies and innovations to achieve carbon neutrality.

“This breakthrough technology is significant for CEMEX, not only because it offers the potential to commercialize carbon emissions, but because it demonstrates the value of our Smart Innovation platform,” said Fernando A. Gonzalez, CEO of CEMEX. “The path to carbon neutrality will be built with innovation, and we remain committed to being at the forefront in developing new circular technologies and processes.”

Nanomaterials include high-tech materials such as nanofibers, nanotubes, graphene and carbon black, that have applications in several industries including electronics, automotive, refractory ceramics, agriculture, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, textile, and construction materials. Thus, the proposed technology can turn CO 2 emissions into a value-added product, achieving a circular process that is key to sustainable development.

CEMEX is exploring and evaluating different applications of carbon nanomaterials to develop cement-based materials with novel and advanced performance, such as mechanical, chemical resistance, or thermal and electrical properties. The novel properties also enhance the sustainable attributes of cement-based materials as the same CO 2 emitted is used to improve the performance. Reintroducing CO 2 emissions in the construction value chain would boost the industry’s contribution to the circular economy.
