report,unilever,6 Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2021 2021 was another turbulent year for the world economy and for global markets.,20
report,unilever,"Output rebounded strongly, if unevenly, after the sharp Covid-related declines of 2020.",12
report,unilever,"However, surging demand, triggered by significant fiscal and monetary stimulus, gave rise to widespread labour shortages, supply bottlenecks and soaring energy costs, stoking significant inflationary pressures.",26
report,unilever,"For Unilever, this steep rise in input cost inflation was one of the defining features of the year, impacting each of our product categories.",24
report,unilever,"Against this challenging backdrop, we delivered a strong set of results in 2021.",13
report,unilever,"Underlying sales growth of 4.5% represented Unilever's fastest growth in nine years, well into the upper end of our 3-5% multi-year framework.",22
report,unilever,"We responded to rising input costs with pricing actions, delivering underlying price growth of 2.9% for the year.",18
report,unilever,"While never easy, raising customer prices in response to inflationary pressures is vital and necessary if we are to preserve our ability to invest in Unilever's brands.",27
report,unilever,Underlying volume growth for the full year was 1.6%.,9
report,unilever,"Growth was broad-based, with each of our three global Divisions Beauty & Personal Care, Foods & Refreshment and Home Care performing well.",22
report,unilever,"We ended the year with 53% of the business winning market share by value, a second consecutive year of competitive growth and a marked improvement in our competitive performance from just a few years ago.",35
report,unilever,"While top-line growth remains the number one priority, margin progression is also an important component of value creation.",18
report,unilever,"Underlying operating margin for the year was 18.4%, down 10bps on the previous year.",14
report,unilever,"Although pricing stepped up, it wasn't enough to fully offset the impact of inflation across our raw materials, packaging and distribution costs.",22
report,unilever,"Free Cash Flow remained strong at 6.4 billion, albeit down versus a record delivery in 2020, when the business was focused on delivering cash in a period of huge uncertainty.",30
report,unilever,"For 2021, we declared a 3% increase to the fullyear dividend, taking the dividend for the year to 4.5 billion.",20
report,unilever,"Overall, we made good progress in 2021.",7
report,unilever,We stepped up pricing significantly in a heavily inflationary environment while delivering strong earnings and maintaining our restored competitiveness.,19
report,unilever,One of the most encouraging aspects of our growth in 2021 was the extent to which it followed the five Compass strategic choices we called out a year ago.,29
report,unilever,These choices sit at the heart of our strategy for value creation see pages 8 to 9.,17
report,unilever,"The first of these is winning with brands and innovation, ensuring that our top brands deliver superior performance.",18
report,unilever,"Today, we have 13 brands with sales in excess of 1 billion.",12
report,unilever,Together they make up over half of our total turnover.,10
report,unilever,"Last year, they grew in aggregate by 6.4%.",8
report,unilever,This included some particularly strong individual performances.,7
report,unilever,"Dove, for example, grew by 8%, its best performance in eight years; Hellmann's grew 11%; and our Ice Cream brands Magnum and Ben & Jerry's each grew 7%.",28
report,unilever,Behind the success of these brands is product superiority and great innovation and we continue to step up our performance in both areas.,23
report,unilever,"Product superiority in tests versus Unilever's competition is now over 70% of tested turnover, up from less than 50% in 2019, and our focus on driving bigger, better and more impactful innovation delivered over 1 billion of incremental turnover in 2021, double the delivery in 2020.",46
report,unilever,It is no surprise or coincidence that our top-performing brands also happen to be those with the most clearly defined and powerfully articulated commitment to purpose as a driver of brand growth.,32
report,unilever,"As well as focusing on winning with our biggest and strongest brands, we have also chosen to prioritise investment in the key growth markets for the future, including most notably the US, India and China.",35
report,unilever,All three countries delivered strong and competitive growth in 2021.,10
report,unilever,"The US, for example, grew almost 4% on top of a record growth year in 2020, while India and China grew well into double-digits, albeit against weaker comparators.",28
report,unilever,"Other markets also performed well, but not all.",8
report,unilever,"Indonesia, for example, a key geography for Unilever, struggled last year and was down by 7.4%.",16
report,unilever,"We are fully focused on restoring growth in this, our sixth-largest market.",12
report,unilever,Our next strategic choice is to invest in the capabilities needed to lead in channels of the future.,18
report,unilever,"Today, that means winning in eCommerce, and in 2021 we delivered another strong year, on the back of record growth in 2020.",22
report,unilever,"In total, the eCommerce business was up 44% with growth coming from all the main sub-channels pure-play, omnichannel, and business-tobusiness (eB2B).",21
report,unilever,"In just five years, this channel has gone from 2% of our turnover to 13% in 2021.",17
report,unilever,"Developing Unilever's portfolio into the higher growth spaces of Hygiene, Skin care, Prestige beauty, Functional nutrition and Plant-based foods is another strategic choice.",23
report,unilever,It is also one that made a meaningful contribution to performance in 2021.,13
report,unilever,"While organic growth is our first priority, acquisitions also play an important role.",13
report,unilever,"Indeed, since 2017, 93% of M&A capital has gone into either Prestige beauty, Functional nutrition or Skin care and other areas of Beauty & Personal Care.",26
report,unilever,"By contrast, 98% of disposals by turnover were in slower growth food segments such as Spreads and more recently Tea.",20
report,unilever,"The benefits of this portfolio rotation were very apparent last year which including eketerra will be equivalent to 17% of our ""We made good progress in 2021 and our growth momentum is building.""",33
report,unilever,"7 Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2021 of delivering an improvement in underlying operating margin, having chosen in the face of spiralling inflation to continue investing in advertising, R&D and other long-term drivers of growth.",35
report,unilever,"We will continue to take this approach in 2022, when we expect input cost inflation to ratchet up still further.",20
report,unilever,"This means that we expect our underlying operating margin will be down in 2022, although we anticipate that the effect of pricing action and well-established savings programmes to help reverse this decline over the course of 2023 and 2024.",39
report,unilever,"Importantly, we have entered 2022 with good growth momentum and with our biggest brands, our most important markets, and our priority channel all performing strongly.",25
report,unilever,"The five strategic choices that we have put in place will guide us in the years ahead, and are having a positive and demonstrable impact on performance.",27
report,unilever,The introduction of a new operating model during the year will help accelerate our progress still further.,17
report,unilever,"Together with our world-leading brands, our biggest strength remains the dedication and professionalism of our employees around the world, plus the millions more who make up Unilever's extended family across the value chain.",33
report,unilever,"To all of them, I offer my sincere appreciation for their hard work and commitment over a year characterised by many challenges but also a lot of progress.",28
report,unilever,"We remain fully wedded to Unilever's multi-stakeholder model and I want to thank all of those with whom we have partnered over the last year, and all those whose needs and interests we are committed to serving.",37
report,unilever,"We deliberately cite the planet as one of our stakeholders and in the year of COP26, it was a source of particular pride to see Unilever in its words and actions living up to its ambitious climate commitments.",38
report,unilever,"Finally, I want to thank and acknowledge our shareholders for their continued support of our business.",16
report,unilever,We are working hard to repay that support and are fully focused on delivering longterm value for shareholders in line with our 4G growth model.,25
report,unilever,"Prestige beauty, for example, now a 1 billion business, grew over 20%.",12
report,unilever,"Functional nutrition, which includes Horlicks in South Asia as well as our largely US-based Vitamins, Supplements & Minerals (VMS) business, grew 22% in 2021 and now enjoys leadership positions across its portfolio.",32
report,unilever,"Together, Functional nutrition and Prestige beauty contributed 60bps to our underlying sales growth last year.",15
report,unilever,"We will go on building Unilever's portfolio in this way, while recognising that not all acquisitions have performed equally well.",20
report,unilever,"Dollar Shave Club, for example, has not delivered in the way that we had hoped or expected, mainly due to changes in the economics of the model.",27
report,unilever,"In considering the evolution of our portfolio, Consumer Health and Wellbeing undoubtedly represents an attractive space.",16
report,unilever,It is also one in which we are increasingly well positioned.,11
report,unilever,"Last year, after a long period of careful review, the Board concluded that moving Unilever's portfolio even more decisively into this area would position the company for faster growth in the coming decades.",33
report,unilever,This is what lay behind confidential discussions with GSK and Pfizer about the possible acquisition of GSK Consumer Health.,19
report,unilever,We listened carefully to shareholders in the wake of those discussions becoming public and heard the message that many did not support a deal on this scale at this time.,30
report,unilever,"We remain resolved in the direction of our portfolio evolution, but we have made clear that we do not intend to pursue similar large-scale acquisitions in the foreseeable future.",29
report,unilever,"Instead, we will continue to accelerate Unilever's growth through a rigorous focus on organic growth and by continuing to strengthen the portfolio through bolt-on acquisitions and selective disposals.",28
report,unilever,"Guided by our five Compass strategic choices, we are fully committed to stepping up the growth of our existing business.",20
report,unilever,"We will be aided significantly in this process by our fifth strategic choice building a purpose-led, future-fit organisation and growth culture.",21
report,unilever,"Having operated for some time under a relatively heavy matrix structure, with three global Divisions and 15 regional performance management units, we are now modernising Unilever's organisation with the introduction from 1 July 2022 of five Business Groups with full, responsibility for setting strategy and for delivering results.",48
report,unilever,The five Business Groups Beauty and Wellbeing; Personal Care; Home Care; Nutrition; and Ice Cream will have the power to drive performance by responding more quickly and directly to the consumer and channel dynamics that are unique to their Business Group.,41
report,unilever,"This is a big change for Unilever, one that we are confident will result in a simpler, faster and more agile way of operating, with more focused and expert categories and with greater empowerment and accountability flowing through the business.",40
report,unilever,"We are alive to the risks of a change management programme on this scale and have put in place a number of mitigating measures, including the creation of a well-resourced Transformation Office to oversee the detailed delivery of the programme in line with ambitious but achievable timescales.",47

report,unilever,"As our gateway to the people who buy and use our products, these customer partners are critical to our success.",20
report,unilever,Our customers had to adapt throughout the year to changes in people's buying habits as Covid-related restrictions came and went and shopping patterns shifted in different ways at different times around the world.,33
report,unilever,"One consistency was the ongoing growth of online retail with consumers shopping more and more online and new groups of shoppers, such as older age groups, joining them.",28
report,unilever,"During the year, global supply chain and logistics challenges made it harder for retailers to predict product availability.",18

report,unilever,"We believe that by helping smaller retailers engage with the digital economy, we can help them build more resilient and profitable businesses that also grow our sales.",27
report,unilever,"In 2021, we expanded our (eB2B) platforms co-created and owned by Unilever, such as Shikhar in India, Compra Agora in Brazil and GoToko in Indonesia, to help small retailers meet the changing needs of today's shoppers.",36

report,unilever,"We also work with a range of business partners, including industry peers, innovation agencies, universities and joint ventures, to help unlock growth and find solutions that benefit our stakeholders.",29
report,unilever,"Covid-related restrictions continued to challenge supply chains in 2021, with lockdowns affecting our suppliers' businesses in many parts of the world.",21
report,unilever,"Commodities, packaging and transport all experienced high levels of inflation.",10
report,unilever,"There were shortages of agricultural raw materials, such as tomatoes, soybean oil and rapeseed oil, caused by extreme weather conditions.",20
report,unilever,"And globally, supply chains and services were put under pressure due to labour shortages.",14
report,unilever,"Meanwhile, consumer demand rebounded in many areas, calling for deeper collaboration, agility and innovation with our network of partners to secure supplies and stay resilient.",25
report,unilever,"To overcome these challenges, we spread production of products across our manufacturing network and held inventory closer to the consumer to ensure availability.",23
report,unilever,"We also enhanced our procurement approach: partnering with scoutbee, for example, to bring AI into our supplier discovery process to quicken, streamline and strengthen our search for partners giving us a more resilient network.",34
report,unilever,Our ongoing success rests on working with many innovative and purposeful businesses and offering them a great experience.,18

report,unilever,"STRATEGIC REPORT REVIEW OF THE YEAR 51 Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2021 Our Climate Transition Action Plan: Annual Progress Report Our Climate Transition Action Plan (CTAP) sets out our climate strategy, defines our net zero and emission reduction goals, and the actions we intend to take to meet them.",50
report,unilever,Our goals are to: Reduce in absolute terms our operational (Scope 1 and 2) emissions by 100% by 2030 against a 2015 baseline;(a) with an interim goal to achieve a 70% reduction by 2025 against a 2015 baseline.,38
report,unilever,Halve the full value chain emissions of our products on a per consumer use basis by 2030 against a 2010 baseline.,21
report,unilever,"(b) Achieve net zero emissions covering Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions by 2039.",14
report,unilever,"(c) In the 2020s and 2030s, our primary focus will be to eliminate emissions in our operations and reduce emissions across our value chain(d) rather than purchasing carbon credits.",29
report,unilever,It is too early to estimate the amount of any residual value chain emissions but our plan is to balance these with carbon removals to achieve and maintain our net zero emissions goal.,33
report,unilever,We fully expect our approach to delivering our commitments to evolve as science progresses and the societal debate on net zero matures.,22
report,unilever,"For example, we're currently considering the recently issued guidance from the Science Based Targets initiative on net zero targets.",19
report,unilever,"See our website for our Climate Transition Action Plan To deliver the ambitious goals set out in our CTAP, we're focusing our actions in four key areas, which form the basis of this Annual Progress Report: our operations, our brands and products, our value chain and our wider influence on society.",51
report,unilever,"Our first ambition is to eliminate operational Scope 1 and 2 emissions from our factories, offices and research labs which make up approximately 2% of our GHG footprint.",28
report,unilever,We've reduced our operational emissions by 64% since 2015.,9
report,unilever,This puts us on track to achieve our interim milestone of a 70% reduction by 2025 see page 34 for our three-year performance.,23
report,unilever,We're taking action in a number of areas to decarbonise our operations.,12
report,unilever,"Eco-efficiency For years we've invested in eco-efficiency projects across our factories, reducing CO2 from energy per tonne of production by 77% compared to 2008 and by 14% versus 2020.",29
report,unilever,"Recent investments include improving energy efficiency of lighting and manufacturing equipment, and installing heat recovery systems.",16
report,unilever,We've committed to align our future capital expenditure with the Paris Agreement.,12
report,unilever,"As a first step, in 2021 we developed a bespoke digital tool to capture the GHG, water and waste impact data of all capital expenditure projects.",26
report,unilever,Renewable electricity Transitioning to renewable electricity is a significant driver of emissions reduction in our operations.,16
report,unilever,"Our preference is to support local renewable energy markets through purchasing renewable electricity contracts called Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs), or green Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) to match our grid power demand, where these are available and can be sourced in a cost competitive way.",44
report,unilever,"Where this is not possible, and as the next best option, we seek to purchase unbundled RECs sold separately from electricity in the same market.",25
report,unilever,"Only as a last resort, and when unbundled RECs are not available in a market where we buy electricity, do we buy unbundled RECs in an adjacent market.",28
report,unilever,"In January 2020, we reached our target of purchasing 100% renewable grid electricity for our operations through a combination of PPAs and RECs (bundled and unbundled).",26
report,unilever,"Since we set this target, we've worked with the RE100 campaign to evolve industry best practice in renewable electricity reporting.",20
report,unilever,"From 2021, we're aligning our reporting with the updated RE100 guidance which requires us to make two changes.",18
report,unilever,"First, for renewable electricity certified with RECs, we will only report as 'renewable' the electricity where the accompanying RECs originate in the same market.",24
report,unilever,"While we intend to maintain our commitment to ensure our purchase of renewable grid electricity is matched by an equivalent volume of renewable electricity generation, we'll no longer count the purchase of unbundled RECs from an adjacent market in our renewable electricity reporting.",43
report,unilever,"While this will lower our reported renewable electricity percentage, we support the aims of RE100 to increase transparency in the global renewable power landscape, which we hope will help to accelerate the provision of renewable power in all markets.",39
report,unilever,The second change is to include non-grid sourced electricity.,9
report,unilever,"Currently, we use biomass in combined heat and power (CHP) boilers at a limited number of sites.",17
report,unilever,"As well as providing thermal energy (see below), they also supply our sites with electricity.",15
report,unilever,From 2021 we'll include this within our renewable electricity reporting.,10
report,unilever,"We'll also include the renewable electricity generated at our factory sites, for example, the on-site solar installations in 24 countries.",20
report,unilever,In 2021 we generated almost 3% of our total electricity from on-site renewable sources.,14
report,unilever,"Taking into account the updated definition and widened scope of our renewable electricity reporting, in 2021, 86% of our total electricity was from renewable sources.",25
report,unilever,"Against the new scope and definitions, the prior year would have been 80%.",13
report,unilever,See page 56 for a more detailed breakdown of our electricity by source.,13
report,unilever,"Renewable thermal energy In addition to renewable electricity, we aim to transition heating sources (typically CHP boilers for hot air, water and steam) to renewable energy alternatives.",27
report,unilever,"By early 2020, we had stopped using direct coal on-site for thermal energy, except for three factories acquired in 2020",20
report,unilever,52 Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2021 as part of our acquisition of the Horlicks portfolio in India and other predominantly Asian markets.,23
report,unilever,"In 2021, we eliminated direct coal from these three factories through the use of biomass and biodiesel.",17
report,unilever,We're exploring options to eliminate indirect coal from steam supplied by third parties by 2030.,15
report,unilever,"We're phasing out gas-fired boilers and exploring new renewable heating technologies such as heat pumps, concentrated solar power and lower carbon biogenic-derived sources.",23
report,unilever,These technologies could provide up to half of our thermal energy needs by 2025.,14
report,unilever,We have strict criteria to ensure we deliver genuine lifecycle carbon reductions.,12
report,unilever,"In 2022, we will publish details on how we'll ensure any biofuels we use do not lead to deforestation, compete with food supplies, and are sourced from local waste materials where possible.",32
report,unilever,"Many of the low-carbon heating options we're exploring are not yet commercially viable or widely available, so we're supporting innovation and looking for ways to trial them.",27
report,unilever,We see hydrogen produced using renewable energy as a potential industrial scale low-carbon alternative to natural gas.,17
report,unilever,Our Port Sunlight factory in the UK is supporting a trial of hydrogen technology.,14

report,unilever,"When replacing these, we aim to use the greenest version available for the purpose needed.",15
report,unilever,By the end of 2021 we had replaced HCFCs at 29 sites.,12
report,unilever,Food waste Our first priority is to reduce the amount of food waste we generate in the first place we're aiming to halve food waste in our operations by 2025.,30
report,unilever,This will also help to reduce our GHG emissions.,9
report,unilever,"By the end of 2021, we'd reduced food waste per tonne of food handled in our operations by 3% versus 2019.",21
report,unilever,Our progress in reducing manufacturing food waste has been hampered by Covid-related disruptions.,13
report,unilever,"We're exploring solutions with our engineering teams such as anaerobic digestion, using the biogas generated on-site, composting and using the waste as fertiliser.",23
report,unilever,Designing our products to be lower carbon will help us to reduce our indirect Scope 3 footprint and strengthens the appeal of our brands to consumers.,26
report,unilever,"In some cases, it can also help consumers reduce their own footprint (see page 53).",15

report,unilever,"These are predicted to reduce GHG emissions and water use by an estimated 30% while improving biodiversity, soil health and livelihoods.",21
report,unilever,"As part of our Beauty & Personal Care's Positive Beauty strategy (see page 21), the Fund is working on innovative financing and collaboration partnerships to support the delivery of our commitment to protect and regenerate 1.5 million hectares of land, forests and oceans by 2030.",45
report,unilever,This is more land than we use to grow renewable ingredients for the Division's products.,15
report,unilever,"Our value chain encompasses upstream and downstream Scope 3 emissions, excluding indirect consumer use-phase emissions (see page 53 for more on consumer use).",23
report,unilever,"Our focus is on tackling emissions from raw materials (including aerosol propellants), packaging materials, logistics and distribution networks, ice cream cabinets, and the disposal of waste products and packaging.",29
report,unilever,"Raw materials We've developed GHG reduction roadmaps for key materials and ingredients which contribute to our upstream Scope 3 GHG emissions, including dairy.",23
report,unilever,"Our roadmaps identify how we can reduce emissions through product reformulations, different raw materials and supplier innovation partnerships.",18
report,unilever,It is particularly critical that we work in partnership with our suppliers as 1.5 C-aligned emission reduction pathways for the majority of these materials are still unclear and it is only through collaboration that we will find solutions.,38
report,unilever,"In 2021, we invited our suppliers to commit to setting a public target to halve absolute GHG emissions by 2030, report their progress and share their data with us.",29
report,unilever,"We're exploring new ways to support suppliers through guidance, tools and resources, particularly for the 300 suppliers who have the most significant GHG emissions.",24
report,unilever,"In 2021, we began working with a small group to help us shape the programme, and we ll launch a pilot in 2022, before further roll-out in 2023.",28
report,unilever,"We're also encouraging other companies to work with their suppliers, for example through the 1.5 C Supplier Engagement Guide, launched by the 1.5 C Supply Chain Leaders initiative at COP26.",30
report,unilever,We cannot achieve our climate goals if our operations or supply chain contribute to deforestation.,15
report,unilever,Our suppliers and other partners will play a critical role in helping us achieve a deforestation-free supply chain for five key commodities by 2023.,24
report,unilever,Read more on tackling deforestation on page 30.,8
report,unilever,Packaging materials We've set ambitious plastic commitments including to halve our virgin plastic footprint by 2025.,16
report,unilever,Key to achieving this will be by increasing our use of recycled plastic.,13
report,unilever,"Our goal is to use at least 25% recycled plastic by 2025, and this year we achieved approximately 17%.",19
report,unilever,"We're also reducing our use of virgin plastic by shifting to refillable, reusable or naked (unwrapped) products which use less or no plastic.",23
report,unilever,"In 2021, we saw strong sales of concentrated home refill laundry and we continue to expand our in-store and at-home refill pilots, with about 15 in progress around the world.",30
report,unilever,"We're also exploring materials like paper and board, using life cycle analysis to ensure any switch away from plastic doesn't end up increasing our GHG footprint.",26
report,unilever,Read more about plastic on page 29.,7
report,unilever,Logistics and distribution More than 90% of our logistics emissions come from our logistics suppliers.,15
report,unilever,We've begun using lower carbon alternative fuels such as liquified natural gas (LNG) or compressed natural gas (CNG) in 12 countries and piloted zero emission electric trucks with partners in three countries with plans to scale to more.,38
report,unilever,"We also signed up to a new shipping coalition, Cargo Owners for Zero Emission Vessels (coZEV) to help accelerate the decarbonisation of the shipping industry.",25
report,unilever,"In our own car fleet, we developed country roadmaps to achieve 100% electric vehicles (EVs) or hybrids by 2030, taking into account the availability of EVs, charging infrastructure and financial support or subsidies.",33
report,unilever,"In 2021, across six of the most EV-ready countries, EVs and hybrids made up 6% of the fleet.",18
report,unilever,"Retail emissions In 2021, all the new freezers we purchased to cool our ice creams in-store used lower carbon natural hydrocarbon refrigerants.",22
report,unilever,We estimate that over 90% of the 3 million freezers in our fleet now use these refrigerants.,17
report,unilever,"We're investing in energy-efficient freezers, with the average energy use per cabinet falling by 3% compared to 2020.",18
report,unilever,We're also looking at warming up' the cold chain so that less energy is needed to refrigerate products across their life.,21
report,unilever,"Aerosol propellants We typically use hydrocarbon propellant gases in hairsprays, body sprays and deodorants.",14
report,unilever,"In the US, our largest deodorant and hair market, Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) regulations restrict the use of formulations used elsewhere.",21
report,unilever,Our primary focus has been to find regulatory solutions in the US to enable the use of alternative propellant systems which have a lower GHG footprint compared to hydrocarbon and hydrofluorocarbon propellants and help improve air quality.,37
report,unilever,Provisions have been added to the US VOC regulations to allow the use of compressed gas propellants.,17
report,unilever,We're now exploring alternative formulations and formats in key markets.,10
report,unilever,"Disposal of waste products Our products have a GHG impact at the end of their life, as ingredients break down and release emissions.",23
report,unilever,We're switching to plant-based 100% biodegradable formulations across our Home Care portfolio.,12
report,unilever,"For example, Lifebuoy's BotaniTech range made from naturally derived and 100% biodegradable cleaning ingredients launched in five markets in 2021.",20
report,unilever,"And Comfort launched its Ultimate Care range, which contains new biodegradable technology to extend the life of clothes.",18
report,unilever,54 Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2021 We're advocating for changes that will ultimately reduce the impact of our products when used by consumers as well as accelerating progress in other areas of our value chain.,36
report,unilever,"Consumer use Around two-thirds of our products' GHG impact comes from their use by consumers (indirect downstream Scope 3 emissions), for instance from energy used by washing machines or hot water used for showering.",34
report,unilever,"There's a limit to how much we can influence emissions from product use as consumers make their own choices on how long they shower, which energy provider they use, and how efficient their home appliances are.",36
report,unilever,"We're therefore reliant, as many companies are, on the decarbonisation of the energy grid to reduce our downstream Scope 3 footprint.",21
report,unilever,"We're using our influence to advocate for system-wide change, such as acceleration of renewable energy globally, which will help reduce emissions in consumers' homes see below for more on our advocacy.",31
report,unilever,"In addition, we're committed to using technology and innovation to provide consumers with superior and lower carbon products while growing our business.",22
report,unilever,"This is already visible in Home Care's Clean Future strategy (with a focus on renewable and recycled carbon ingredients see page 23), in Foods & Refreshment's Future Foods strategy (with a focus on plant-based foods see page 22), and Beauty & Personal Care's Positive Beauty strategy (with a focus on sustainable sourcing, deforestation-free palm oil and nature-based solutions see page 21).",61
report,unilever,"Our product lifecycle GHG emissions per consumer use have reduced by 14% since 2010 and by 4% since 2020, while our absolute Scope 3 emissions (from consumer use, ingredients and packaging and distribution and retail) increased by 1% versus 2020, as our sales increased over the same period.",48
report,unilever,"The reduction in GHG emissions per consumer use is driven by our Foods & Refreshment and Home Care Divisions, where emissions have fallen by 32% and 43% respectively since 2010.",30
report,unilever,"This is mainly due to grid decarbonisation, portfolio changes and product reformulation, such as the removal of phosphates in our laundry products.",22
report,unilever,"Over the same period, GHG emissions per consumer use from our Beauty & Personal Care Division have increased by 6% despite ongoing grid decarbonisation driven primarily by the acquisition of brands with hair, bath and shower products which have high GHG emissions associated with consumer hot water use.",48

report,unilever,The process for assessing and identifying climate-related risks is the same for the principal risks and is described on page 44.,21
report,unilever,The risks are reviewed and assessed on an ongoing basis and formally at least once per year.,17
report,unilever,"For each of our principal risks we have a risk management framework detailing the controls we have in place, who is responsible for managing both the overall risk and the individual controls mitigating it.",34
report,unilever,We monitor risks throughout the year to identify changes in the risk profile.,13
report,unilever,"We regularly carry out climate-related risk assessments at site level, supplier level, as well as innovation-project level.",17
report,unilever,Climate-related risks are managed by the team relevant to where the risk resides.,13
report,unilever,"For example, climate risks in relation to commodities in the supply chain are managed by our procurement team.",18
report,unilever,We have conducted several high-level scenario analyses on the potential impacts of climate change to help us consider and adapt our strategies and financial planning.,25
report,unilever,"In prior years, we have reported the potential financial impacts of climate change on our business in 2030 if average global temperatures were to rise by 2 C and 4 C above pre-industrial levels by 2100.",36
report,unilever,"This analysis led us to understand that limiting warming to 2 C would primarily expose us to economic and regulatory transition risks, whereas a 4 C warming level would expose us to unprecedented physical risks.",35
report,unilever,"In 2021, as new scientific evidence was released by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the global consensus around the need of governments to commit to a 1.5 C world strengthened, we extended our scenario analyses to assess the impacts of a 1.5 C temperature increase above pre-industrial levels by 2100 on our business in 2030, 2039 and 2050.",62
report,unilever,The IPCC also sets out multiple pathways that the world could take to limit global warming to 1.5 C. The nature of the pathway taken significantly impacts the risks and opportunities that a business will face.,36
report,unilever,"In assessing the material risks and opportunities Unilever would face in a world focused on achieving 1.5 C we have reviewed in detail two pathways, proactive' and reactive', that we assessed as more likely than other more extreme possible pathways.",40
report,unilever,"In the proactive' route, there is an early and steady reduction of emissions as a result of a fast response from all economic actors, meaning there is less dependence on technological advancements to remove carbon from the atmosphere in the second half of the century.",45
report,unilever,"Conversely, in the reactive' route, significant action by economic actors is delayed to 2030, after which a very rapid transition across all actors is required, accompanied by deployment at a very large scale of low-carbon energy and carbon removal activities and technology.",42
report,unilever,"Climate scenarios: 1.5 C, 2 C and 4 C Aggressive and persistent regulation from today Dramatic changes to lifestyle from today, towards minimising climate impact and social inequality Reliance on available and proven technologies Lower reliance on carbon removal technologies Risks and opportunities assessed in creating our 1.5 C scenario In creating our 1.5 C scenario analysis, we took the two pathways and considered the five broad types of risks and opportunities using the TCFD risk framework: Regulatory risks; Market risks; Physical environment risks; Innovative products and services opportunities; and Resource efficiency, resilience, and market opportunities.",96
report,unilever,"We identified approximately 40 specific risk and opportunity areas which could impact us in 2030, 2039 and 2050, each of which we assessed qualitatively, supported where possible with high-level quantitative assessments.",31
report,unilever,The assessments are based on financial scenarios and do not represent financial forecasts.,13
report,unilever,They exclude any actions that we might undertake to mitigate or adapt to these risks.,15
report,unilever,The quantitative assessments were developed to understand high-level materiality and order of magnitude financial impact rather than perform detailed simulations or forecasts on the long-term future of markets and products.,30

report,unilever,We support the use of carbon pricing as an important tool to help us achieve our zero emissions goal.,19
report,unilever,Our carbon pricing approach is a mechanism which creates a sustainable capital investment fund which is then used to fund capital investments to decarbonise our operations.,26
report,unilever,"We support EPR policies and schemes and we're investing directly in waste collection, processing and capacity-building projects to recycle more plastic.",21
report,unilever,"Market risks: Energy transition and rising energy prices could be driven by increased electrification, the deployment of renewable energy solutions, associated transmission, distribution and storage infrastructure, as well as the adoption of emerging low-carbon technologies such as biogas, green hydrogen and ammonia.",42
report,unilever,"This could impact our operations, suppliers, and end-consumers' utility costs.",10
report,unilever,"Energy and commodity market volatility could potentially lead to increased uncertainty in financial planning and forecasting for key commodities, as well as a higher cost associated with risk management.",29
report,unilever,Other considerations include potential manufacturing or supply disruptions linked to availability or higher cost of energy and sourced commodities.,19
report,unilever,"Actions taken: We're mitigating market risks by decarbonising our operations through eco-efficiency measures in our factories, powering our operations with renewables and transitioning heating and cooling for our factories to lower emission and renewable sources (see page 51).",38
report,unilever,We manage commodity price risks through forward-buying of traded commodities and other hedging mechanisms.,14
report,unilever,Physical environment risks: Water scarcity would lead to increased droughts while limited resources to irrigate soils could reduce crop outputs.,20
report,unilever,Water shortages could also impact our manufacturing sites and our ability to supply water-based products.,15
report,unilever,"Our consumers could also face water shortages in their everyday activities in certain regions, creating a need for water-smart or waterless products or services.",24
report,unilever,Extreme weather events could significantly disrupt our entire value chain.,10
report,unilever,Sustained high temperatures could lead to reduced crop outputs due to reduction in soil productivity which could translate into higher raw material prices.,23
report,unilever,"Weather events such as hurricanes or floods, which would become increasingly common and intense, could cause plant outages or disrupt our distribution infrastructure.",23
report,unilever,"Additionally, macroeconomic negative shocks among affected communities could reduce or destroy consumer demand and purchasing power.",16
report,unilever,"Actions taken: We're mitigating physical environment risks by investing in new products and formulations that work with less water, poor quality water or no water.",25
report,unilever,"Many of our hair care products now have fast-rinse technology as standard, using less water.",15
report,unilever,We're expanding our water stewardship programme to 100 locations in water-stressed areas by 2030 (see page 30).,17
report,unilever,"We monitor changing weather patterns on a short-term basis and integrate weather system Out of all the risks and opportunities we assessed, there are 11 which we believe are significant and we summarise these below.",35
report,unilever,"We have combined the outputs from the proactive' and reactive' analyses since the risks and opportunities are similar, with differences in the size and timing of impact.",27
report,unilever,"Where we have been able to quantify the risk, the ranges represent potential impacts of the different pathways.",18
report,unilever,Actions to mitigate the risks and capitalise on the opportunities have been consolidated into our Compass strategy (pages 8 to 11) and our CTAP (pages 51 to 56).,28
report,unilever,Below we summarise the actions we're taking for each of the areas considered in our 1.5 C scenario assessments.,19
report,unilever,Regulatory risks: Carbon pricing includes carbon taxes and voluntary removal or offset costs.,13
report,unilever,Tightening regional or national regulations as well as climate commitments across individual businesses could drive widespread implementation of these taxes or market schemes.,23
report,unilever,"This could translate into rising direct and indirect costs linked to carbon emissions, where the strongest impact would likely be on costs of sales linked to raw materials, production, and distribution emissions.",32
report,unilever,Carbon taxes on household emissions or costs passed through to our consumers linked to household emissions may impact their disposable income and ultimately their purchasing power.,26
report,unilever,"Land use regulation could drive reforms to radically restructure current global land use patterns to conserve and expand forest land, serving as the main natural carbon removal solution.",28
report,unilever,"This could reduce land available for food crops, pasture, and timber and hence access to our primary commodities which could drive reduced crop output and increase raw material prices.",29
report,unilever,Product composition regulations could restrict or ban the use of certain GHG intensive components and ingredients in everyday products.,19
report,unilever,"This would require the redesign of products and packaging to comply, which could increase costs.",15
report,unilever,"Sourcing transparency and product labelling regulations could increase significantly through pressure from regulators, consumers, and investors.",16
report,unilever,"This could lead to disclosure compliance risks and rising commodity costs linked to radical transition to transparent supply chains, as well as a potential loss of market share to more transparent competitors.",32
report,unilever,Extended producer responsibility (EPR) would mean that producers are held accountable for their environmental and social impacts across the product value chain.,22
report,unilever,This could lead to improvements of lifecycle traceability from sourcing to managing treatment of products and packaging.,17
report,unilever,"Circular product design and manufacturing practices could become a requirement in many regions to incentivise efficient and responsible resource extraction, and pass waste management costs through higher disposal and recycling fees to producers.",33
report,unilever,60 Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2021 modelling into our forecasting process.,12
report,unilever,To mitigate negative effects from extreme weather we have contingency plans to secure alternative key material supplies at short notice or transfer or share production between manufacturing sites.,28
report,unilever,We manage commodity price risks through forward-buying of traded commodities and other hedging mechanisms.,14
report,unilever,Our Regenerative Agriculture Principles and Sustainable Agriculture Code encourage our agricultural raw material suppliers to adopt practices which increase their productivity and resilience to extreme weather.,26
report,unilever,"In addition to these risks inherent in the pathways to a 1.5 C world, there are also opportunities which would arise from emerging needs for products and services which are delivered sustainably at an appropriate price.",36
report,unilever,There are two specific opportunities which this scenario analysis highlighted: Innovative products and services opportunities: Growth in plant-based or lab-grown foods could increase rapidly in the coming years.,28
report,unilever,"As people become more environmentally conscious and there is regulation on land use, we could see a rise in plant-based diets away from animal-based protein.",25
report,unilever,Actions taken: We're capitalising on innovative product and service opportunities by offering a range of vegan and vegetarian products.,19
report,unilever,We have a target to grow sales from our plant-based meat and dairy alternatives business to 1 billion per annum by 2025-2027 (see page 22).,25
report,unilever,"Resource efficiency, resilience and market opportunities: Investment in energy transition technologies represents a shift to efficient and less centralised energy supply and consumption (e.g.",24
report,unilever,"through on-site renewable energy generation and storage), zero-emission logistics and designing products for resource-efficient consumption.",15
report,unilever,"This could drive decarbonisation across the value chain, while opening up the opportunity to access the utility market as an off-grid generator and create new revenue streams from grid balancing or demand side response services or providing excess renewable power of oversized capacity to supply chain partners.",47
report,unilever,"Actions taken: We're capitalising on resource efficiency opportunities by generating renewable electricity at our factory sites where feasible (see page 51), targeting emissions reduction from our logistics suppliers and own vehicle fleet (see page 53) and through product reformulations which make our products more resource efficient in use for example, many of our laundry products are now low-temperature washing as standard (see page 23).",64
report,unilever,"For those risks and opportunities where we have undertaken high-level quantitative assessments, the results are shown in the tables below.",20
report,unilever,These assessments show the gross impact before any action which Unilever might take to respond.,15
report,unilever,The ranges reflect the different results from the reactive and proactive pathways assessed.,13
report,unilever,We first undertook scenario analysis in 2017 on 2 C and 4 C scenarios.,14
report,unilever,This year we have completed a 1.5 C scenario analysis.,10
report,unilever,The results of this work on the way to 1.5 C is consistent with this previous work.,17
report,unilever,The key differences are due to: the more extreme measures that would need to be taken to achieve a 1.5 C outcome; the evolution of the scientific assumptions contained within the IPCC's AR6 report; and a more detailed approach to the scenario analysis.,43
report,unilever,The financial impact in 2030 is more significant in the 1.5 C scenario.,13
report,unilever,"However, the scenario avoids the greater negative impacts from the physical risks associated with higher temperature rise scenarios in 2050 and beyond.",22

report,unilever,"I also reflect on the feedback we received on our new Directors' Remuneration Policy, which was approved at the May 2021 AGM (referred to as the Remuneration Policy).",28
report,unilever,2021 was a year of volatility with continued impact from the Covid-19 pandemic and unprecedented global commodity inflation driven by supply constraints and demand spikes.,25
report,unilever,"In this context, we delivered Underlying Sales Growth (USG) of +4.5%, above our par target of 3.5%, driven by strong pricing of +2.9% and volume growth of 1.6%.",28
report,unilever,Our growth was competitive with 53% of our business gaining market share on a Moving Annual Total basis.,18
report,unilever,The severe mismatch between supply and demand resulted in a once in a two-decade spike in commodity and logistics cost inflation.,21
report,unilever,"Prices of core ingredients have risen significantly versus early 2020 levels; Brent Crude Oil +60%, Soyabean Oil +90% and Palm Oil +130%.",22

report,unilever,"Overall, Underlying Operating Profit grew 2.9%.",6

report,unilever,"Incentive outcomes and wider stakeholder considerations 2021 Annual Bonus After careful consideration, the Committee decided neither to change the targets in response to volatile business conditions nor to exercise discretion on the formulaic outcome, which will set the global bonus pool for all eligible Unilever employees.",46

report,unilever,"In particular, our decision not to amend targets mid-year in light of significant inflationary conditions was taken to ensure that employees and Executive Directors are treated commensurately with the interests of our shareholders.",33
report,unilever,The final outcomes of 81% of target for annual bonus and 87% of target for MCIP are below our expectations.,20
report,unilever,"However, the Committee believes these outcomes represent the performance delivered to shareholders in challenging trading circumstances.",16

report,unilever,"On 1 January 2021, an intellectual property swap transaction occurred between the Company and certain Group entities resulting in transfer of intellectual property related to Foods and Refreshment by the Company to a Group entity in exchange for intellectual property related to Home Care and Beauty and Personal Care (HC BPC).",51
report,unilever,Thereafter the Company transferred the intellectual property related to HC BPC to another Group entity.,15
report,unilever,The Directors applied judgement to determine that the transaction had commercial substance and therefore was recorded at fair value.,19
report,unilever,We identified the accounting for the transaction as a key audit matter due to the magnitude of the unrealised gain in the context of the Company Accounts.,27
report,unilever,"We spent a significant amount of time and resources on the transaction to assess the fair value of the intangible assets, the interpretation of UK and Dutch tax law as well as the interpretation of financial reporting standards.",38
report,unilever,The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this key audit matter: We assessed the accounting for the transaction considering the requirements under the applicable financial reporting standards.,30
report,unilever,"We involved tax professionals with specialised skills and knowledge to assist in evaluating the tax impact of the transaction, based on the applicable laws and regulations.",26
report,unilever,We involved valuation professionals with specialised skills and knowledge to assist in evaluating the methodology applied to determine the fair value.,21
report,unilever,We assessed the adequacy of disclosures in respect of this transaction in the Company Accounts.,15
report,unilever,We performed the tests above rather than seeking to rely on any of the Company's controls because the nature of the balance is such that we would expect to obtain audit evidence primarily through the detailed procedures described.,38
report,unilever,We found the accounting for the transaction to be acceptable.,10
report,unilever,"The key audit matter Our response and results In the prior year, we reported key audit matters in respect of uncertain direct tax transfer pricing provisions, valuation of Horlicks Brand acquired from GSK and accounting for the Unification of Unilever's Corporate structure.",42
report,unilever,We continue to perform procedures over uncertain direct tax transfer pricing provisions.,12
report,unilever,"However, pursuant to settlements with tax authorities in FY 2020 resulting in a reduction in the value and quantum of the exposure, we have not assessed this as one of the most significant risks in our current year audit and, therefore, it is not separately identified in our report this year.",51
report,unilever,The key audit matters in relation to the valuation of Horlicks Brand acquired from GSK and accounting for the Unification of Unilever's Corporate structure related to transactions in 2020.,29
report,unilever,"Our application of materiality and an overview of the scope of our audit Materiality Materiality for the Consolidated Financial Statements as a whole was set at 380 million (2020: 380 million), determined with reference to a benchmark of Group profit before taxation, of which it represents 4.4% (2020: 4.8%).",49
report,unilever,"Materiality for the Company Accounts as a whole was set at 296 million (2020: 298 million), determined with reference to a benchmark of Company Net Assets, of which it represents 0.4% (2020: 0.4%).",33
report,unilever,"In line with our audit methodology, our procedures on individual account balances and disclosures were performed to a lower threshold, performance materiality, so as to reduce to an acceptable level the risk that individually immaterial misstatements in individual account balances add up to a material amount across the financial statements as a whole.",53
report,unilever,"Performance materiality for the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Company Accounts set at 75% (2020: 75%) of materiality for the financial statements as a whole, which equates to 285 million for the Group (2020: 285 million) and 222 million (2020: 224 million) for the Company.",45
report,unilever,We applied this percentage in our determination of performance materiality because we did not identify any factors indicating an elevated level of risk.,23
report,unilever,"We agreed with the Audit Committee that any corrected or uncorrected identified misstatements exceeding 20 million (2020: 20 million) and 14 million (2020: 15 million) which are identified during the audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and Company Accounts respectively, would be reported to them, as well as smaller misstatements that in our view must be reported on qualitative grounds.",60
report,unilever,Overall scope of our audit The Group operates through a significant number of legal entities and these form reporting components that are primarily country based.,25
report,unilever,"To provide sufficient coverage over the Group's key audit matters, we performed audits of 15 components (2020: 15), which are included within Audit for group reporting purposes' below, as well as audits of account balances including revenue and the related accounts receivables balances at a further 22 (2020: 22) components which are included within Audit of account balances' below.",59
report,unilever,The latter were not individually financially significant enough to require an audit for group reporting purposes but were included in the scope of our group reporting work in order to provide additional coverage.,33
report,unilever,"The Group operates centralised operating centres in China, India, Mexico, Philippines and Poland that perform accounting and reporting activities alongside related controls.",22
report,unilever,"Together, these operating centres process a substantial portion of the Group's transactions.",12
report,unilever,The outputs from the centralised operating centres are included in the financial information of the reporting components they service and therefore they are not separate reporting components.,27
report,unilever,Each of the operating centres is subject to specified audit procedures.,11
report,unilever,Further audit procedures are performed at each reporting component to cover matters not covered at the centralised operating centres and together this results in audits for group reporting purposes on those reporting components.,33
report,unilever,Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2021 109,7
report,unilever,A substantial portion of these components utilise the operating centres and are therefore subject to audit procedures performed at these operating centres.,22
report,unilever,"For these components, we performed analysis at an aggregated Group level to re-examine our assessment that there were no significant risks of material misstatement within these.",26
report,unilever,"The Group audit team instructed component auditors as to the significant areas to be covered, including the key audit matters detailed above and the information to be reported back.",29
report,unilever,"The Group audit team approved the component materialities, which ranged from 4 million to 344 million (2020: 1 million to 328 million), having regard to the mix of size and risk profile of the Group across the components.",38
report,unilever,The work on components was performed by component auditors.,9
report,unilever,In view of the continued restrictions on the movement of people across borders the Group audit team's planned audit approach involved using video conferencing to oversee the component auditor work and to hold video discussions with management of selected component locations in scope of the Group audit.,47
report,unilever,"Furthermore, to evaluate the component auditors' communications and the adequacy of their work, we requested those component auditors to provide us with remote access to audit workpapers to perform these evaluations, subject to local law and regulations.",37
report,unilever,"In addition, due to the inability to arrange in-person meetings with such component auditors, we increased the use of alternative methods of communication with them, including through written instructions, exchange of emails and virtual meetings.",35
report,unilever,"The Group audit team held virtual meetings with local management in Brazil, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Netherlands, UK, USA, UAE and South Africa (2020: virtual meetings with local management in Brazil, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Netherlands, UK and USA).",43
report,unilever,Online meetings were also held with the component auditors in these locations and majority of the other locations in scope for group reporting.,23
report,unilever,The findings reported to the Group audit team were discussed in more detail with component auditors and any further work required by the Group audit team was then performed by the component auditors.,33
report,unilever,The work on 36 of the 37 components (2020: 36 of the 37 components) was performed by component auditors (KPMG member firms).,22
report,unilever,The audit of the company was performed by the Group audit team.,12
report,unilever,"We were able to rely upon the Group's internal control over financial reporting in all areas of our audit, and where our controls testing supported this approach, which enabled us to reduce the scope of our substantive audit work.",39
report,unilever,"The impact of climate change on our audit In planning our audit, we considered the potential impacts of risks arising from climate change on the Group's business and its financial statements.",31
report,unilever,"The Group has set out its targets under its Climate Transition Action Plan (CTAP) to reduce operational emissions by 100% by 2030; with an interim goal to achieve a 70% reduction by 2025 against a 2015 baseline, to halve the full value chain emissions of its products on a per consumer use basis by 2030 against a 2010 baseline and to achieve net zero emissions covering Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions by 2039.",74
report,unilever,Detailed information is provided in the Strategic Report on page 34 and in the CTAP and TCFD sections on pages 51 to 62.,23
report,unilever,"Whilst the Group has set these targets, in note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements the Directors have stated that they have considered the impact of climate change risks and that they do not believe that there is a material impact on the financial reporting judgements and estimates and as a result the valuations of the Group's assets and liabilities have not been significantly impacted by these risks as at 31 December 2021.",73
report,unilever,As a part of our audit we have performed a risk assessment to determine if the potential impacts of climate change may materially affect the financial statements and our audit.,30
report,unilever,We did this by making inquiries of management and inspecting internal and external reports in order to independently assess the climate-related risks and their potential impact.,26
report,unilever,We held discussions with our own climate change professionals to challenge our risk assessment.,14
report,unilever,The most likely potential impact of climate risk and plans on these financial statements would be on the forward-looking assessments of longterm assets.,23
report,unilever,We have considered the sensitivity of the assumptions used in the impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite-life intangible assets.,19
report,unilever,"Given that the assumptions are not considered a major source of estimation uncertainty, the carrying amounts of these assets in the financial statements are not considered to be sensitive to the impact of risks arising from climate change.",38
report,unilever,"As a result of this, and the relative size of other long-term assets which could be impacted by climate change risks, we determined that climate related risks did not have a significant impact on our audit and there is no significant impact of these risks on our key audit matters.",50
report,unilever,We have also read the Group's disclosures of climate related information in the Strategic Report and considered consistency with the financial statements and our audit knowledge.,26
report,unilever,"The Directors have prepared the Financial Statements on the going concern basis as they do not intend to liquidate the Group or the Company or to cease their operations, and as they have concluded that the Group's and the Company's financial position means that this is realistic.",47
report,unilever,They have also concluded that there are no material uncertainties that could have cast significant doubt over their ability to continue as a going concern for at least a year from the date of approval of the financial statements ( the going concern period ).,45
report,unilever,"We used our knowledge of the Group, its industry, and the general economic environment to identify the inherent risks to its business model and analysed how those risks might affect the Group's and Company's financial resources or ability to continue operations over the going concern period.",46
report,unilever,The risks that we considered most likely to adversely affect the Group's and the Company's available financial resources over this period were: continued slowdown in the broader macro-economic environment and therefore market growth; increased global and local competition; and external pressures on gross margin through cost price inflation.,48
report,unilever,"We also considered realistic second order impacts, such as a major IT data breach and the loss of all material litigation cases which could result in a rapid reduction of available financial resources.",33
report,unilever,"We considered whether these risks could plausibly affect the liquidity in the going concern period by assessing the degree of downside assumptions that, individually and collectively, could result in a liquidity issue, taking into account the 110 Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2021",43
report,unilever,Group's current and projected cash and facilities and the outcome of their reverse stress testing.,15
report,unilever,We considered whether the going concern disclosure in note 1 to the financial statements gives a full and accurate description of the Directors' assessment of going concern.,27
report,unilever,"However, as we cannot predict all future events or conditions and as subsequent events may result in outcomes that are inconsistent with judgements that were reasonable at the time they were made, the above conclusions are not a guarantee that the Group or the Company will continue in operation.",49
report,unilever,Fraud and breaches of laws and regulations ability to detect Identifying and responding to risks of material misstatement due to fraud To identify risks of material misstatement due to fraud ( fraud risks ) we assessed events or conditions that could indicate an incentive or pressure to commit fraud or provide an opportunity to commit fraud.,56
report,unilever,"Our risk assessment procedures included: Enquiring of directors, the audit committee, internal audit and inspection of policy documentation as to the Group's high-level policies and procedures to prevent and detect fraud, including the internal audit function, and the Group's channel for whistleblowing , as well as whether they have knowledge of any actual, suspected or alleged fraud.",57

report,unilever,Using analytical procedures to identify any unusual or unexpected relationships.,10
report,unilever,Using our own forensic professionals with specialised skills and knowledge to assist us in identifying the fraud risks based on discussions of the circumstances of the Group.,27
report,unilever,We communicated identified fraud risks throughout the audit team and remained alert to any indications of fraud throughout the audit.,20
report,unilever,This included communication from the group to in-scope component audit teams of relevant fraud risks identified at the Group level and request to inscope component audit teams to report to the Group audit team any instances of fraud that could give rise to a material misstatement at group.,48
report,unilever,"As required by auditing standards, and taking into account possible pressures to meet profit targets, we performed procedures to address the risk of management override of controls and the risk of fraudulent revenue recognition.",34
report,unilever,Further detail in respect of Revenue recognition Discounts is set out in the key audit matter disclosures in section 2 of this report.,23
report,unilever,We did not identify any additional fraud risks.,8
report,unilever,In determining the audit procedures we took into account the results of our evaluation and testing of the operating effectiveness of the Group-wide fraud risk management controls.,27
report,unilever,For further details in respect to the Group-wide risk management controls refer to the report of the Audit Committee on page 78.,22
report,unilever,We also performed procedures including: Identifying manual journal entries to test for all in-scope components based on risk criteria and comparing the identified entries to supporting documentation.,27
report,unilever,Evaluating the business purpose of significant unusual transactions.,8
report,unilever,Assessing significant accounting estimates for bias.,6
report,unilever,"Identifying and responding to risks of material misstatement due to non-compliance with laws and regulations We identified areas of laws and regulations that could reasonably be expected to have a material effect on the financial statements from our general commercial and sector experience, through discussion with the Directors and other management (as required by auditing standards) and from inspection of the Group's regulatory and legal correspondence.",66
report,unilever,We discussed with the Directors and other management the policies and procedures regarding compliance with laws and regulations and we made use of our own forensic professionals with specialised skills and knowledge to assist us in evaluating the facts and circumstances.,41
report,unilever,We communicated identified laws and regulations throughout our team and remained alert to any indications of non-compliance throughout the audit.,20
report,unilever,"This included communication from the group to in-scope component audit teams of relevant laws and regulations identified at the Group level, and a request for in-scope component auditors to report to the group team any instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations that could give rise to a material misstatement at the Group level.",54
report,unilever,The potential effect of these laws and regulations on the financial statements varies considerably.,14
report,unilever,"Firstly, the Group is subject to laws and regulations that directly affect the financial statements including financial reporting legislation (including related companies legislation), distributable profits legislation and taxation legislation and we assessed the extent of compliance with these laws and regulations as part of our procedures on the related financial statement items.",52
report,unilever,"Secondly, the Group is subject to many other laws and regulations where the consequences of non-compliance could have a material effect on amounts or disclosures in the financial statements, for instance through the imposition of fines or litigation.",38
report,unilever,"We identified the following areas as those most likely to have such an effect: Competition legislation (reflecting the Group's involvement in a number of ongoing investigations by national competition authorities), Employment legislation (reflecting the Group's significant and geographically diverse work force).",41
report,unilever,Health and safety regulation (reflecting the nature of the Group's production and distribution processes).,14
report,unilever,Consumer product law such as product safety and product claims (reflecting the nature of the Group's diverse product base).,19
report,unilever,"Contract legislation (reflecting the Group's extensive use of trademarks, copyright and patents).",12
report,unilever,Data privacy (requirements from existing data privacy laws).,8
report,unilever,Environmental regulation (reflecting nature of the Group's production and distribution processes).,11
report,unilever,"Auditing standards limit the required audit procedures to identify non-compliance with these laws and regulations to enquiry of the directors and other management and inspection of regulatory and legal correspondence, if any.",32
report,unilever,"Therefore, if a breach of operational regulations is not disclosed to us or evident from relevant correspondence, an audit will not detect that breach.",24
report,unilever,"Context of the ability of the audit to detect fraud or breaches of law or regulation Owing to the inherent limitations of an audit, there is an unavoidable risk that we may not have detected some material misstatements in the financial statements, even though we have properly planned and performed our audit in accordance with auditing standards.",57
report,unilever,"For example, the further removed non-compliance with laws and regulations is from the events and transactions reflected in the financial statements, the less likely the inherently limited procedures required by auditing standards would identify it.",35
report,unilever,"In addition, as with any audit, there remained a higher risk of non-detection of fraud, as these may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls.",30

report,unilever,"Subject to the points noted below in respect of shares issued to clearance services (such as Euroclear Nederland) or which are issued into a depositary receipt system where the shares are to be held in ADS form, no stamp duty or SDRT will arise on the issue of shares in registered form by PLC.",54
report,unilever,"Except in relation to clearance services and depositary receipt systems (to which special rules outlined below apply), stamp duty at the rate of 0.5 per cent (rounded up to the next multiple of 5) of the amount or value of the consideration given will generally be payable on an instrument transferring PLC shares.",53
report,unilever,A charge to SDRT will also generally arise on an unconditional agreement to transfer PLC shares (at the rate of 0.5 per cent of the amount or value of the consideration payable).,32
report,unilever,"However, if within six years of the date of the agreement becoming unconditional, an instrument of transfer is executed pursuant to the agreement, and stamp duty is paid on that instrument, any SDRT already paid will be refunded (generally, but not necessarily, with interest) provided that a claim for repayment is made, and any outstanding liability to SDRT will be cancelled.",61
